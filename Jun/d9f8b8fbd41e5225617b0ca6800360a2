There was a heavy police presence
outside President Cyril Ramaphosa's Phala Phala farm on Saturday where some of
his livestock was on auction. Police in uniform and civilian
clothes were stationed outside the farm while the auction took place inside. The media was barred from covering
the event and journalists were ordered by the police to move away from the gate
of the farm. The police said the farm was
Ramaphosa's private residence and no journalist was allowed to enter. There was
also no cellphone network signal outside the farm. Inside the farm, however, there was
a hive of activity with many vehicles seen parked near a building where the
auction was taking place. The animals sold included Ankole
cows. The event was not the first the
president has had at his farm. READ: Cyril's millions: President off the hook Phala Phala farm was catapulted into

that about $4 million (R64 million) was stolen from the farm during a robbery
in 2020. He accused Ramaphosa of concealing
the crime and not reporting it to the police. He also stated that he had critical
evidence, including images and videos of the robbery.
