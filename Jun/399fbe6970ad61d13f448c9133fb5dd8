NYANGA residents in Cape Town are heartbroken that their station commander, Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata, is leaving the cop shop. Ncata, who has worked hard in the area since 2014, will soon start his new position in the Eastern Cape after he was recently promoted to being major-general. When Ncata arrived in the area in 2014, Nyanga was known as Mzanis’s murder capital. But now, it is not in the top 20 places known for murder cases. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ncata said: “When I arrived, Nyanga had 305 murders in 2013 but in 2015, the numbers began to fall. “Nyanga was known as the murder capital. If you ask a person they think Nyanga is still on top because it was a tittle we had for many years. One of the demands I got from the residents when I arrived at the station was for us to shake off that title and I knew it was not an easy job.” Resident, Nondumiso Mayeki (45), said it hurts to see Ncata go. He leaves at the end of the month. She remembered how he helped her in the middle of the night when her car was stolen in 2017. “I called his cellphone number and he answered at that time of the night. Within a few minutes, cops helped me hunt for the car and we found it three hours later. “He even called me the following day to check if we got the car. He is a hardworking cop. It is our loss, but I wish him the best as he gave himself to the Nyanga community,” she said. new place because of him.” Nyanga Community Policing Forum secretary, Dumisani Qwebe, said: “We once discussed with my chairperson saying Brigadier Ncata has left may get a promotion soon because he works too much. Surprisingly we later heard that he indeed got it. “We got depressed for that moment, but we are happy for him.Nyanga a better place. We wish him all the best. He must go and improve other areas. “We will continue fighting crime to ensure his legacy lives on.”
