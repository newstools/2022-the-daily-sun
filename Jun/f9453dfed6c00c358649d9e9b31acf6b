YOUNG people can unleash their creativity if they follow in the footsteps of gogo Noria Mabasa. The 84-year-old gets her creativity from listening to her ancestors in her dreams. Gogo Noria from Tshigalo in Venda, Limpopo, who is a woodcarver, only attended formal schooling for a year. But she listened to her ancestors when they told her what to do to succeed. And today she’s a successful woodcarver. In 1976, gogo Noria was the first Venda woman to do woodcarving. She said she was ridiculed and labelled as crazy when she took on the task of carving. “When my ancestors called on me to take up woodcarving, I answered the calling. “I do not carve anything until I see it in a dream. Therefore, I sometimes take naps during the day,” she said. She said she grew up poor but her family’s living conditions improved as soon as she embraced the gift her ancestors gave her. ALSO READ |
