CHRIS Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto has become the third hospital in Gauteng to be engulfed by fire. On Wednesday, 22 June, a fire broke out at the hospital’s Covid-19 section and it also spread to other sections. Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana confirmed that there was a fire at the hospital. “The fire started in the open space near the Covid-19 tents. Due to strong winds, the fire spread to the laundry site and damaged a part of the linen awaiting disposal. “The City of Joburg Fire Services from Dobsonville and Jabulani arrived on time before the fire could spread to the usable linen area and the building. There were no casualties due to the fire,” she said. Not long ago, a fire broke out at Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Tshwane, damaging a section where temporary structures had been erected. Last year, Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital was also on fire. The fire at this Joburg hospital was bigger and left damages that resulted in the closure of the casualty, the specialist psychiatric ward, and the cardiothoracic ICU for over a year. The effects of that fire are still felt even today, with the majority of patients being diverted to surrounding hospitals.
