  The talented Bafana Bafana player was announced by Chiefs on Tuesday night after weeks of negotiations. It is understood Sekhukhune have asked for R6 million transfer fee and Chiefs wanted to settle the amount in two instalments. However, the Sekhukhune owners demanded a full amount of the player, and the R3m Chiefs wanted to pay as first instalment was declined. However, on Tuesday, Chiefs unveiled the player, which means he has finally signed on the dotted lines and both clubs are happy. "Maart will join the team for the preseason training this wee," Chiefs said in a statement. Maart adds to the list of Siyathemba Sithebe, Zitha Kwinika and Ashley du Preez, Dillan Solomons, Kamohelo Mahlatsi and Lehlogonolo George Matlou all unveiled on Monday. Amakhosi also promoted talented youngster Mduduzi Shabalala to the first team after signing a three-year deal with the club.
