FREE STATE police are searching for three unknown suspects who robbed stokvel members at gunpoint on Tuesday, 7 June. Captain Stephen Thakeng said the gunmen took stokvel money, cellphones and a safe. According to Thakeng, it is alleged that at about 6.30pm, a woman (53) who is the treasurer of a stokvel was sitting with her friends inside her vehicle when three unknown men approached and pointed a firearm at them. “The suspects then demanded stokvel money and the woman responded that she did not have cash. The woman was then forced inside the house at gunpoint and she told them where the cash was,” he said. Thakeng said the suspects took the unmounted safe and two cellphones and fled the scene on foot. “The victim ran to her neighbours and requested them to call the police, who responded immediately and started the manhunt for the suspects. A case of house robbery was registered for further investigation,” he said. Thakeng warned stokvel members not to keep money in their homes. Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects is urged to contact Detective Warrant Officer Sanet Smit of Winburg Detective Services on 082 466 7678 or CrimeStop at 08600 10111.
