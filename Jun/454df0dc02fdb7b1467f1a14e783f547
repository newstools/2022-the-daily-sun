GODFREY Mabale keeps bees for the production of organic honey, propolis and wax. The 45-year-old from Kanana in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, said he developed a love of working with bees after matric and couldn’t find a job. He said if people have challenges with bees, they should not kill them, but rather contact him to remove them so that he continues to grow his beehive. Godfrey is the founder of Tshwane Bee Keepers and works with five other people. He said his challenge, especially during the winter season, is land and transport to move the bees to a place where there are flowers in order for them to survive.  “I use community radio stations to alert people and for them to inform us whenever they think bees pose a safety threat,” he said. “We urge residents not to kill bees because they play an important role in our lives.” Godfrey said the space where they store the bees is not big enough. “To the public, please help us grow this business and be able to create job opportunities for others. “My love for keeping bees dates back to 2001 after I acquired training through the Agricultural Research Council. “So far, it is difficult but the passion I have for this keeps me going. “I’m currently renting a plot to keep the bees there. My wish is to get a bigger place where to house more bees in,” he said.
