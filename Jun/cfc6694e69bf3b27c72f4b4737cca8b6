THE much-anticipated bail application hearing of the man who allegedly killed his mum was not heard in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court, Free State, on Friday, 24 June, due to power failure. The first state witness, investigating officer Tshidiso Maleme, was expected to take the stand to oppose bail against Teboho Mokoena (30). In the previous appearance on Tuesday, the court was forced to adjourn due to power cut. Mokoena had submitted to the court to grant bail because he was being abused in custody. “I do not understand the charges against me. I was tortured with a plastic bag put over my head. I nearly suffocated. I’m asthmatic and the blankets in custody are not hygienic. I want to be out so I can explain to my family what happened.” However, his uncle and family spokesman Mohlomi Khodumo said they were disappointed about the postponement. “We were hoping that the court would deny him bail, of which would be the beginning of justice prevailing.” The accused is facing charges of murder and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The deceased’s body was found chopped into pieces, head, hands and legs cut off. It was alleged that a saw, butcher knife and sharp lookalike knife instrument were seized as exhibit. The matter was postponed to Thursday, 30 June.
