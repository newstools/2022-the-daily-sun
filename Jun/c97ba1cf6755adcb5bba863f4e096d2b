A TEACHER was left critical after being shot in the head
outside his school. It was just after 8 am earlier today (Tuesday) when the
tragic incident happened in Newlands, Durban. This left the residents living close to the school in great
shock. A resident who asked not to be named said she was
accompanying her daughter to school when the shooting took place. “I got so scared and decided to go back home with my
daughter because I was afraid,” she said. She said she didn’t see the make of the car but she
remembers that it was black. The spokesman for the Emer-G-Med paramedic Kyle van Reenan
said their paramedics together with Netcare911, responded to the scene of a
shooting incident at a school in the Newlands West area of Durban. He said on arrival at the scene a man believed to be
approximately thirty years of age was found lying on the roadway next to a
vehicle. “Closer inspection found the man to have sustained a single
gunshot wound to the head and he was in a critical condition. Emergency Care Practitioners worked fervently to stabilize
the man before he was transported rapidly by ambulance to a nearby hospital for
further definitive care,” he said. He said the circumstances surrounding the incident and the
events proceeding it are unclear and will form the subject of a South African
Police Services investigation. The KZN cops spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Nqobile Gwala
said it's alleged that a 28-year-old teacher was at Riverdene Drive in Newlands
West when he was shot in the head by three unknown suspects.
