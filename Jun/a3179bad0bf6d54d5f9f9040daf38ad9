THE Western Cape health department says it’s ready to respond to any possible cases of monkeypox and urges the public not to panic. This come after a 32-year-old man in the province was recorded as the country’s second case of the infection on Tuesday, 28 June. The first case was recorded in Gauteng on 23 June. The department said: “Local health teams and outbreak teams have been alerted and are on the lookout to identify cases. “Western Cape government health and wellness is prepared and ready to respond to any possible cases. “Members of the public who experience symptoms similar to monkeypox are urged to report to their nearest healthcare facility or health worker for diagnosis and treatment. There is no need for public panic as monkeypox is not highly contagious or easily transferable. It needs close contact to be transferred.” The National Institute of Communicable Diseases said in the second case, the man had no recent history of travelling. “Currently, it is not known if the first and second cases are linked,” it said. Monkeypox presents as a fever and general flu-like symptoms, followed by the eruption of a blister-like rash on the skin.
