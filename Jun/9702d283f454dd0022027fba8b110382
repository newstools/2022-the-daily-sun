THEY left home on 3 April to go to the mountain and all 310 boys returned alive on Friday, 3 June. The boys went for circumcision under Chief Solly Nkoana at Mandela Village, near KwaMhlanga, in Mpumalanga. Nkoana told Daily Sun he has been sending boys to get circumcised for the past 26 years and no child has ever died at his camp. “I am very happy that all the children that I sent to the mountain came back alive. “There were no injuries reported. My ancestors are with me and they help guide me and protect the boys. “Now that they are back, I would like them to stick to everything they were taught by their elders. Respect is a key to long life. “The children must go back to school and stay away from drugs and alcohol. They must know that their parents will remain parents and going for initiation doesn’t give them a licence to be disrespectful,” he said. President of Moshate Initiation Forum, Jacky Motlhake, warned the initiates not to take drugs and drink alcohol. “As your elders, we don’t expect to hear bad news about you. You have been taught well to become men of the future. No drugs, alcohol and committing crime,” he said. One of the initiates, Linda Masilela (46), was the oldest among the initiates. He said he had been avoiding his culture for the past 16 years. “When my father was still alive, he wanted to send me to initiation but I refused. “Now things are not going my way and I am forced to do it. I had to leave my job and go to the mountain. I now feel like a real man,” he said. The youngest initiate, Kgontse Mohlala (13) said: he wasn’t scared to go to the mountain. “I am very happy that I am now a man.I will live by all the lessons I have learned at the mountain.” A parent, Mary Msiza (49), said she is happy that her son was taken good care of and is back alive.
