A 70-YEAR-OLD gogo was trampled to death by an elephant in Raipal village, Eastern India, on 9 June. According to Daily Mail, Maya Murmu was out collecting water when the escaped elephant came out of nowhere and trampled her. Inspector Lopamudra Nayak said the gogo died later in hospital due to severe injuries. And as if that was not enough, it is reported that the same elephant returned on the evening of the funeral while the family was paying their last respects to the slain gogo.
