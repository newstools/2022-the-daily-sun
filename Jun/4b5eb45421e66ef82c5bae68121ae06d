TWO recyclers have been shot and killed at infamous Robinson
Deep landfill site in Devland, south of Joburg this week. The City of Joburg’s department of Environment & Infrastructure
Service (EISD) confirmed the fatal shooting on Saturday 18 June 2022. It is said that the two informal recyclers were shot dead by
unknown assailant in the early hours of Thursday evening. MMC of EISD, Michael Sun said, “Senseless violence has taken
the lives of two individuals trying to eke out a living in the informal waste
economy. “This is completely unacceptable. Pikitup has been trying to
provide conducive environments in support of the waste recycling sector but
criminal element continues to filtrate into our facilities. We will be taking
swift action to intensify security measures at the landfill site”. SAPS and forensic pathology services were called to the
scene and are investigating a case of double murder. Their killings are
suspected to be part of a turf war between rival waste picking groups. READ: PIKITUP BLOODBATH: MHLENGI’S FAMILY SHATTERED! The area is notorious for killings. Early this year 5

opportunity for economic development. But this must be done orderly and
peacefully. “As a result of this latest incident, we will now request
for the assistance of police to conduct random searches for weapons and other
contrabands on persons entering our facilities and ensure that all re- claimers
operating on- site adhere to the rules and regulation of the site.”
