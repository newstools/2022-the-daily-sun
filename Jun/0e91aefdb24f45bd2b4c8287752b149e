TWO lesbians are living in fear after they were attacked by two men on Friday, 27 May. One of the women (25) said they were at a tavern in Mandela Park in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, when a man accused her of getting more attention from girls than him. The woman said she had gone into the tavern to check on her 31-year-old girlfriend, who was inside. She said she waited outside and one of the men dragged her inside after she said she’d prefer to remain there. She said she was beaten with fists and kicked. READ: 'I hate gays, so die' “I asked them why they were beating me up and they said every time I went to the tavern, women became interested in me and I took girls from them,” she said. “They said I’m a woman, and they could not be competing for girls with me. I told them to kill me if they wished.” The woman’s girlfriend said one of the men was someone she grew up with. She said a few weeks earlier, he had sexually harassed her. “He touched my bum but I told him never to do that again, and started maintaining my distance from him,” she said. She said while the men were assaulting her girlfriend, she heard them saying she must stop being a man and lesbian. She said when she tried to stop them, they also beat her up. She said one choked and threatened to kill her. Police spokeswoman Ndakhe Gwala said one of them was arrested, and a case of common assault and intimidation was opened. “He was arrested at about 4am at Sibanye informal settlement. Harare police arrested the 32-year-old on Monday,” she said.
