DESPITE the huge discrepancies in the evaluation of the Bafana Bafana midfielder, Sekhukhune United have  finally agreed to a multimillion Rand deal with Kaizer Chiefs. Though unclear, but our source speculated that it could be R5 million transfer. SunSport can reveal that Sekhukhune and Chiefs have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of the top midfielder, Yusuf Maart . The 26-years-old is set to sign his new deal with the Soweto giants when he returns from the Bafana Bafana duty. Maart, who turns 27 next month, was on the bench when Bafana lost 2-1 to Morocco in their 2023 Afcon qualifier in Rabat. He has been closely monitored by Chiefs and other top cluns, including Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates following his exceptional performances in Babina Noko’s first season in the DStv Premiership. The former Orlando Pirates youngster is seen by many as one of the top midfielders in the country, and has produced an unbelievably prolific career.He has recorded 28 league appearances for Sekhukhune, while scoring three goals. Maart’s current contract was due to end in June 2023, though they do have an option to extend for a further year. Efforts to get hold of Sekhukhune CEO Jonas Malatji drew a blank, but our source negotiations are at an advanced stage."It is as good as done," said our mole.
