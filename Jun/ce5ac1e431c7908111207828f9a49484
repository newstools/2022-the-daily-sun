KAIZER Chiefs have confirmed that Samir Nurkovic contract will not be extended by the club. The Serbian's three-year contract with the Amakhosi is expected to expire at the end of June and the club confirmed that they will not renew it. "Kaizer Chiefs will not extend Samir Nurkovic’s contract when it expires on 30 June 2022, ending a three-year relationship. The popular Serbian forward began his Chiefs career like a house on fire, scoring 14 goals in his maiden season," said Chiefs in a brief statement on Wednesday. Nurkovic arrived at in SA in 2019 under coach Ernst Middendorp. His first stint with the club was a fruitful one as he scored 14 goals in 31 appearances for the club. However, the last two years of his stay at the club was affected by the nigglinbg injuries which saw him earning less game time and struggling to get back to the form he showed on his arrival. In the recently ended season, Nurkovic managed to find the back of the net only once and spent better half of the campaign out injured.
