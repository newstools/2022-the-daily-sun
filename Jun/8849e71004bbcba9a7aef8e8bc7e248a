DAVID Mhlongo’s life is hanging by a thread due to load shedding. Because of his lung problem, the 54-year-old from Tshepisong, Gauteng, needs to be taken to hospital regularly. He started using an oxygen machine in March. But his life is only getting worse because of load shedding. “We experience terrible power cuts in our area,” said David. “The power is on for only two hours a day. Most of the time I have to rent a generator just to survive.” David is unemployed and relies on his wife, who does temporary jobs and the neighbours. “The generator costs R100 per day and the petrol depends on what we can afford. If not, I have to go to hospital,” said David. He said the hospital constantly reminds him there’s too many of them to be attended to. David said not only do they experience extensive load shedding, they also have a cable that gets cut. Residents suspect it might be the cause of their power outage. “Even on days when Mzansi isn’t experiencing any load shedding, we’re in the dark.” He said he hates being a burden to his wife and kids. “They get worried when I start getting weak. “I need an oxygen machine that doesn’t need electricity,” he said. He used to be the provider in his home but now he just sits at home all day. Neighbour, Amos Ndou, said their area seems to have more problems than most. Community leader, Thuli Sedile, said it’s sad to see how David suffers. City Power spokesman, Isaac Mangena, told Daily Sun they went to the place to check and are currently dealing with the matter.
