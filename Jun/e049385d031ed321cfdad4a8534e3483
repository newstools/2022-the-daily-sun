TWO pupils from Leondale Secondary School in Ekurhuleni were caught on camera smoking dagga at their school. This not only embarrassed the pupils but also their fathers, who are pastors in different churches. But now, Nceba Ngwenya (19) and Katlego Mabena (18), who are in grade 12 and 11 respectively, don’t even crave dagga. And today, 16 June, they took part in a march organised by the school to commemorate Youth Day.

Nceba said: “I want young people to know their purpose and not be involved in drugs, as they will destroy them. Before the video, I didn’t know better. But now I know my purpose.” After the video went viral, Gauteng Department of Education wanted them suspended. But the department then reversed the decision as it felt pupils being out of school would lead them back into drugs. This as they would then have plenty of time to smoke. And, according to Nceba, half of the school participated in the dagga party that day.
