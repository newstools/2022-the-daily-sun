PULE Ratselane can’t get around in a wheelchair as the roads in his village are too bad for him to travel on them. The 46-year-old from Kudumane Village in QwaQwa, Free State, said life has been difficult since his leg had to be amputated more than 10 years ago. The village is 15km from a main road and according to residents, the local roads were last maintained by their Bantustan government. Pule told Daily Sun: “I haven’t been able to move around since 2009. I wrote so many letters to the Maluti-a-Phofung and Thabo Mofutsanyane District municipalities. They just come here during election campaigns to give us empty promises. “My humble plea is for a simple gravel road for public transport to go through. As a social grant recipient, I have to pay R300 every month for someone to fetch my disability grant and buy me groceries. It’s a curse to be disabled and stay in a village such as this one,” he said.  Disabled People South Africa chairman Teboho Monkoe said he became aware of the situation back in 2014 and there needed to be a provincial summit for people living with disabilities. “We even went to the village with top government officials and all the usual promises were made. I honestly feel this man’s right to free movement has been taken away,” he said. Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality Infrastructure MMC Shashapa Motaung said he recently met Pule. “We’re trying to make a plan as to how we can assist him. I understand it’s difficult to live in this situation. “We’re in the process of constructing a road and a bridge, but the recent flooding makes it harder. We’re a new administration and we are fixing the mess left by the ANC,” he said.
