TERRENCE Mashego has been released from the Bafana Bafana camp and will not travel to Morocco on Saturday evening. Bafana are leaving Mzansi to Morocco for their 2023 Afcon qualifying match against the Atlas Lions in Rabat on Thursday. Update from the camp revealed that the Cape Town City defender suffered a knee injury. As he leaves the camp, the 23-year-old is confident that the remaining players in his position Innocent Maela and Lyle Lakay will do the job. "It's is a bad situation (that I am going home), but I think it is not a bad injury. The doctors said it is a meniscus tear," Mashego told the Bafana media department. "I was looking forward to this game but we still have Lyle Lakay and Innocent Maela who I belive will do the job. Right now I just have to focius on my injury and make sure I bounce back." Bafana are in Group K with Morocco and Liberia. Zimbabwe who were also in the same group have been barred from taking part in the next edition of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualification round after they failed to have their suspensions lifted by the world football governing body Fifa. The first and runner-up teams in Group K will qualify for the final tournament.
