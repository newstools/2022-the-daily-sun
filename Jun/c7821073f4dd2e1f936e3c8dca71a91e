MPUMALANGA police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has vehemently condemned an incident in which two minors were allegedly kidnapped in Graskop on Friday, 17 June. Three suspects were arrested in connection with the kidnapping incident. According to the report, on the said day two boys, both aged 15 from two separate families were allegedly locked up at a certain house in Graskop. Subsequent to the information reaching the community in the area, a group converged to go to a house where the two kids were suspected to be held in. Nonetheless, police in the area were not informed about the disappearance of the children. It is said that the group of people proceeded to the residence of a lady, thereby inquiring on the whereabouts of the kids upon arrival. However the woman reportedly informed them that the children were not available at the time but were rather in Marite near BushbuckRidge. It is further indicated that these members of the community lost patience and reportedly forced their way through into a hut. They then found the two boys who appeared to have been in an unstable state of mind. It is further said that the children had some visible wounds on their bodies. The woman is said to have then been assaulted by the group and she sustained some injuries. Police were alerted about the developments and they swiftly went to the scene. The police then apprehended the 49-year-old woman as well as a 17-year-old boy and a 24-year-old man on charges of kidnapping. The woman was taken to hospital for treatment and she’s under police guard while the other two males were detained. The 24-year old man has already appeared in the Graskop Magistrates Court and was remanded in custody. His matter was postponed to 12 July for further investigation. Meanwhile, the police are working in collaboration with probation officers as the other arrested suspect is a minor who is also expected to appear in court soon.
