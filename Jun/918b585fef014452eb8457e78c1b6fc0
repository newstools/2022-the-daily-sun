A VIDEO of an unidentified white man who pulled out a gun on an unarmed 16-year-old black boy in Groblersdal, Limpopo, has gone viral. In the video, the man wearing a red jacket and shots, can be seen holding a gun on the right hand and dragging the boy with his left hand. As the young man tries to protect himself from the attack, the man starts kicking him while he’s on the ground. As he starts kicking the boy, people can be heard in the background shouting and trying to stop the armed man from kicking the boy to a pulp. “Just because you have a gun. Just because you have a gun… you are not a God. We are going to expose you,” the person taking the video said. Following that, the man can be seen walking away from the scene to his car.   Police spokesman Motlafelo Mojapelo said a case of assault to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) has been opened at the Groblersdal cop shop on Thursday, 16 June. Mojapelo said the fight started inside a restaurant over the use of salt and a fight broke out. According to Mojapelo said the man is known to the cops and he will be arrested in due course. The young man has reportedly been complaining about chest pains following the incident.
