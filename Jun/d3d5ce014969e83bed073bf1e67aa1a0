THE BOOKING of Lebo Sekgobela for the Limpopo Legends Awards was officially done and dusted. But organiser Mphoza Mashabela was in for a rude surprise when Lebo’s management pulled out. “THEY DUMPED US WITH A WHATSAPP MESSAGE!” SAID MPHOZA. Mphoza said he has been talking to Lebo’s management and the booking was already finalised. “I explained that we will be getting payment from our sponsors before the end of June,” said Mphoza. “They seemed to understand and even sent us a quote. We were fine with it.” But then they got dumped with a text message. According to her manager, Lebo will be performing in Lesotho therefore, she will not be attending the awards event. “Her manager said we took too long to pay. We are hurt and disappointed by this,” said Mphoza. The award-winning gospel artist apparently changed her mind because of the non-payment of the deposit. The awards are scheduled to take place on 29 October 2022. The recipients include actress and musician, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, actor Obed Baloyi, actress Elsie Rasanalavho, actor Seputla Sebogodi, radio presenter Max Mojapelo and musician Joe Shirimane. Lebo confirmed the booking but said she was not paid. “We were invited to be part of the awards ceremony. We gave the organiser a quotation with terms and conditions of payment to secure the booking,” she said. “They did not pay and we were left with no option but to let the date go. I called to inform them that 29 October is no longer available, so we are not going to be part of the event.” She said the organiser was not supposed to market his event using her name before payment. “He requested a quotation, which we sent. The next step was for him to pay the deposit to secure the date and then we would send him the pictures for marketing. “We did not get any deposit and we are not committed to this event,” she said.
