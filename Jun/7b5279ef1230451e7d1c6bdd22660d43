AFTER years of struggling to juggle school and the entertainment industry, DJ and producer DJ AJ Mafokate has finally graduated. The 28-year-old media personality, who is the son of the kwaito legend Arthur Mafokate, experienced stumbling blocks along the way, but he has finally finished. He earned a BCom in strategic management from Varsity College. AJ said school was a challenge for him to juggle while being in the limelight. “I’m not going to lie, right after high school, I wanted to take a gap year, but my parents weren’t supportive of that. They wanted me to continue schooling, even if it was a short course, they wanted me to keep going. So I applied for this course and shortly after I started it, I also started my musical career and TV presenting. That was a bit of a challenge,” said AJ. “I finished my first year, but I had to drop out in my second year because the pressure had gotten too much. My career in entertainment was going really well and I chose to continue with it,” he said. ALSO READ : Shisaboy: It’s been very hard! He finally went back to school in 2019, but was told he needed to start the course all over again. “I decided it was time to go back to school, however, when I got there, they said I needed to start again. In 2020, Covid-19 hit, so I got to focus on my work because there were less performances due to the pandemic. I have come a long way and it feels great to finally complete it,” said the musician. AJ said he isn’t sure about what he’ll use his qualification for yet. “I do want to do some corporate work and work for big companies. If the right opportunity presented itself, I would definitely take it. But I think the course already helps me with what I do,” he said.
