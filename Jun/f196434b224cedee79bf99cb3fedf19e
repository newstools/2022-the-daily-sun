MPUMALANGA police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela, has warned residents to be careful during the winter period to prevent the loss of life. Her stern warning comes after a two-year-old boy died after he accidentally burnt himself in Daggakraal, Mpumalanga, on 15 June. He said low temperatures and load shedding experienced throughout the country drove members of the public to seek alternative ways to keep themselves warm. However, these methods are not always safe. “During the winter season, accidental deaths due to fire and other causes are sadly experienced where most of the victims are unfortunately children. People resort to various options to warm themselves up. At times, some of the practices are hazardous, more especially when used by children without adult supervision. “This could be a recipe for disaster, resulting in fatal accidents. For instance, on 15 June, a two-year-old boy became a victim of such an incident at Daggakraal. It is alleged that on that fateful day, the child pulled a kettle with hot water inside. He was taken to a local clinic and later transferred to Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela where he unfortunately succumbed to his injuries. An inquest case was opened,” Manamela said. She urged members of the public to take precautions when using appliances such as gas stoves, paraffin stoves, heaters, home-made fires or imbawula in an effort to get warm during this cold season. “It is on each parent’s shoulder to be vigilant, more so now that the children are on school holidays.”
