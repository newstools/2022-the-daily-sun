RESIDENTS of Harare in Khayelitsha were left shocked after a man was brutally murdered on Ntlazana Street on Saturday, 25 June. Onlookers said two ruthless thugs robbed the man of his cellphone while he was walking along the main road. It is alleged that the man received a call and answered, and the two thugs who were walking in the opposite direction pounced on him. They wanted his cellphone and stabbed him when he tried to resist. Angry residents tried to look for the killers but they had already disappeared. “They stabbed to kill him. If it was only to rob him, they would have probably stabbed him in the hands or somewhere just to scare him. But in this instance, they went for the neck and chest,” said a shocked resident. Sergeant Wesley Twigg said: “The circumstances surrounding the incident where an adult male was stabbed to death on Ntlazana Street, Khayelitsha, are still under investigation. “He was taken to a medical facility where he was declared deceased. A murder case docket was opened for investigation. The suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested,” said Twigg. Twigg urged anyone with any information about this incident to go to their nearest police station or contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
