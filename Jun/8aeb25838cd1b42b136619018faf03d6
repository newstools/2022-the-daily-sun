A MAN who was wanted by the police, for allegedly killing his lover, made his first appearance before the Amersfoort Magistrates Court on Monday, 20 June. But the same court had him remanded in jail for legal representation until 20 July. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed that Charlie Shabangu (29) was sought in connection with the murder of his girlfriend, which occurred at the beginning of the month. “The police arrested the suspect on 18 June through information provided by the community. Shabangu’s girlfriend, Nomalanga Zwane (34), was murdered allegedly by the suspect in the early hours of 6 June. It is further alleged that he assaulted the brother of the deceased as he tried to rescue her from domestic violence. Then he fled the scene, allegedly with Zwane’s cellphone as well as that of the brother,” he said. He said investigators had been working tirelessly to find the suspect, who had been on the run since the incident. “Police were notified by citizens about the suspect, who was seen hitchhiking from Piet Retief towards Wakkerstroom. Police acted swiftly, with clear description of the car he was reportedly in. They intercepted the car and upon noticing cops, the suspect alighted from it and tried to run, but they managed to catch up with him.” He was charged with murder and assault with intent to cause grievous harm. Commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has sent a strong message to perpetrators that cops will not treat issues of gender-based violence with velvet hands. “We mobilised all our resources in the investigation of this case, and we are confident that justice will be served for the Zwane family and all victims of gender-based violence. We also thank the public for always assisting us with valuable information on the whereabouts of suspects,” she said.
