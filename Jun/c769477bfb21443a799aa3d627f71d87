HUNDREDS gathered in prayer at the home of slain teacher Modiehi Mokoena (62) at Riverside in QwaQwa, Free State on Thursday, 16 June. She was allegedly killed by her son, who has been arrested for the murder. The churches and women’s organisations from the Thabo Mofutsanyana region, and about 500 members of the ANC Women’s League, participated in the prayers that continued for the whole day. South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) said Mzansi should implement the know your neighbourhood campaign. Sadtu regional treasurer Mapule Nchocho and Lucy Matsipa, SACP’s regional chairwoman, said Mzansi needed to do what people do in Cuba where they have street committees led by credible women, because women raise kids with the positive values of ubuntu, caring, loving and supporting one another. “The deceased was a member of Sadtu. We have lost a caring person who always fought for quality education in the Free State,” said Nchocho ANC Women’s League chairwoman, Masetjhaba Mosia-Lakaje, said they were praying that the accused won’t get bail. She said they were helping the family with funeral preparations. The chairman of Thabo Mofutsanyana church fraternity, Reverend Thule Mmile, said schools must bring back daily prayers. “This is an evil spirit that we need to overcome.” Mokoena’s husband said she will be laid to rest tomorrow. The son is expected to appear in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 21 June.
