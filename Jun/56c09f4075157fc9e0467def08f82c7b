HUNDREDS of mourners gathered to pay their last respects to popular traditional healer Salomao Macuvel’s funeral at his home in Rolle outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Sunday, 26 June. Funeral proceedings follwed a secret burial by his family at around 4am. Willy Makhubela (53) said his brother disappeared mysteriously from his home on Monday, 20 June. “We became worried when he didn’t return home. His cellphone and bakkie were left behind. We then reported the matter to the police, before spreading out searching for him in nearby bushes on the outskirts of the village,” Willy said. “We couldn’t believe our eyes when we found him dead, hanging from a tree near the train bridge in the bushes.” His fuming brother Noel Makhubela (54) said: “We have lost a great, humble, peaceful man. Cruel thieves stole three of his cows while they were grazing two months ago. He had never come right since then. He kept telling us he won’t live any longer.” His grandfather, Felisbrto Mabunda, said the family has lost a library and a good family historian. Mpumalanga Va-Gwena Clan Treasurer Joyce Makhubela- Nxumalo said: “We couldn’t believe our ears when we received the bad news of his death. He was the family clan’s national researcher and policy-making member. May his soul rest in peace.” Ward councillor Welcome Hlatshwayo said they were still shocked by the sangoma’s untimely death. Saddened village blockman, induna’s assistant Alfred Sibuyi said: “Enough is enough. We are tired of burying people from mysterious deaths, lightning, gunshots and this one. No matter how angry he could be, he would never take his own life. “We are strongly appealing to you, evil doers, to stop the barbaric killing of the innocent.” Salomao is survived by his wife, Norah Macuvel, and 12 children, some of whom he shares with two former wives. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed that an inquest case has been opened.
