RESIDENTS of Margate, KZN, believe that should cops make more arrests on people dealing in drugs, there would be less crime and violence in the area. They believed the use of drugs led to crime and violence. Therefore, the more drug dealers were caught, the less crime they would worry about. And following the arrest of a 42-year-old man who was caught transporting drugs worth more than R1 million on Monday, residents are pleased. Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said cops were out in numbers to clean the province from drug dealings. Gwala said that the use and abuse of drugs contributed to the commission of serious and violent crimes. She said the provincial organised crime unit received information about a suspect who was travelling from Margate to transport drugs. “The vehicle was spotted along Maureen Street. It was intercepted and the driver searched, where 13 orange and white capsules of heroin were found in his pocket,” she said. Gwala said that the vehicle was also searched, and cops found 26 bags of crystal meth, eight of cocaine uncut stones, 24 ecstasy tablets, four of plastics containing empty capsules, weighing scale, 1L bottle of acetone chemical used to mix drugs and 22 boxes of infant powder. The recovered drugs are valued at R1,3 million. The man was arrested for possession and dealing in drugs, and is expected to appear before the Ramsgate Magistrates Court soon,” said Gwala. A resident told Daily Sun that although only one man was caught, the number of drugs he was found with would make a difference in decreasing use in the area. “It’s a fact that drugs are mostly used by young people, and this is killing their future. Some end up stealing in order to afford these drugs,” said the resident. Another resident said a lot of people were using drugs and when high, they became violent. “A lot of them abuse their families. We hope cops can make more arrests because that can lead to a crime- and violent-free area,” said the resident.
