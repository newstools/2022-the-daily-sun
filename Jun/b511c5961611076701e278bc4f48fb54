THREE years ago, the municipality built toilets. The toilets were supposed to be allocated to residents of Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. But they have now turned into homes for homeless people. The toilets had solar geysers and ablution facilities, which were all stolen by thugs, who then also started removing the roofs. The door and window frames are also gone and this has residents worried. “It pains us to live in backyards, while hobos have taken over. It’s just not right,” said one backyard dweller. The backyard dwellers have been at loggerheads with the Ekurhuleni Municipality for some time. At one point, they even took over newly-built RDP houses in Mayfield and Chief Luthuli. Metro cops had to forcibly remove them from the houses. Resident Nzamani Ndlovu (45) said: “We feel it’s a waste of money to erect structures which later go to waste.” ALSO READ | 'I married a MERMAID for power, riches and

According to Ekurhuleni Housing, the serviced stands were equipped with flushing toilets, solar geysers and bulk municipal services. Electrification was to be done once the beneficiaries had occupied the stands. Some of the backyard dwellers said they didn’t know when they would get stands. “There’s too much corruption in the municipality,” said one. Municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said he will investigate.
