A 10-YEAR-OLD girl was arrested for murder on Tuesday, 7 June. This after the teen, from Orlando in Florida, USA, allegedly shot and killed a woman who was involved in a fight with her mum. According to Fox 35 Orlando, the girl is accused of killing a 41-year-old woman last Monday. It is reported that the girl’s mum and another woman were in an argument when the mum handed the girl a bag with a gun inside.

Her mother was also arrested and charged with manslaughter, aggravated assault with a firearm and child neglect. Making her first court appearance on Wednesday, prosecutors said the teen was considered a threat to the public. “While I understand her age is a component, we have to look at the nature of the offence as well as the charges and facts that have been alleged, for the community’s safety,” Shannon Corack told the court. The accused has since been held in juvenile detention, despite her father asking the judge to release her. The case was postponed to 28 June for further investigation.
