THE Presidency has promised to respond in due course to criminal charges laid against President Cyril Ramaphosa by former correctional services commissioner Arthur Fraser. Newly appointed spokesman Vincent Magwenya took to Twitter to announce that the president has been made aware of the charges laid against him. “President Cyril Ramaphosa was chairing a cabinet meeting until late in the evening yesterday. He has been informed about the Arthur Fraser statement. The Presidency will communicate in due course,” he tweeted. Fraser on Wednesday, 1 June shocked the nation when he revealed that he has opened a criminal case against Ramaphosa for charges ranging from kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and bribery. In a statement circulated on social media, Fraser said he opened the case at a Rosebank Police Station and has handed the police evidence supporting his allegations. The supporting evidence, according to his statement, included video footage, bank accounts, photographs and names of people. The charges emanate from the alleged theft of more than $4 million which was allegedly concealed at Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala Farm in Waterberg, Limpopo. Fraser said the millions in foreign currency were concealed on his farm. Fraser claimed the thugs colluded with the president’s domestic worker. Fraser also claimed that the thugs were later kidnapped and interrogated in the farm and the incident was hidden from the law authorities and people were later bribed, although he doesn’t specify who had been bribed. “I trust that the police and the prosecuting authorities will investigate this matter without fear or favour. I also trust that the president will take the nation into his confidence and accept or deny that the events I describe in my affidavit occurred on his property,” added Fraser.
