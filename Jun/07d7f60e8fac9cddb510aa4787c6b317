THE legal team representing murder-accused Sipho Mkhatshwa has decided to withdraw services. Advocate Sebastian Bhila told the Mbombela Magistrates Court on Friday, 3 June, that he wishes to withdraw because of conflict of interest. He further said he could not divulge the nature of the conflict as it might prejudice himself and the accused. When magistrate Edward Horn asked Mkhatshwa his position, he said he was not informed on the reasons for the withdrawal, however, he did not have any objections. The matter had to stand down for a few minutes to allow the legal team to explain the nature of the conflict. Mkhatshwa requested to instruct another legal representative for the continuation of the bail hearing. He said should he instruct a new lawyer, they should then start the process afresh. Mkhatshwa further asked the court to postpone the matter to allow him to find a new lawyer. He is facing charges of rape, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice as well as possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The 39-year-old and his two co-accused, Philemon Lukhele and Mduduzi Gama, are accused of raping and killing Hillary Gardee. The 28-year-old was reported missing on 30 April, and her lifeless body was found dumped at a timber plantation outside Mbombela on 3 May. The matter was postponed to 9 June. EFF national chairwoman Veronica Mente said the fact that the defence lawyers had decided to withdraw meant a lot. “It is actually telling us that our consciousness as the black society is now prevailing; they get to realise out of the cross-examination that they are representing a thug, murderer and liar.”
