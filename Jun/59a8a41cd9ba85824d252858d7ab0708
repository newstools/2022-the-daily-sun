SUPERSPORT United defender Luke Fleurs says interim coach Andre Arendse played a huge role in his quest to win the DStv Premiership Young Player of the Season award. Fleurs said Arendse encouraged him to step up his game when he replaced Kaitano Tembo who was sacked in April due to poor results. “The first day coach Arendse took over he called me after training and said ‘Luke, I know you can defend us, play your part in the last six games’” said Fleurs. “’You go in there do your job no matter who says what. If a senior player shouts at you take it (as a learning curve)’. I worked hard in training and he gave me that good feeling. He believes I can calm the game when everything is in a rush due to transition.” The 22-year-old has also credited his former teammate and Mamelodi Sundowns defender Grant Kekana for helping improve his game. Fleurs said he will start his pre-season early to improve other aspects of his game. He wrapped up the season on a high note as he helped his side to overcome Soweto giants Orlando Pirates 2-0 in their last league game of the season on Monday to qualify for the MTN8 Cup. Even though United management are rebuilding the squad with youth, Fleurs revealed that not having experienced players such as Onismor Bhasera, Bradley Grobler and Thamsanqa Gabuza due to niggling injuries affected their season. “The team is in the top eight because we had most of our seniors back against Pirates,” he added.
