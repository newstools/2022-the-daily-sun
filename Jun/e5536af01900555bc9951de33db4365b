THE North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane heard on Monday, 13 June, that the second controversial Senzo Meyiwa murder docket was an internal opinion from a junior advocate and it holds no merit in court. The docket became the centre of the trial on Wednesday, 8 June, when defence lawyer for accused number five, Advocate Zandile Mshololo, requested a postponement so she could go through the docket. On Monday, Mshololo said after reading the letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions in South Gauteng, she was ready to continue where she left off. State prosecutor Advocate George Baloyi and Mshololo agreed to postpone the trial to 5 to 16 September, and again on 4 to 14 November. But lawyer for accused one to four Advocate Malesela Teffo said he was denied the opportunity to object to the postponement of the trial. Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela asked the legal counsel to consult and determine a date for the next trial period. Court was adjourned for Tuesday, 14 June.
