GAVIN Hunt, Cavin Johnson and Owen Da Gama are set to go toe-to-toe for the Royal AM coaching position. The job became vacant after John Maduka resigned on Sunday to take over at Maritzburg United. Maduka, who guided Royal AM to third place in the DStv Premiership last season, was appointed by the Team of Choice on a three-year deal on Wednesday. This has opened a door for Royal AM to appoint a new coach. The trio are free agents. Hunt is unattached after he was fired by Chippa United in November. Johnson left Al Ahly last September, where he was the assistant coach. And Da Gama recently became unemployed after his departure from Sekhukhune United. As AM will be competing in the Caf Confederation Cup next season, the new coach must have a Uefa or Caf A coaching License according to the new Confederation of African (Caf) rules regarding coaches in charge of teams that compete in Caf competitions this coming season. Both Johnson and Hunt have Uefa A licenses and tick all the boxes in that regard. Da Gama has a close working relationship with AM CEO Sinky Mnisi from their days at now defunct Highlands Park where Mnisi was a director. Da Gama guided Highlands to automatic promotion to the DStv Premiership in the 2017-18 season. But he does not have the same Caf experience as Hunt or Johnson. But Da Gama was in charge of now defunct Platinum Stars that in 2008 became the first South African side to beat the Egyptian club Al Ahly, when they won a first-leg clash 2-1 in the third round of the Champions League. Johnson is familiar with KZN. He was appointed AmaZulu coach at the beginning of the 2017-18 season before he was sacked in September 2019.
