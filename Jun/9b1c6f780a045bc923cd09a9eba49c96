NOT only does the devastated mother have to deal with the rape of her three-year-old child, she is also disappointed at the way cops are handling the case. The woman from Somerset West, Western Cape, said she found out that her daughter was raped allegedly by the husband of a creche owner. And according to what the child told her, the brutal crime happened over some time. “I opened a case on 1 March but the man has not been arrested. I have been trying to get hold of the investigating officer but I’m not getting any information,” said the mother. The woman said when they took the child to the doctors, they found that there was blunt and forceful penetration on her anus. She said the doctors told her it was the worst case of anal rape they have seen in a long time. ALSO READ | Three kids die after ‘eating poisoned food meant

Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said the Nyanga Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit were probing the matter. “The investigation is at a sensitive stage. The investigating team will present their findings to the senior state prosecutor for a decision.” Swartbooi advised the family members to arrange a meeting with the commander of the unit investigating the case to discuss their concerns.
