AMADLOZI of a KZN sangoma have probably turned their backs on him. The sangoma was bust in the early hours of Tuesday, 28 June. He was found with guns which he didn’t have a satisfactory explanation for. Police spokeswoman Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said the man was arrested in a multi-disciplinary operation at Macambini Reserve in Nyoni. She said they received intelligence regarding a traditional leader who was in unlawful possession of firearms. Ngcobo said: “A search warrant was obtained and police proceeded to Macambini Reserve where the suspect resided. During a search of the house, police found two rifles, two pistols, a pellet gun and 189 rounds of ammunition. The 37-year-old suspect was arrested for unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition as well as for failing to safeguard firearms. “A preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect is linked to two cases of attempted murder that were reported at Nyoni SAPS between February and March 2021.” Ngcobo said the suspect appeared before the Nyoni Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 28 June, for unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. Bail was granted and he will appear before court on 30 August.
