A YOUNG woman claimed her boyfriend has raped her repeatedly and she wants justice. The 23-year-old from Dobsonville, Soweto, told Daily Sun they started dating in October last year after meeting at a pub. But then the 34-year-old allegedly started raping her in February until she ended the relationship in April. She said at first she thought it was just because of alcohol. “When he did it the first time I confronted him the following day and he apologised and promised to never do it again,” she said. “But then he kept doing it and wasn’t even unapologetic.” She said they lived together so when he came back from work he wanted sex and when she told him she didn’ feel like it, he told her that her job was to satisfy him. “He turned into this arrogant man.” She said she went back to her home and the man started harassing her. She said she went to the police to open a case but they weren’t helpful. “Sometimes they’d tell me to fix things with my man and sometimes they’d make me sit at the station the whole day until I’d give up and leave.” Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo advised the woman to speak to the station commander and she’ll get assistance.
