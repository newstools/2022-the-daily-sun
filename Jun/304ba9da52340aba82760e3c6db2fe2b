THE 2024 national election could be hanging in the balance. According to One South Africa leader Mmusi Maimane, Parliament is not doing what it should to implement electoral reforms ordered by the Constitutional Court. Maimane’s organisation and other interested parties have taken the government to court to demand reforms to allow independent candidates to contest elections. The current system only allows independent candidates to contest councillor positions. The deadline for making the reforms expired on Saturday, 11 June and the court granted Parliament a six-month extension. This means laws allowing independent candidates to take part in the national election should be passed by 10 December. But Maimane said the current draft bill was unconstitutional and could be challenged in court, threatening the 2024 election. “The bill didn’t go far enough. The bill, as proposed at the moment, doesn’t achieve much. It’s like saying to independent candidates, sure come run the comrades marathon but you must not have shoes on and you must run backwards.” Maimane said independent candidates would be required to pay money to contest the election, while parties were funded by the IEC. According to the proposed bill, independent candidates would have to win 80 000 votes in a province to get a seat in Parliament and would not qualify for the proportional representative vote.
