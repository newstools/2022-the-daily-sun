THE number of family members who died in a house fire in a home at KwaNhlalwane, southern KZN, has risen from five to seven. The house was burnt to the ground on Saturday night, 25 June, after they had a traditional ceremony to remember their late loved ones. After the ceremony, there was a loud bang and the house burnt down, destroying everything. Initially four people died in the blaze, followed by one who died in hospital on Sunday and another two family members succumbed to their injuries on Monday. On Tuesday, KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala was joined by social development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza to visit the family. Four children, two-week-old Zanokuhle, Onge (2), Noluthando (9), Anathi (9) and their mother Bongekile Mthembu (37), met their gruesome deaths after the house they were sleeping in caught fire. Four family members were rescued by neighbours and were rushed to the nearby clinic to be treated for inhalation and burn wounds. They were later transferred to hospital where Onge succumbed to his injuries on Sunday afternoon. The two family members who died in hospital were identified as Thobeka (31) and Ayabonga (7). A team of social workers was assigned to provide psycho-social support. Family spokesman Siphumelele Ngwabe said the tragic event happened right after they had finished a traditional ceremony to remember their relatives. “Because of this fire, we have lost seven people at once. Everything burnt down. We are left with nothing. We are in great shock,” he said. He said they were grateful for the support received from the Department of Social Development as well as the municipality. Zikalala said it was unimaginable that one family could lose seven members this way.
