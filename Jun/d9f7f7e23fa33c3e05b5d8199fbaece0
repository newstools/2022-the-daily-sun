AMAZULU confirmed the club have parted ways with 15 players on Thursday, with the biggest surprise being that of influential winger Luvuyo Memela. Memela was impressive last season and was the only player to score for the club in the Caf Champions League, where they earned seven points in the group stages. Usuthu president Sandile Zungu told SunSport the player was going nowhere, but that is no longer the case. Others released are Xola Mlambo, Philani Zulu, Neil Boshoff, Tapelo Xoki, Limbikani  Mzava, Tsepo Masilela, Kgotso Moleko, Hendrik Ekstein, Abraham Majok, Thabo Qalinge, Siphelele Mthembu, Andre de Jong, Augustine Mulenga and Siyethemba Sithebe. Sithebe is joining Kaizer Chiefs while Xoki is joining Orlando Pirates in a swap deal with Gabadinho Mhango. “Xoki has been acquired by Pirates while Sithebe has opted to not extend his contract with AmaZulu,” said Zungu in a statement. “As for the others, the club decided not to renew their contracts in view of our endeavours to rebuild for success in the forthcoming 2022-23 season. “We will announce the names of at least eight players who will be joining Usuthu in the coming days.” The club also confirmed the departure of assistant coach Vasili Manousakis and goalkeeper coach Moeneeb Josephs. “We would like to thank all the players and the members of the technical team for their service and wish them the best in their future endeavours.” Zungu added. This was expected as there have been reports that Usuthu’s finances have been hit by these players and coaches who were well paid well by the club.  Usuthu have signed Ishmael Wadi from JDR Stars.
