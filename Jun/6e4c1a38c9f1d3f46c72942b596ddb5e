A FAMILY of three is sleeping in the open after their three separate houses burnt down in their yard. The Buthelezis from Ezimpayini Village in Ulundi, northern KZN, believe the fire was caused by vutha as they don’t use fire or candles and there was no electrical fault. Thanda Buthelezi (54) said the suspected evil spell started on 4 April. She said: “I was sitting with my mother and sister at about 7pm when soil was thrown in our faces. We prayed and went to bed.” Thanda said three days later the evil spirit allegedly started throwing stones on the roof and at them. She said the attacks stopped on 27 April. Thanda said on that day there was suddenly smoke coming from another house. “We found a table cloth on fire. The fire started burning the bed and jumped around the house. We ran outside and watched as the flames ate everything.” The next day Thanda went to tell her father, who doesn’t live with them, what happened. Then Thanda’s mother Florence Buthelezi (73) said she saw smoke coming from one of the houses in the yard. The fire destroyed everything inside. ALSO READ |
Nissan Navara beats Hilux and Ranger On 30 April, the vutha set their last house on fire. “We’re forced to sleep in an open space in the yard. The neighbours won’t take us in because the spell will follow us,” said Florence. “We rely on prayer. But last Friday we realised we need more than just prayer. We are appealing to any sangoma who can help us get rid of this evil spell.”  Sangoma Mkhulu Bheki Zwane said the family is suffering a vutha spell combined with evil creatures throwing soil and stones at them. “They need to get rid of the spell because if there is nothing left to destroy it will claim their lives,” he said. KZN Traditional Healers chairman Thandonjani Hlongwane said these evil spells do exist and they are sent to destroy the family.
