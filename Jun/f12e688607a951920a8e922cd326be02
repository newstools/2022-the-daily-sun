ZIMBABWE African National Congress (ZANC) president Timothy Mncube believes change is imminent. He said the worsening social, political and economic landscape meant trouble to the people, and that all was in their hands to make a change. “Our country needs a new governance that will bring change to the economy and improve the lives of our people. We can only see changes if people of Zimbabwe, who live back home, in South Africa and other countries, go out and vote in next year’s elections.” He urges all Zimbabweans to go home and register. “Come 2023, let us all go back home and vote for change. By voting, we will be creating a better country for all.” He added that ZANC was founded mainly for the need to bring about economic transformation in the country. “It is no secret that our economic situation has hit dire straits and brought a lot of uncertainty about the future of our country and young ones. “ZANC has looked at the current situation and realised an immediate need to transform the ailing economy. With inflation so high, investor confidence so low, corruption so rife and unemployment levels rising at an alarming rate, it is imperative that we bring change and the introduction of policies that will see a new bullish trend.” Mncube said he was appalled at the current economic conditions in their country. “I have engaged with several businesspeople who can bring serious investments, but they all say they cannot invest in an uncertain economic environment with an unstable currency whose value is distorted. “The current policies have failed us. The old ways of doing business have changed and it is important that we move with the times. We have the right tools and mindsets to bring about that positive change.” He said ZANC would host several rallies next year, with the main event to be held before the election. “The siyanqoba rally will be held at White City Stadium in Bulawayo before the ruling government announces the election date.”
