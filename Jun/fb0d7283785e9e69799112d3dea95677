THE Senzo Meyiwa murder trial has been postponed to Monday, 13 June. Defence Advocate Zandile Mshololo asked for a postponement after she received a new docket into the murder case on Wednesday, 8 May. She told the court she needed time to read the docket. This is the second docket into the case and accuses other suspects of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Mshololo said the state had violated the constitutional rights of his client, Fisokuhle Ntuli. She said the second docket showed there was a conflict of interest and the author needed to confirm the contents thereof. “In exhibit D, the director of public prosecutions North Gauteng decided that the following people be charged – Longwe Twala, Kelly Khumalo, Gladness Khumalo, Zandi Khumalo, Tumelo Madlala, Mthokozisi Thwala and Maggie Phiri,” she said. Mshololo said she needed to understand how the five people currently on trial were charged with killing Meyiwa while there was another docket opened charging the people who were in the house when Meyiwa died.
