TWO men are expected to appear in the De Aar Magistrates Court, facing charges of kidnapping and car theft. It’s alleged that the victim had employed the two men as bricklayers, as she was building and renovating her house in De Aar. On Monday, 13 June the two allegedly kidnapped the victim (30) and forced her into the boot of her Audi Q2 and drove off with her. Police spokesman Captain Olebogeng Tawana said the victim was in possession of her cellphone, and she managed to communicate with her mother via WhatsApp about the kidnapping ordeal and theft of her car. “Her mother immediately alerted the police about the alleged incident and police in De Aar reacted promptly and launched a search and tracing operation. The particulars of the victim and the car were circulated,” Tawana said. ALSO READ: Why men use IMBIZA!
