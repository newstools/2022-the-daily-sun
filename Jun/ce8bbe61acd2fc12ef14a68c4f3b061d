THE winner
of the R126 million National Lottery jackpot used only R22,50 to play on the
lucky day. According
to Ithuba, the woman from Florida in Joburg plans on spend the money wisely. In a
statement released by the national operator, she saud she was still processing
that she had really won the money. “I believe
the spirit of gratitude and giving is what has landed me at this point in my
life. I am yet to digest the news. I need time to re-evaluate the situation and
apply my mind. When I found out that I had won, I was in complete disbelief,
and I felt elated. Reality is only sinking in now that I’m here at Ithuba
offices,” she said. “We plan to
keep a very low profile with our feet on the ground. My partner and I are very
conservative people – we are not splashy, big spenders, so there will be no
Ferraris. Although we have been looking for property for quite some time, these
winnings will now help us to fast-track the process,” she added.
