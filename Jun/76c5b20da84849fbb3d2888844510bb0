SINCE the start of the lockdown in 2020, wearing face masks hasbecome the new normal. But South Africans can now finally breathe a sigh of relief as the regulation has been lifted. The SunTeam spoke to ordinary South Africans yesterday, 23 June, about how they felt about the news. Some said they were happy to finally breathe freely while many women said they were excited to show their faces again. Annah Mosane from Springs, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she was happy to wave the masks goodbye. She said the masks hid their faces, meaning potential boyfriends would pass by without even greeting them. “The masks hid our faces and we could not be seen properly. When you met someone, you had to take the mask off to know who it was,” she said. “With the mask on, someone would just pass you by and not even greet you.” ALSO READ |
