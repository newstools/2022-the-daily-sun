HOME Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi has accused the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF) of being destructive for taking his department to court over the cancellation of the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP). He called the court action “spurious” and warned that it can only cause further tensions between citizens and foreigners. Motsoaledi said on Tuesday, 28 June, that in an open and transparent democracy, civil societies had an important role to play but, at times, some of them could be a stumbling block in the implementation of government’s rational and lawful decisions. “The recent surprising court action launched by the Helen Suzman Foundation is a perfect example of the destructive role that some non-governmental organisations are capable of,” said the minister. He said he had always engaged the foundation regarding some of the challenges faced by the department in the past. The foundation launched legal action against the government’s move in November not to renew the permits which gave ZEP holders a 12-month grace period to apply for another type of permit, or leave the country. The foundation said there was not enough consultation. However, Motsoaledi said since the announcement of the decision, he had engaged with several members of civil society with a view to manage the consequences of his decision collectively. “This time around, the HSF was conspicuous by its silence. Little did the minister know that the HSF was behind the scenes planning the so-called “public interest” court action. The HSF, in its desperate bid to blackmail the nation, is twisting the support for the minister’s decision by the majority of South African citizens as being ‘xenophobic’. Nothing could be further from the truth,” said Motsoaledi.
