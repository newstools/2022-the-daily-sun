A FORMER employee at Capitec bank appeared in the Middelburg Magistrates Court on Monday, 6 June. The 28-year-old man is facing charges of fraud, theft and contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Hawks spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Philani Nkwalase said the accused allegedly colluded with two bank clients and overlooked essential supporting documents on their loan applications between November 2017 and April 2018. “He allegedly processed two applications with fraudulent documentations wherein two transactions of R130 521,05 and R100 000 were paid into the applicants’ banking details. A portion of the respective amounts was allegedly transferred to his account with another bank,” Nkwalase said. He said the accused, who worked as a bank teller, was fired from his job and the matter was reported to the police for further investigation. “He was arrested in Middelburg on Sunday, 5 June, by the Hawks team based in Nelspruit and he was released on R1500 bail shortly after his first court appearance today (Monday, 6 June). “He is expected to be back in court on 21 June. More arrests are expected and more possible charges cannot be ruled out,” Nkwalase added.
