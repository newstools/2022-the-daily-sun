THE case against Nelson Mandela’s grandson, Mbuso Mandela (30), was not called in the Alexandra Magistrates Court because the docket was locked in one of the offices. Mbuso was supposed to have his matter heard today, 29 June. Prosecutor Lufuno Maphiri told the court that the person working in the docket office had an emergency and no one had access to the office. “The officer who works in the docket office had an emergency at home. The docket is inaccessible,” said Maphiri. Daily Sun established that it was not only Mbuso’s case that was affected by the office being locked. Other cases had to be postponed as well. “We do not even know when the officer will come and what will happen to cases that are supposed to be heard tomorrow, 30 June,” said a court employee. Mbuso is facing charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and drugs. He was arrested at his apartment in Morningside, north of Joburg, after the police received a tip-off from his landlord. The landlord apparently stopped the men in blue during a routine patrol in the neighbourhood after complaints from other tenants. Mbuso’s lawyer, Advocate Jeff Lekalakala, told Daily Sun that he did not oppose the state’s request for postponement because it was not it’s fault. “I had to accept the state’s reason for the application for postponement. I understood the predicament they were facing,” he said. Mbuso is out on bail after his brother, Ndaba Mandela, came to his rescue and paid his R1 000 bail on 6 May. Ndaba later tweeted: “Bailed my brother out this morning. Been telling him for years now to watch the company he keeps. Can’t do time for other people’s kak! Hope the penny really dropped this time.” This is not the first time Mbuso has had a brush with the law. In 2015, he was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl at Mamma’s Shebeen in Greenside, Joburg. The case was later withdrawn in the Joburg Magistrates Court.
