THE STREETS of Selcourt are usually quiet during the day, with just an odd dog barking. However, the peace in this quiet suburb in Springs, Ekurhuleni, was disturbed on Tuesday, 14 June, when a gang of six thugs robbed two homes. AND INSTEAD OF CRAWLING UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS, THE THUGS PEACEFULLY ENTERED THE HOMES AND POLITELY ASKED THEIR VICTIMS TO CO-OPERATE OR ELSE . . . Two homes were hit in one afternoon in a space of hours and the police are now on the lookout for the mysterious gang. According to police, the thugs packed their loot in the victims’ cars and drove off nicely as if everything was fine. This was also not to alert neighbours that a house robbery had just taken place. But before they left, the thugs were nice enough to tell their victims where to retrieve their cars. And in both cases, a woman (57) and man (52) found their Dodge and VW Polo cars respectively where the thugs had told them to go. Sergeant Themba Tshabalala of the Springs Police Station confirmed the two incidents and warned other residents to be vigilant. “The robbers took items such as plasma TVs, jewellery, laptops, cellphones and electrical appliances. “The items, excluding the cars, in each robbery are worth more than R100 000,” he said. Tshabalala said the two victims found their cars with the keys still inside. The cars were where the robbers said they would be. One of the cars was found on the side of the road next to Springs Mall. “The victims are grateful that they were not harmed but the cops are working around the clock to arrest the suspects. “Victims said the suspects just wanted them to co-operate,” said Tshabalala. Anyone who has information on the robbers can contact Springs Police Station on 011 365 5700.
