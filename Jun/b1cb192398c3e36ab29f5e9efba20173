MAMELODI Sundowns Bolivian striker Erwin Saavedra has admitted to facing challenges in his first season in South Africa. The 26-year-old joined Sundowns in January and was expected to hit the ground running in the DStv Premiership. However, his six-month stay has been hindered by an injury which kept him on the sidelines for the longest time. Saavedra made his debut in the 1-0 CAF group stage win against Al-Hilal, where his sharp touches and quick movement left an early impression on Sundowns Supporters. Subsequent appearances followed before the Bolivian’s progress was halted with an injury picked up in Egypt when Masandawana took on Al Merrikh. Saavedra has opened up on the challenges he faced in his maiden season at the Chloorkop-based outfit and has vowed to bounce back stronger and make an impact next season. “First of all, it was a different experience to what I am used to. However, to win two trophies is great even though I got them not in the way I would have preferred, since I was injured,” he told the club website. “The coaches told me that injuries are part of football, and to me this is part of football I have never experienced before and it is new to me” Despite being out, the Bolivian did manage to lift two trophies in the form of the Nedbank Cup and the DStv Premiership. He added: “As a footballer, these are titles which will forever be part of my CV.” “I am only hoping to start the next season in the best manner possible, together we can achieve new objectives that we didn’t get to achieve this season.” Next season he will be expected to lead the Down attack with the likes of Peter Shalulile who was the top goal scorer in the past campaign.
