THE Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) picketed outside the Eswatini Embassy in Tshwane on Tuesday, 31 May. According to EFF provincial spokesman Philip Makwala, they were calling for democracy in Eswatini. He said they would also rally behind revolutionary movements such as the People’s United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) and Swaziland National Union of Students in their fight for democracy. “It is inspiring to see students and young people support such programmes and unity in the fight for freedom,” he said. Makwala said the government is resisting change by imposing curfew and deploying armed forces to protect the king’s infrastructure. He said protesters were disbursed with live ammunition, killing and injuring civilians. “Our demand to the Eswatini monarch and embassy is for the end of the ban of political parties and meetings, the return of political exiles to Eswatini, the end of federal system in which 85% of Eswatini people don’t have land and we demand the prosecution of King Mswati III for crimes against humanity.” He said they were giving the embassy seven working days to respond. Mlungisi Makhanya from Pudemo said: “People of Eswatini will be free very soon. We condemn the SADC (Southern African Development Community) organ on Troika led by President Cyril Ramaphosa for failing to stand firm against King Mswati III.” Futhi Msibi, chairwoman of Swaziland Liberation Movement, said: “This march continues to send a message to King Mswati III and the regime of Eswatini that their time is over.” EFF Tshwane chairman Obakeng Ramabodu sent back the secretary who was sent to receive their memorandum, saying they wanted someone senior like an ambassador to receive their memorandum, which never happened.
