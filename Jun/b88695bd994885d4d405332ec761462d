IT IS finally pay day and Mzansi streets are busy. However, the South African Police Service (SAPS) has issued a warning about the dangers of withdrawing large sums of cash. In a statement released on Friday, 24 June, SAPS urged consumers to carry as little cash as possible to avoid being victims of robberies. “Consider the convenience of paying your accounts electronically (consult your bank to find out about other options). Consider making use of cellphone banking, internet transfers or ATMs to do your banking,” the statement read. Small businesses have also been urged to remain cautious of robberies during these busy times. SAPS shared the following tips to help them avoid falling victim: 1. Never make your bank visits public. 2. Do not openly display the money you are depositing while standing in the bank queue. 3. Avoid carrying money bags. 4. If the money you regularly deposit grows, consider using the services of a cash management company. 5. Avoid paying your employees in public; rather use bank services. 6. Avoid driving to the bank in your company branded car.
