LAST month, one of the children wrote in his diary about his family being at a funeral with scores of people. But nobody knew that the same funeral would be his, together with his two brothers. The message from his diary was read out by a teacher to hundreds of mourners, who had gathered at their memorial service at the Ratanda Multipurpose Hall. His grandfather and the rest of the family looked sad as the message was being read. To them, it was a stark reminder that they would never see the three siblings again. The brothers died on Thursday, 26 May, after allegedly being given a poisonous energy drink by their father. He was in hospital after attempting suicide under police guard, and facing charges of murder and attempted murder. Teachers spoke about how respectful the kids were, and also shared on the pressure of dealing with sick children and being in classrooms at the same time. “We are not trained to deal with emergencies. We wish the department could organise nurses to deal with such situations. We are hurt because we could not save him and his brothers,” said one teacher. Pupils from various schools came to remember their fellow pupils. And those who knew them said they were heartbroken by the tragedy. “What happened to our friends is something we don’t wish upon anyone. They had dreams to fulfil in adulthood, but never got the chance,” said one pupil. The funeral of the three brothers will be held on Saturday, 4 June.
