LIMPOPO premier Stan Mathabatha has been re-elected as ANC
chairman at the party’s provincial 10th elective conference in a clean sweep
and emphatic victory announced on Saturday June 4. His slate dominated by those known to be aligned to the RET
faction, by an average of 300 votes margin with his deputy Florence Radzilana
retaining her position as his deputy and Bisokop Makamu retained his position
as deputy provincial secretary. Making her debut to the provincial top five was former Peter
Mokaba regional secretary Nakedi Kekana who was elected treasurer. The biggest
loser was former Soviet Lekganyane who was beaten to the position by Reuben
Madadzhe. Limpopo so far has become the first province two have two
females in the top five. READ: All systems go for ANC Limpopo elective conference Mathabatha at an impromptu press briefing after being
re-elected was quick to promise to reach out to the losing candidates to plan
the way forward for the province as rumours spread that he and Dickson Masemola
who he beat to the position of provincial chairmanship have fallen out. “I have said that after the conference we will all sit down
with those comrades to plan the way forward. I have been friends with comrade
Dickson and comrade Soviet, we are comrades,” Mathabatha told reporters. Earlier in his acceptance speech to the delegates,
Mathabatha said that now that the conference has elected its preferred
leadership the province should rally behind those who had been elected. “Once delegates take a decision and say we want this
leadership to take a baton we must rally behind them. When we got into this
conference, it was not about us but it’s about a mandate we represent “I want to commit to this leadership, those comrades who
were contesting, have not lost because it is not about individuals,” he said.
