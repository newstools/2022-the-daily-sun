IT WAS at about 2am when Nomvula woke up because she needed to pee – and it saved her life and the life of her daughter! Nomvula Mbatha (34) from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun they’re grateful to be alive even though they’ve lost everything. She said it was in the early hours of the morning on 4 June when she was really pressed and when she woke up, she was shocked by the fire that was approaching her bed. She had enough time to grab her daughter and leave the house and called for help. Her uncle was in one of the back rooms but he didn’t hear her shouting. Neighbours came and assisted in putting out the fire even though everything had already been destroyed. “Firefighters took their time to arrive and by the time they got here, neighbours had already put out the fire,” she said. Nomvula said she was still traumatised by that fire and grateful that they’re still alive. “I’m still alive by God’s Grace because me and my daughter escaped what seemed to be impossible to survive,” said Nomvula. She’s asking SunReaders to help her as she’s unemployed and now has to start afresh. “I worked really hard to buy furniture for our home. I saved up a lot because I used to do temporary jobs only to see it all go up in flames,” she said. Ekurhuleni EMS spokesman William Ntladi said the cause of fire was unknown and still being investigated. He confirmed that no one was injured. Makhi, Pontso Sefolosha said she heard Nomvula scream for help and when they went outside, they saw the fire. She said her husband then pulled out a hose pipe and helped put out the fire. “Unfortunately, at the time, everything had already been destroyed. They really need help and I hope Sun readers will come through,” said Pontso.
