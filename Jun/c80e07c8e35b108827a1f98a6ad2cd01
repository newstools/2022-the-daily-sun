A 35-YEAR-OLD man was recently sentenced to three life sentences by the Pietermaritzburg Sexual Court for raping minors. According to Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo, it is alleged that on 11 June 2021, a seven-year-old victim was at her homestead at KwaKhetha in Impendle when her uncle raped her. “She informed the family that her uncle abused her when there was no one at home. The case was reported to Impendle police and the docket was transferred to the Howick Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. The accused was arrested and was remanded in custody until his sentencing,” said Ngcobo in a statement.
