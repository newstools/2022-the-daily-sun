SIX people appeared before the Rustenburg Magistrates Court on Monday, 13 June. The three men and women face charges of contravening the Sexual Offences Act and crimen injuria. They were granted R2 000 bail each and will appear again in court on Thursday, 18 August. The group was arrested at a house used as a church in Sondela Phase 1, Rustenburg, on Friday, 3 June., following a tip-off. The men and women were all naked at the time of the arrest, except for a 34-year-old female pastor. The congregants said they were instructed by the pastor to take off their clothes as she had a vision that Jesus was coming back. Six boys and five girls, aged between four and 12, were removed from the house and handed to social workers. They were found with 11 children , who were also naked. The house was partially burnt after a couch and other items were allegedly set alight by the church leader. An angry community member said: Our neighbours were left for days without food and they were locked in a so-called church. I don’t think the pastor is mentally stable. “We will not welcome them back into our community. The law must deal with them.”
