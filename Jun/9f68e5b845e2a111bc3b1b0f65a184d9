JOHANNES Moloi said he wants his mlungu boss to pay for kidnapping and assaulting him. The 40-year-old mechanic from Winterveld, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he was accused of stealing a car engine from his place of work and was beaten, leaving him with a broken arm. He said he opened a case against his boss but it didn’t look like the cops were investigating. “I was taken to Soweto to be assaulted for the whole night while a gun was pointed at me,” he said. “That left me traumatised. It happened a few months ago but I still don’t know how to cope.” Johannes said his employer and his family beat him. “I kept telling them I didn’t take the engine but they kept punching me. My body was full of bruises and when I went to the clinic the next day, I realised my arm was broken,” he said. Johannes said the police called him to say they were going to arrest his boss but when he got to the station, their story changed. “The engine was later traced to Soshanguve and the people who bought it told them my other colleague was the one who sold it to them,” he said. The SunTeam contacted Johannes’ employer, who gave his name as Ali Mohammed and he admitted to assaulting him. “I’m not going to lie and say I didn’t beat him. I was forced to do so because I knew he stole my engine. He took the engine, which is worth R60 000 and sold it for R3 000,” he claimed. Police spokeswoman Captain Augustinah Selepe said a case of assault was opened and that no arrests had been made.
