ORLANDO Pirates’ next coach should be someone with a strong personality and a winning mindset. This is according to Bucs stalwart Teboho Moloi, who insists former Bafana Bafana and Pirates striker Benni McCarthy is that man. Moloi, who worked with McCarthy when the former Bafana star joined Bucs in 2011 as a player, is convinced that he is the right man to take the club forward. McCarthy helped Pirates win the treble in his first season back in Mzansi, with his winning mentality and leadership skills impressing then assistant coach Moloi. The former Porto and Blackburn Rovers star has since carved out a career as one of the most prominent coaches in the PSL, something that was inevitable according to Moloi. Moloi reckons McCarthy would be the ideal candidate to replace underperforming co-coaches Mandla Ncikazi and recently sacked Fadlu Davids at Pirates. “Benni has played for the team and understands the magnitude that comes with wearing the jersey,” said Moloi. “He has done very well and is one of the best players ever in South Africa. He came in at a time when Pirates really needed to defend the treble, and he did well. “For him to get a chance as coach he might come up with the right things and the right formula and talk to the players and make them understand what it takes to wear the Pirates jersey. “If he is given a chance, I can put my head on the block and say he will be the right guy to get the team back to winning ways. When I was coaching Benni, I would say to him ‘if we don’t lose…’ and before I could finish my sentence he would say ‘don’t say that, there is no lose in my vocabulary’. He wanted to talk of positivity, no negativity, to say ‘if we win’. “Benni is a winner and Pirates need people like him, to get the players that in every game when you pull on the jersey you have to be positive you are going to win.”
