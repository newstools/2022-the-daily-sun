SOWETO was brought to a standstill by gatvol residents on Monday, 20 June. Some protesters said they had been without power for months. Others said they wanted Eskom to fix aging infrastructure that caused blackouts. Chris Hani Road in Pimville and some streets in Jabulani were blocked with rocks, preventing private cars and taxis from accessing the streets. Police remained on high alert throughout the day, dispersing protesters. Rea Vaya buses, which ferry thousands of commuters in and out of Soweto daily, were also disrupted. Lucy Mohapi (60) from Pimville told Daily Sun they were tired of not having electricity. “Eskom doesn’t want to change the transformers. These transformers are old. They malfunction, leak and switch off unexpectedly,” she said. Dinny Mokoena (63), also from Pimville, said a whole section had been without electricity for three months. Joburg Metro police spokesman Xolani Fihla said no arrests were made but police were monitoring the affected areas. Eskom Gauteng spokeswoman, Amanda Qithi, said: “There is high failure of electrical equipment in Soweto. The failure is due to customers not paying for the electricity they use, buying from illegal vendors, meter bypassing and illegal connections. As a result, we have a huge backlog of transformers and mini-subs.”
