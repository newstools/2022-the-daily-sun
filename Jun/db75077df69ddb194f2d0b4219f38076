LEGENDARY Mzansi top duo Shwi NoMtekhala has officially parted ways and members have started their separate projects following fights over management. The Ngafa hitmakers, who made history in 2004 by selling more than 750 000 copies, failed to resolve issues after 22 years in music. Shwi is preparing to drop his EP Imvelo kamdali on Friday, 1 July, calling himself Shwi Mantombazane. Mtekhala has formed the trio Mtekhala ft. Maqatha noDogzin and released an EP titled Imiyalezo. Mtekhala, real name Zwelenduna Magubane, told Daily Sun he noticed it was finally over for the duo when many mediations failed. “I don’t have bad blood with Shwi and can still work with him. But only if I get answers about why they allowed the manager to use another company to sell our music when we have our own. “I loved our duo and tried to save it, but it’s clear it’s finally over. I’ve moved on, formed the trio and released the EP.” ALSO READ: Khanyi Mbau's past catches up with her! Mtekhala said he felt many people were taking Shwi’s side. “One day, people will know the truth about the split because all I wanted was the truth. It is painful that I have been painted as the cause.” Shwi, real name Mandla Xaba, said did not want to comment. “I’m focusing on my new project. It is better to move on because I was alive before the duo and will still be alive even if it’s not there,” he said. Their squabbles started last year after releasing the new album, Wangikhulisa Umama, when Mtekhala questioned the manner in which manager Bongani Manyathi handled business. Shwi sided with Bongani and Mtekhala. Other dancers stepped back, saying they would return when he was fired. Bongani said he was hurt the duo finally split after he brought it back. “We tried to resolve issues and involved families to mediate, but it was bad.”
