MEMBERS of the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa) embarked on a strike outside the Impala Platinum Mine on Monday, 20 June. According to the union and workers who were picketing outside the mine in Rustenburg, North West, they were angry that the union was not recognised by the mine. The union is not recognised because workers are not directly employed by the mine, which has a contract with outside companies to supply labour. The striking workers accused their employers of underpaying them and refusing them the right to be represented by the union. Worker Richard Tshivuri said they were tired of working hard for very little money. “We came here to make money and support our families, which is difficult because our salaries are too low,” he said. Enoch Manyoni, an official from Numsa’s head office, said they would not back down until their demands were met. Manyoni said they demanded recognition of Numsa, a salary adjustment, medical aid and a living-out allowance. The mine’s corporate affairs executive Johan Theron said they were deeply concerned. “We’re working with all affected parties in order to secure a legal and sustainable resolution as best as we can,” he said.
