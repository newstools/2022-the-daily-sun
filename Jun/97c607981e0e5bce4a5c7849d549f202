FOR some time, the church services went well until the pastor locked them in the house and told them to strip naked! It was only after residents became worried as their neighbours weren’t coming home that they went to the pastor’s house in Sondela near Rustenburg – and found naked people. Church member Celia Govo (42) said they were instructed by the pastor to take off their clothes. “The pastor told us she had a vision that Jesus Christ was coming back,” she said. Celia said she had been invited by the pastor who is her neighbour. “I decided to join because I needed healing for my husband who is sick. Our children also joined,” she said. “We had normal prayers as born-again Christians for a while.” But on Wednesday, 1 June, they had an all-night prayer session and things went bad. “The pastor instructed us to remain naked as Jesus Christ was coming back. She became so aggressive that we couldn’t say no,” she said. Celia said she locked the house and told them to use buckets instead of going to the outside toilet. On Friday, 3 June, the community members suspected something was not right and called the police. North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said a case of contravening the Sexual Offences Act has been opened. Mokgwabone said the pastor almost burnt down the house when she set alight some household items including a couch. The pastor has been admitted to hospital for psychological evaluation while a congregant was hospitalised for medical attention.
