Over the past couple days, the People’s Paper published many letters about June 16 and what it means to our country. Many of our letter writers implored the youth to treat June 16 as a day of reverence and to refrain from partying the day away with booze and drugs. The truth of the matter is quite simple. Considering the way the youth have been abandoned by the government, who have spent the better part of the last decade and a half stuffing their pockets full of public money meant to empower the lives of the youth, it’s not surprising Mzansi’s youngsters are on a mission to obliterate themselves from existence. Besides, young men and women in our country are actively avoided when it comes to politics, which is dominated by ageing dinosaurs trundling around trying to ensure their own longevity and fill their plates with food. This is where the events of June 16 may actually have relevance. No matter which sad party tries to hijack the festivities and claim the day for themselves, the youth of 1976 didn’t need leaders or politicians to tell them they were gatvol. They got it together themselves, and some paid the ultimate sacrifice. So yes, the People’s Paper agrees with our esteemed letter writers. To our children – the time for drinking and drugging is over. This is your time. No one is going to give you hand-outs and if they do, it’ll be for a vote. Make your own path, find your own heroes. There is no better time than now.
