THIS week’s episode of media personality Somizi Mhlongo’s reality show Living The Dream with Somizi had everyone eager to hear his side of the story. They wanted to hear what he had to say regarding the allegations made about him by his ex-husband Mohale Motaung, after audio clips between Mohale and producers of Somizi’s reality TV show were leaked. The episode has left viewers unimpressed with his constant jabs at Mohale. During the episode, Somizi mentioned that this was his first time listening to the audio. “I never had the time and was not interested in listening to that audio, so this is my first time listening to it,” he said. He then said he was 5% shocked about what was said in the audio, but he wasn’t shocked about who was saying all those things. He then slammed Mohale for wanting 50% of his estate, saying he won’t get a cent from him, and that what he is trying to do to him is a “money heist”.

Lol, like is that your content?” Sego_R commented: “Baby!! This is my chat. He is so weird for this. I even detest that he has a whole show to discredit Mohale. I also can’t believe there’s people that religiously watch his show.” In the midst of all the negative tweet, some tweeps defended Somizi, saying that he is allowed to tell his side of the story in peace. Dodo @Swinkwi tweeted: “Somizi has the right to tell his side of the story. He’s been quiet and didn’t start dishing up, so please give us a break.”
