 A HEATWAVE and fires are badly damaging Tunisia’s grain harvest, leading the farmers union to forecast that output will fall well short of government hopes. Loss of grain production comes as the country struggles with food importation costs. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister Mhamoud Elyess Hamza forecasted that the 2022 grain harvest in the country would reach 1,8 million tonnes. But farmers union official Mohamed Rejaibia, pointing to fires that began raging over much of the country last month, said that was no longer possible. “The grain harvest will not be more than 1,4 million tonnes,” said Rejaibia. Tunisia has been counting on a big crop to reduce grain imports amid a national financial crisis that is exacerbated by the war. Higher prices of imported food and energy will cost the budget $1.7 billion this year, says the government, which subsidises such supplies. , a member of the union’s executive office. “Some of it will be lost to fires and some perhaps during collection.” – REUTERS
