RESIDENTS of Masoyi, Mpumalanga, were outraged as the five people accused of killing six-year-old Bontle Mashiyane made their second appearance in the Kabokweni Magistrates Court on Friday, 24 June. Collen Hlongwane (36), Ntombikayise Ngwenya (40), Thapelo Ngomane (25), Samuel Tsela (64) and Philasande Tsela (28) are facing charges of rape, murder and kidnapping. And included in them were Mashiyane’s two neighbours, a parolee and inyanga together with his son. They are accused of conspiring to kidnap Mashiyane in April. Her mutilated body was found dumped not far from home three weeks after she was reported missing. It is alleged that she was killed for muthi purposes. The little girl was laid to rest early this month, with some of her body parts still missing. Hlongwane, Ngwenya and Ngomane abandoned bail while the remaining two appointed a legal representative. Resident Nokuthula Maphanga told Daily Sun that if cops did not know what to do with the suspects, they must release them to the community. “We are very angry as a community. The police must give us these suspects since we know what to do with them. The court will keep on postponing the case, wasting our time. They must release them to us so we can deal with them,” she said. Another resident said: “We cannot allow dangerous people in our communities. We want the two masterminds jailed for life. If the justice system is failing, they must give them to us so we can finish them off,” she said. The case was postponed to 2 August for further investigations. Mashiyane’s aunt said: “If it’s being postponed for the state to get more evidence for them to be jailed, we are okay but eventually, the truth will come out. In the end, we want closure and justice to prevail.”
