FORMER Uzalo actor Sifiso Simamane has started a casting agency. The agency is called STK Casting Agency and it was opened two months ago. It is based in Durban but it is able to locate talent anywhere in the country. “In my acting career, I’ve been approached by a lot of people asking me to help them. Unfortunately, I couldn’t help them due to my hectic schedule,” he said “Now that I am more experienced and knowledgeable, I have decided to start this agency. “The purpose of STK Casting Agency is to unearth and groom raw talent.” Sifiso said his casting agency had no joining fee. “Instead, we concentrate on finding jobs for creative practitioners and upon negotiations, we take a certain percentage. We also ensure the rights of an artist are protected,” he said. The casting agency deals with actors, dancers, voice-over artists and people who want role in theatre production, among other things. He said he was not necessarily concerned about age as long as there was talent. “The casting agency is open to elderly people as well as those who live with disabilities. In most cases, these people feel excluded by the industry,” he said.
