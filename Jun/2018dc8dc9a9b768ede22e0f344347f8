CORRUPTION Watch says the release of the final state capture inquiry report signalled an “important milestone” in the country’s attempts to come to terms with the impact of state capture. It said the time, money and energy spent over the past three years should not be in vain. Chief Justice Raymond Zondo handed over the final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday, 22 June. In a statement, Corruption Watch said the report must be followed by “... concrete processes that set in motion appropriate investigations by law enforcement agencies into the actions of the vast array of people and institutions allegedly involved in the complex network of graft and patronage, as heard in evidence that assailed the country over the last four and a half years”. Karam Singh, executive director of Corruption Watch, lauded the commission as one of the “most significant” the country had ever seen.
