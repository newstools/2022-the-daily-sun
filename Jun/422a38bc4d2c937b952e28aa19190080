CAPE Town Spurs coach Shaun Bartlett hopes Richards Bay retain their mentor Pitso Dladla after he won them promotion to the DStv Premiership last season. However, Bartlett said if Dladla stays in charge of Bay, winning games from the start of the new season will be crucial. But Bay boss Sifiso Biyela said Dladla is going nowhere, although he said there will be conditions, provided the team is not relegated to the Championship in their first season in the top flight. Bartlett knows the pain of guiding a club to the top flight and then being shown the door the next day. After Golden Arrows were relegated to the GladAfrica Championship at the end of the 2013-14 season, Abafana Bes’Thende chairperson Mato Madlala put her trust in Bartlett to bring the club back to the Premiership. Bartlett succeeded in the 2014-15 season but was sacked by Madlala before the following season started. Madlala replaced Bartlett by bringing in former Bafana Bafana assistant coach and ex-Safa Technical Director Serame Letsoaka to lead the side in the Premiership. “It was great achievement [by Dladla] and next season it will be about finding consistency,” said Bartlett. “And they did show over the last season that they do things well. Hopefully, he [Dladla] gets an opportunity to continue. “Obviously, he got the team to the top flight and needs to be given a chance t show what he is capable of.” Consistency is what Dladla was able to get right last season in the Championship. After earning four points in the opening five matches, the Natal Rich Boyz went on a successful drive, going 19 matches unbeaten before losing to the University of Pretoria. Meanwhile, Bartlett said his side will be stronger in the next season and will compete to gain promotion to the Premiership.
