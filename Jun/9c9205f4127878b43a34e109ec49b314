Two men have been busted during a high-speed chase with cops
in Cape Town after they allegedly shot dead two people in a cellular shop this
afternoon. Cops, including a helicopter, chased the vehicle in which
the suspects were driving in and busted two suspects on a high-speed chase. A Daily Sun source who witnessed the incident said it was
like there was a movie that was being filed. “It was those kinds of chases that
we see on TV in movies. I saw the cops chasing the vehicle while I was going
the opposite direction but when I was coming back I saw the criminals lying
down on their stomachs after they were bust,” said SunTeam’s source who works
in the area. It is not clear whether the incident was a robbery or the
suspects wanted the two men dead. According to the men who spoke to SunTeam,
the shooters did not take any phones but they just shot and fled the scene. Cops spokesman Sergeant Wesley Twigg confirmed the incident.
“The circumstances surrounding a shooting incident Tuesday afternoon at a
Cellular shop in Van Riebeeck Road, Kuilsriver, where two foreign nationals
were shot and fatally wounded are under investigation. According to reports two
unknown suspects entered the shop and shot the two victims. The victims were
declared deceased on the scene by medical personnel,” said Twigg. Cops from Kuilsriver cop shop have opened a double murder
case for investigation. Twigg said detectives are currently questioning two
people that could possibly be linked to the crime.
