AFTER former president Jacob Zuma suffered another legal setback in his battle with state prosecutor Billy Downer last Thursday, his supporters are set to host a solidarity prayer to ask for God’s intervention. The prayer will take place at Zuma’s homestead in KwaDakwadunuse in Nkandla, northern KZN, on Thursday, 2 June. His supporters said the prayer was meant to show him spiritual support as he faced persecution by law, and show his enemies that he was not alone. Last week Justice Mandisa Maya, president of the Supreme Court of Appeal, dismissed Zuma’s reconsideration application. He was trying to get Downer off as the lead prosecutor in his arms deal trial, alleging that he contaminated the case by leaking information to American spies and selected South African journalists. Zuma’s loyalist Bishop Vusi Dube said: “The purpose of the prayer is to stand in solidarity during the time of persecution by law. A man who, in his own life, fought to liberate us from draconian law, today is being punished for leading us into the promised land. It is a warning to those who think Msholozi is standing in isolation as he appears in court. Let the system know that Msholozi is, and still is, the best president we ever had.” Another loyalist Mdu Nkambule, one of the leaders of My President Group that is known for idolising and supporting Zuma, said they would be part of the prayer. “We are organising it to give strength to Zuma as he is faced with many court appearances and judgments,” he said. The prayer comes almost two weeks after the newly elected Zuma regional leadership in Musa Dladla region visited him to pledge support. Last month, the Pietermaritzburg High Court postponed Zuma’s corruption trial to 1 August to allow him to pursue an application with the Supreme Court of Appeal. And should there be no further legal problems, trial will start from 15 August to September.
