POULTRY farmer David Dlamini sells chickens to izangoma – and he feeds them termites which he goes to the bush to harvest. “The chickens are healthy and fresh,” said the farmer from Duduza near Nigel in Ekurhuleni. He said termites have proteins and make his chickens grow and breed faster. “Izangoma prefer inyongo from the chickens and the chickens are believed to be pure and can be used to connect a person with his own idlozi.” ALSO READ | Three kids die after ‘eating poisoned food meant
for rats’ Feeding chickens with termites is done around the world. Farmers in countries such as India and Burkina Faso fill pots with old sacks, dried crop stubble and dried cow dung. They add water and the pot is placed upside down in the field and in no time termites will start filling it up. David just goes to the bush to look for mounds which he collects. When he gets to his farm he breaks the mounds into pieces to release termites. ALSO READ | Senior journalist turned Shakes Mashaba’s taxi
