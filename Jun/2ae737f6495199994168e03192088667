KING Misuzulu kaZwelithini and the Zulu nation marked the end of the mourning period for the late King Goodwill Zwelithini. King Misuzulu performed a two-day cleansing ceremony for his father at KwaKhangelamankengane Royal Palace. This after he didn’t attend a ceremony performed by royal family members who opposed him as king. On Saturday, 25 June, Misuzulu and Amabutho hunted wild animals and washed Zwelithini’s weapons (spears, sticks, and shield) to make them available to Misuzulu to use as king. On Sunday, 26 June, the king joined by Amabutho, went to the cattle kraal, where he sang royal hymns to tell their ancestors that they are officially ending the mourning period. The faction opposing him including Zwelithini’s four wives and some of their children didn’t attend the ceremony, saying they would not attend as they already had one. Only Zwelithini’s last wife, Queen Zola Mafu attended alongside Zulu Monarch Traditional Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, KZN House of Traditional Leaders chairman Inkosi Phathisizwe Chiliza and KZN Co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka, among other guests. Buthelezi said the dark cloud that was hanging over the Zulu nation had been lifted as the king had performed the cleansing ceremony. He said the hunt was successful and Misuzulu distinguished himself as a good marksman. “After he came back with animals, we sung the sacred royal house hymns and hunting songs and after that the king had a sip of our beer,” he said. Amabutho member Zwelenduna Ndwandwe said they were happy the mourning period had ended. Royal family members who performed the cleansing ceremony are preparing to do a ritual called umkhuphulo, where they’ll unite Zwelithini’s spirit with his ancestors.
