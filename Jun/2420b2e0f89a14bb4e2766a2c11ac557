PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has described the state capture era as “a different kind of national trauma”. Writing in his weekly newsletter on Monday, 27 June, Ramaphosa said its damage went beyond the looting of the public purse, the attempted destruction of public institutions and the grand corruption that robbed the South African people of what was rightfully theirs. “It was also a betrayal of the values of our Constitution and the principles upon which our democracy was founded,” he said. Ramaphosa received the State Capture Commission’s final report last week. He said the work of the commission was made possible by South Africans who acted as whistle-blowers, uncovered, reported on wrongdoing, made submissions and gave evidence. Ramaphosa said: “The immoral, unethical and criminal behaviour of self-serving individuals in positions of authority undermined the confidence of the people in the leaders and institutions that are meant to serve them. “This has created a trust gap that will take some time to close.” He reminded Mzansi that with the Covid-19 restrictions lifted, the responsibility for preventing a resurgence of the disease now rests with each and every citizen because the pandemic was not over. “It requires that we act sensibly, understand the risks and do what we can to minimise them,” he said. He said the decision to lift the remaining restrictions was made because of a decline in the daily cases, hospitalisations and reported deaths. “The heroism of every South African has enabled us to weather the storm. “And it is the same resilience and fortitude that will enable us to forge ahead with the difficult task of reconstruction and recovery,” said Ramaphosa.
