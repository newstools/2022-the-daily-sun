THE Gauteng community safety and correctional services departments hosted a School Safety Social Crime Prevention Programme at the Joburg Correctional Centre on Sunday, 19 June. About 50 pupils from schools around Joburg attended the programme. Inmates shared stories of how they succumbed to peer pressure and how it led to crime. Lerato Thinane (23) is serving a 20-year sentence for killing his mum. “Prison is not nice. I was just 18 years when I came here. We make mistakes and we learn from them,” he said. Another inmate, Dibuseng Mokgadi (32), said: “I was 25 years old when I was arrested for murder. I wanted to fit in and ended up selling drugs because I wanted a nice life.” Gauteng community safety’s head of department Nontsikelelo Sisulu said they hoped the programme would deter young people who were already in conflict with the law. Sisulu said they hoped it would help curb violence in schools.
