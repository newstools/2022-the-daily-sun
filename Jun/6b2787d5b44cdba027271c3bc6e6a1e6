BAFANA Bafana assistant coach Helman Mkhalele says he is going to have a migraine trying to select his final squad on Thursday that will represent Mzansi in the Cosafa cup. Bafana assembled for camp in Johannesburg on Monday ahead of the 2022 Cosafa Cup in Durban. The South Africans will be coached by Bafana assistant Mkhalele as Under-23 coach David Notoane was dropped. The 30-player preliminary squad will be cut down before the team departs for Durban. This year the SA Football Association (Safa) took the decision that the SA U-23 team should take part in Cosafa. The Olympic side has not played a game since the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, last year in July. “I am happy with how our first training session went (on Tuesday) and I’m also happy with both the attitude and the work ethic they gave, given the fact that most of them are just a day or two into their pre-season training with their respective teams,” said Mkhalele. “Each game we play as Bafana Bafana, we play with the intention of winning it,” Mkhalele added. “We have assembled this young group, mostly comprising of Under-23 players because we are also building for the future. There’s the AFCON qualifiers we need to be ready for in the upcoming few months, and the Under-23 2024 Olympic Games qualifiers we need to start preparing and building towards now and not a few weeks prior, for example.” Mzansi will start the competitions in the quarterfinals where they will face Mozambique on 13 July. SA won last year’s Cosafa Cup in Gqeberha under coach Morena Ramoreboli, who was called in to replace Mkhalele at the eleventh hour. Mkhalele had tested positive for Covid-19.
