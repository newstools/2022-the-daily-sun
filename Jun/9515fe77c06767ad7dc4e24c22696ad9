GOSPEL singer Dr Tumi will not dump music to be a full-time medical doctor. He told Daily Sun singing was his calling and God wanted him to minister through music. Dr Tumi, whose real name is Tumisang Makweya, has chosen to limit his work in medicine to focus on singing. He said he had been practising medicine since 2008. “I am focusing on music right now. I will not be doing medicine full-time. That will not be happening. I am doing what God wants me to do,” he told Daily Sun. He said he had travelled all over because of music. “I am happy with it. I believe it is doing God’s will and that’s all I care about,” he said. ALSO READ: Mohale Motaung finally breaks his silence!
