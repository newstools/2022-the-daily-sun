FORMER Emalahleni councillor Linda Bhekiyise
Goqo (57) and accomplices Xolani Manana (32) and Sharon Mtshali (36) arrested
for alleged fraud, theft and illegally selling RDP houses meant for the poor. They were all released on bail by the Witbank
Magistrate court on Friday , 03 June 2022  after they were arrested by the
Hawks Middelburg based Serious Corruption Investigation the same day
for fraud, theft and corruption. Their arrest followed an investigation by the
Hawks which started in July 2020 whereby complainants reported to the police
that they paid money to buy RDP houses which were never allocated to them. Hawks
spokeswoman Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi said, “During the investigation, it was established
that the Emalahleni Local Municipality Councillor Goqo received the money for
his own benefit. It was further established that he was working together with
Xolani Manana who was sent by the Councillor to collect monies that he charged
people for the RDP houses. “The councillor did not want electronic
transactions, he preferred cash only hence Xolani was tasked to collect the
monies.” Sekgotodi said during the interview Manana
made a confession on six incidences whereby he received the money from the
victims and gave it to the councillor which was cash only. Accused number three
Mtshali was also linked after her account  number was used to receive the
money from one of the victims which she withdrew then handed to the councillor
and total money stolen was R307 000.00. During their first court appearance in Witbank
Magistrate Court on Friday, they were released on R2000 bail each and warned to
return to court on 26 July 2022 for further investigation.
