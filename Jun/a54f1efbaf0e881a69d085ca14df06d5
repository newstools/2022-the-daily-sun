SOME parts of Soweto are without water. This came after a decision by Joburg Water to isolate specific reservoirs and sewer network points to assist in the search for Khayalethu Magadla. The six-year-old fell into a manhole in Dlamini on the 12 June. On Monday, 20 June, Khayalethu would have turned seven years old. On his birthday, children from his school went to his home to sing and cut cake for him – in his absence. Khayalethu’s father Kholeka Magadla made an impassioned plea to rescue personnel and technicians searching for his son not to give up. The City of Joburg’s Emergency Services (EMS) personnel had been on the ground every day trying every rescue technique at their disposal. Spokesman Robert Mulaudzi told Daily Sun that they’d located all the manholes along the pipeline that Khayalethu fell in. “These manholes are flowing towards the Split Chamber which is in Olifantsvlei Cementry in Eldorado Park. We’re also deploying a floating device which is a boat attached with under water camera and camera on top along the pipeline, which will give us a 360 view of the pipeline,” said Mulaudzi. He emphasised that the city wouldn’t rest until the boy was found. He also said no matter how ambitious they were, they also needed to ensure that everyone was safe during this search. “Safety of rescuers is very important in operations like these. That’s why rescuers are thoroughly briefed before entering the pipeline to ensure that they are safe at all times,” he said.
