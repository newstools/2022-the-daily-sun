KARABO Motsoeneng (19) is excited to be representing Mzansi in August at the World Athletics U20 Championships Cali 22 in Colombia. The long distance athlete from Hammanskraal, Tshwane, has seen a rapid rise on the local running scene over the last two years and has raked in national and regional titles. She now has her sights set on higher honours at international level. Karabo’s ambitions got a boost after the Spar Women’s Challenge Tshwane pledged their support for her that will assist her to prepare for competitions. “I thank Spar and Asics for putting their faith in me and letting me make the best of my opportunities. “I am proud to say I am ready to show the world my God-given talent.” In April, the matriculant won national junior titles in the 3 000m and 5 000m in Potchefstroom, North West. She stepped onto the podium after only her second 10km race at the Spar Women’s Challenge in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape, where she finished second. Karabo is hoping to win the second 10km race of the Grand Prix series in Durban on Sunday, 26 June. Karabo grew up without parents in the Free State before she was discovered and offered a bursary at Prestige College. She has used her running talent to rise above her challenges and build a bright future. Her courage speaks to the #iRISE theme of this year’s Women’s Virtual Challenge celebrating women who rise above challenges through perseverance. Organiser Retha Ingenbleek said: “We are proud to be associated with Karabo. “She has touched so many through her endearing spirit. We believe she will continue her incredible rise with the help of a caring community.”
