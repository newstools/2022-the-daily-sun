The South African Defence Force nabbed four stolen cars about to be taken out of the country early on Tuesday, 14 June. The two Toyota Legend 50 bakkies, a Fortuner and a Hilux were heading to Mozambique. The vehicles were cut off at the South African border. The occupants started shooting at the SANDF when they were stopped. When the SANDF retaliated, one of the occupants was shot dead and the others disappeared into the darkness. The vehicles were reported stolen at Lyttelton in Tshwane, Florida west of Joburg and in Pienaar, Mpumalanga. Colonel Athlenda Mathe confirmed the recovery of the cars and said SANDF has to comment further. The deceased has not been identified yet and police are investigating.
