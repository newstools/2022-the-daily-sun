A stolen car that was allegedly meant to be sold in Umhlanga
on Friday, 24 June was tracked down. Cops continued to the location for observation with the
assistance of other role players. According to spokeswoman constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo, two men
who were planning to sell the car were spotted waiting for the buyer. “The police officers approached the men and enquired about
the car. They failed to provide the police with a response. The suspects aged
between 22 and 24 were arrested for theft after being found in possession of
the stolen car. They were both detained at Durban North SAPS,” Ngcobo said. An initial investigation revealed that the car was wanted on
a Wierdabrug case. It was revealed that the car was registered in the name of a
person who died in 2020 but it was only registered in May 2022. An additional count of fraud was added to the charges
against the suspects. The 22-year-old suspect was linked to two cases of business
robbery and theft opened in Gauteng. Ngcobo said they will be handed over to Gauteng police for
further profiling, his accomplice will appear before the Durban Magistrates
Court on Monday, 27 June.
