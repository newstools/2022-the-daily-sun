SQUATTER camps are crime hotspots. The kids have fewer facilities to keep them busy and as they grow up, they end up being attracted to a life of crime because they have nothing to do. To wrap up youth month, Springs police held games over the weekend to keep young people busy. Police and residents came together to play soccer, netball and do a fun walk. Station commander Brigadier Thembeka Gwebushe said they want residents to know that police are not only about arresting criminals. It was a fun day despite the cold. Gwebushe was leading from the front in teaching the youth about drugs and gender-based violence related crimes, along with social crime. Gwebushe was joined by members of the social crime and communications units of the police, the Department of Community Safety, Community Policing Forum and Springs Police Station’s youth desk. “It started with a fun run/walk by the community and SAPS members followed by other sports,” said spokesman Sergeant Themba Tshabalala. After a netball match, the station commander handed netball balls to the teams. Later, she handed out soccer balls and jerseys to community teams that took part. Senior teams were also given soccer kits by the station commander. Police appealed to the community to work with the police to eradicate crime in the area.
