RESIDENTS of Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, torched the shack belonging to a man accused of raping a 13-year-old girl on Friday, 24 June. They told Daily Sun they were sick and tired of people doing as they please in their kasi. They also accused the police of dragging their feet in attending to such matters. On Saturday, 25 June, the residents went looking for the man, but he had already fled his shack. They razed the shack and vowed to look for and bring him to book. A 42-year-old mum said she lived in fear because of how rape was always the talk of town ekasi. “I have two girls and don’t want them to live among rapists. We hope this will also be a warning to others,” said the mum. A 38-year-old man said such men gave all men a terrible name. He said he was proud of how the community dealt with this matter as it would send a strong message to would-be rapists. “To end this crime in our community, it must start with men. We must be intolerant of such nonsense. It needs to stop. If it means burning those shacks one by one, so be it,” he said. Another concerned mum (46) said she had four girls and would do anything to protect them. She said not so long ago, her sister’s child told her an old man forced her to have a conversation with him. “From there, she’ll be dragged into his shack. We won’t tolerate this at all,” she said. The family has opened a case at Daveyton Police Station. Cops said the matter is under investigation.
