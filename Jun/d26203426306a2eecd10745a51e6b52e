A HUGE Kwa Mai Mai fire in Joburg claimed the life of one person and left just more 1 000 people displaced. One other person is said to have been hospitalised after the fire, which burnt all the shacks down to the ground. The cause of the fire, which started on Saturday night, 11 June, just before midnight, is still unknown. But residents alleged that a woman, who had more than enough to drink, left a stove unattended. The residents also said they have not yet been able to identify the deceased person or his family as he is burnt beyond recognition. Today, 12 June, residents were seen salvaging some of the building materials they will use to rebuild their shacks. Some were seen sitting outside with their children and a few belongings they had managed to take before the fire could flatten their shacks. However, others could only save themselves and nothing else. Joburg EMS spokeswoman Nana Radebe said: “We received a call just after midnight. When we got there, the fire had engulfed the entire place. One person died, another was hospitalised.” Radebe said there were more than 400 shacks that were burnt.
