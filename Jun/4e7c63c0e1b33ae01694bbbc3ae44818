On 14 March, five people were killed in New Monwabisi Park. A week later, six people were murdered in Enkanini while drinking outside a shack. In May, there were two shootings that claimed 10 lives, while another four were killed in June. The police arrested suspects linked to the March incidents but are still investigating the more recent shootings.

For this reason, Cele handed over 12 new vehicles to the kasi’s three cop shops. Khayelitsha Development Forum chairman Ndithini Tyhido said: “I don’t want to say much but only thank you minister, for responding to our call.” Commenting on the new vans, resident Nandipha Mlungu (40), said: “Now let’s see if we are still going to be told there are no vans.”
