THE Tshwane Magistrates Court has released Brigadier Stephina Mahlangu and seven others on a bail of R3 000 each. The eight appeared in court in connection with four irregular contracts valued at more than R960 000 in the SAPS national police commissioner’s corporate services office. According to the Investigating Directorate (ID) spokeswoman, Sindisiwe Seboka, the other accused include businesspeople Kishene Chetty, Kumarases Prithiviraj, Salamina Khoza, Harry Milanzi, Abigayle Esau, and Lorette Joubert. “The contracts in question were awarded between 2014 and 2017 for the procurement of toners, educational material and digital recording systems. The group face charges of fraud, theft, corruption and forgery,” said Seboka. She said the group was over the weekend and had been kept at the Silverton Police Station in Tshwane. Head ID Advocate Andrea Johnson said that her office’s recent arrests linked to police contracts were a clear indication that no one, including any government department, would be exempt where there was proof of criminality. “The consistent hard work of the joint ID and SAPS team is commended,” she said. The matter will be back in court on 29 June for allocation in the regional court.
