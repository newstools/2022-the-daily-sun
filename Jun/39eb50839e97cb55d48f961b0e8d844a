TSHEPO Legasa has many questions as to how his son, Kelebogile Zondo, died at an initiation school last December. The 55-year-old from Evaton, Vaal, told Daily Sun that despite initiation not being part of their culture, Kelebogile (18) insisted on going because of peer pressure. Tshepo said the family only found out about his death at the school in Zakariyya Park, Joburg, on 31 December, the day he was supposed to return. “We told him he should not do it because it’s not part of our culture but he ran away. On the day he left, he cooked and cleaned the house. It was his way of saying goodbye,” he said.  Tshepo said he looked for Kelegobile and when he couldn’t find him, suspected he went to an illegal school. He went to open a kidnapping case but police told him Kelebogile was 18 and had a right to make his own decisions. Five weeks later, a man came to him to say he had found Kelebogile, and he wanted money and other items he needed for initiation. “I bought almost everything that was needed for his welcome back ceremony,” he said. On the day he was supposed to return, the police and a man from the school broke the news that he was dead. He was taken to a clinic, where he found his son’s body.   He said he was dirty and thin. “My son had promised to build me a dream house,” he said, adding that Kelebogile was supposed to start studying law. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo confirmed cops were investigating a case of kidnapping and another of inquest. “The investigation is almost complete; we will take the docket to court for a decision.”
