ON Sunday, 29 May, Gauteng cops issued a reward of up to R100 000 to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of a wanted criminal, Mbuso Ndabazovela Biyela. It appears someone responded to the call as Biyela was killed in the early hours of this morning, 6 June, during a shoot-out with the cops in KZN. According to Brigadier Brenda Muridili, Biyela is linked to eight cases, including the murder of a police officer that occurred in October 2021. Muridili said various law enforcement agencies approached the house where Biyela was hiding at about 3am. She said Biyela started firing shots at the police who were forced to retaliate. “Biyela was fatally wounded. None of the cops sustained injuries. The team recovered an unlicensed firearm and ammunition upon entering the house. “Biyela was previously arrested in KZN and Gauteng for murder in August 2020 and October 2021 respectively but he managed to escape from lawful custody,” Muridili said.

She said Biyela was positively linked to five cases of murder in Jabulani, Soweto, that were committed between October 2021 and March 2022. “He was further linked to a Lenasia case of hijacking in December 2017 and for possession of an unlicensed firearm, as well as an August 2020 case of murder in KZN,” Muridili said. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela thanked people who contacted the police with information. “We, as the police in Gauteng, have committed to entrenching ourselves into our communities to realise the ideal of community policing. “We made a call to anyone with information on the whereabouts of one of our most-wanted suspects and the calls that we received have assisted us a lot. “Thank you to the public as, together, we have ensured the end of Biyela’s reign of terror,” said Mawela.
