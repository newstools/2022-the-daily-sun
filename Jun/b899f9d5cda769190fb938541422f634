A GOGO appeared in the Ladybrand Magistrates Court on Thursday, 2 June, after she allegedly stabbed her nine-year-old grandson several times. The 51-year-old from Ladybrand in the Free State allegedly had a quarrel with her grandson on Monday, 30 May, which led to a physical fight. She allegedly took the knife from her grandson who, it is alleged, intended to stab her. Gogo allegedly stabbed him several times and he was admitted to a local hospital with critical wounds. He was later transferred to Pelonomi Reginal Hospital in Bloemfontein. The Commission for Gender Equality has condemned the incident. National spokesman Javu Baloyi said: “The issue at hand is that the commission doesn’t condone any violence regardless of the person, age and sex. Gender-based violence is a concern in the whole country and it worries us a lot. It seems to be a second pandemic. “You cannot use maximum force on a nine-year-old child. The boy will forever have those wounds and they will psychologically affect him. “We cannot afford to be a laughing stock to other countries due to such a senseless crime,” said Baloyi. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said the gogo was charged with attempted murder. He said she was out on R500 bail and the case was postponed to 23 June.
