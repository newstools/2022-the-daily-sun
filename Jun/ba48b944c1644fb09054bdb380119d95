A British
YouTuber with over 69,000 subscribers was sentenced to 27 months in jail for
reckless driving. Adeel Habib
(25) was behind the Certi Drivers channel, which shared videos of him
driving dangerously on public roads. According
to the BBC, videos show him driving at high speeds, racing other drivers,
weaving in and out of traffic, and ignoring red lights. Habib's
channel has since been deactivated.  Carscoops reports that West Yorkshire cops say, Habib's
driving violations occurred between December 2020 and October 2021. They discovered his channel while focusing on dangerous
driving in Leeds and West Yorkshire. This is not the 25-year-first old's run-in with the
authorities. He was sentenced to four years in prison on drugs charges
while police were investigating his driving. In addition to the 27-month
sentence, Habib has been barred from driving for 49 months.
