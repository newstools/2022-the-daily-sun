FOR the past 12 years, a man has been attacked by creatures in his house. They bother him so much, he can’t sleep. One of them now slaps him on the nose, while the other bangs on his door. The 58-year-old man from Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, said he has visited izangoma, but nothing has changed. “The creature that knocks on the door doesn’t stop. A week never passes. I can’t have peace,” he said. He said the creatures have made his life a living hell since 2010. “These creatures come into my bedroom. They wake me up, shake me and do all sorts of things to me until I lose my sleep. “I need help. I have consulted more than 20 izangoma, including prophets, but the creatures still bother me,” he said. The man said he needs a powerful sangoma who can remove these evil creatures. Traditional healer, Kuppe Banda, said agreed that  the man needs a strong sangoma who deals with such cases. “The healer must be sure of his problem because it may not end well if they are weak spiritually,” he said. Banda said it becomes more dangerous when the creatures get used to the environment – because they take control of the house.
