SLAIN Kutlwano Kasibe’s funeral is currently underway in Molapo, Soweto. Friends and family have expressed deep pain in the manner in which the 16-year-old lost his life. Kutlwano was assaulted by a mob a week ago in Mapetla, after being accused of stealing a tap. The mentally challenged teen died in hospital, and four suspects have since been arrested in connection with his murder. Following his death, residents took to their WhatsApp group, admitting to have assaulted Kutlwano and saying that the intention was to instil discipline. The matter was postponed to 7 July for bail application.
