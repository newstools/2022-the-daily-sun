THERE’S a new romance in Mzansi’s celebville! Former Rhythm City star Mapula Mafole and Afro-soul singer Phila Dlozi are head over heels in love. The two lovebirds have been using social media platforms to appreciate one another and express how they feel. In an Instagram post, Phila wrote that he appreciates the love Mapula gives him. He wrote: “Ngiyabonga sthandwa sami (thank you my love) for the love that you are showing me.” Mapula replied with heart emojis to which Phila responded: “I love you.” It seems like some fans didn’t know they are romantically involved as they seemed shocked and others congratulated them.
