THE Senzo Meyiwa trial continued on Tuesday, 7 June, with the cross-examination of state witness Sergeant Thabo Mosia. During cross-examination by defence Advocate Zandile Mshololo in the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane, Mosia admitted that a bullet found in the kitchen of the house where Meyiwa was murdered could have been planted. This was after a witness made a statement that the scene was contaminated before Mosia could collect evidence. It was revealed in court that when Mosia first arrived on the scene in the early hours of 27 October 2014, he didn’t find the bullet and it was found behind a kitchen counter the following day. Speaking about a blood swab taken from the scene, Mosia said Meyiwa was shot in the kitchen and there were signs of a scuffle. Mshololo asked why there was no blood in the kitchen but only in the living room, Mosia said it was surprising. When Mshololo asked him whether it was possible that the crime scene was cleaned, state Prosecutor George Baloyi objected, saying that was speculation. However, Mshololo went further and accused Mosia of tampering with evidence. Mosia said he did not tamper with evidence.
