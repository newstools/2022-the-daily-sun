FRIENDS, family and residents came in numbers to share their fond memories of the late Moshe Lesutu. The owner of Lesutu Pub and Grill in Zone 16, Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane, was gunned down on 18 June by three unknown men. His memorial service was held at the pub on Thursday, 23 June. Moshe was described as a fun and caring man who looked after his people. His friend and comedian, Thapelo “Shampoonizer” Seemise, said he was shattered when he heard the news, and that Moshe was the first person to give him a chance as a comedian. “My first show was here at this pub. I came here not knowing who Moshe was but when I told him I wanted to perform, he didn’t mind. Instead, he took care of me and the people I came with,” he said. Moshe’s cousin Lebo Ngobeni described him as funny and kind.  “I knew I could always rely on him. He was my brother and I feel so lost right now. To those who did this, I don’t hate you. I know that one day we will meet because nothing stays hidden forever,” she said. According to Moshe’s uncle, he was shot with eight bullets. He had gone to fetch his trousers from the tailor. While he was there, three men came from nowhere and shot at them. “He tried to defend himself, but it was too late. He drove off, but hit a wall nearby,” said the uncle. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a manhunt was launched and preliminary investigation suggested the deceased was inside a car with another man when they were shot at. “They were rushed to hospital where one was certified dead and the other is in a critical condition. A case of murder and attempted murder is investigated.”
