Rajesh and Atul Gupta have been arrested in Dubai, more than four months after Interpol issued a red notice for them in connection with fraud and money laundering charges. The brothers are wanted in connection with the R24.9 million Nulane Investment fraud and money laundering case, which will proceed in the Free State High Court in Bloemfontein in September. Two independent sources with direct knowledge of events confirmed the arrests to News24. Chrispin Phiri, spokesperson for the department of justice, told News24’s Jeff Wicks: “There is no confirmation.” It is understood that a high-level meeting of law enforcement agencies is currently taking place in Pretoria. According to News24’s information the arrests were executed by the Dubai Police’s Criminal Investigation Department of the Dubai police on Friday. The National Prosecuting Authority have yet to verify them.
