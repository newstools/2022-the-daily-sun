ORLANDO Pirates defender Kwanda Mngonyama is set to follow Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo out of the door. According to an insider, Pirates are considering letting Mngonyama go as he barely featured for the club last season. Former Bafana Bafana skipper Hlatshwayo was released last week. Mngonyama joined Pirates at the beginning of last season after leaving Maritzburg United in a surprising move after United failed to renew his contract. At Pirates, the 28-year-old featured in six league matches stating only one. The other five appearances were as a substitute. He also played in three Caf Confederation Cup matches for Bucs. It is not clear whether Pirates want to loan him or terminate his contract which expires next June. “Pirates are in talks to release Mngonyama because he barely played for the club last season,” said the insider. “He’s set to leave Pirates. He is set to be informed of the club’s decision in the coming days or weeks.” Pirates, in the meantime, are set to welcome Thapelo Xoki from AmaZulu, who they have signed in a swap deal with Gabadinho Mhango, who is going in the opposite direction. Pirates are also set to make a decision on their captain Happy Jele whose contract expires at the end of the month. He was given a one-year rolling contract extension at the beginning of this past season. The 35-year-old from Middleburg featured in 33 matches in all competitions, scoring four goals. Pirates will also decide on the future of veteran goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands. While Sandilands did not play any games last season. He was on the bench 23 times in all competitions but is set to be given a goalkeeping coaching job within the club.
