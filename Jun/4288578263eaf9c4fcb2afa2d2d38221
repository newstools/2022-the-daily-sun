THE case of former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and 21 co-accused will no longer be heard in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. On Monday, 13 June, the matter was before the Durban High Court, where the pre-trial was supposed to begin. The accused face charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering related to an irregular Durban Solid Water tender. However, Gumede was not in court as it was an administrative appearance for parties to engage one another about documentation and other issues that are outstanding in preparation for the trial, which is set to begin on 18 July. At the last appearance in March, the matter was postponed for one of the accused, Zithulele Mkhize, to get a lawyer as he no longer had one. During his appearance on Monday, Mkhize said he started to look for a lawyer last week because of financial difficulty. The lawyers also asked that the state release the R9 million seized funds as they needed R3 million for the case. One of the accused is former eThekwini municipal manager, Sipho Nzuza. All the accused are out on bail.
