STANLEY Khoza needs SunReaders to assist him with sponsorship for his karate classes. The founder of Amandla Esizwe Karate-do Gojukai said he taught kids around KwaMashu, north of Durban, karate for free but his club was struggling financially. “Karate expenses include membership fees to associations, grading fees, tournament fees, travelling costs, clothing and equipment,” he said. Stanley said he focused on teaching girls and boys aged between six and 16. “The minds and bodies of children in this age group are easier to condition. It’s better to prevent bad habits than cure them,” he said. “However, we don’t exclude older people if they also want to start karate training.” Stanley said he founded his club in 1982 to keep youth active and away from bad influences. “The first benefit of karate training is discipline. “It’s also great for physical health and boosting one’s confidence. “Children who have self-confidence are not easily bullied at school,” he said. Stanley said karate also taught kids how to defend themselves, which could save their lives. He said many of his former students had become engineers, accountants, actors, doctors, priests, businesspeople and government officials. Stanley said the community had been very supportive over the years but it would be great if all parents supported their children by attending karate events and funding their activities. “It would also be better if the government and private sector supported the development of karate as it contributes to the social well-being of our society,” he said. “We would teach karate in even more areas if we had financial support to do so. “We would be grateful if SunReaders could encourage individuals, businesspeople and the government to fund our karate activities,” said Stanley.
