WHENEVER Joshua Masilela sees the police, his anger boils up. This is because cops allegedly damaged his right eye in 2021. The 48-year-old military veteran from Middelburg, Mpumalanga, was jogging on 18 August when five cops in a bakkie stopped him. He said they asked why he was running at night and accused him of instigating a violent protest in the Steve Tshwete Municipality. Joshua said while he was trying to explain, one of the cops allegedly hit him in the face with a gun. He claimed they then assaulted him. “They shot me with a rubber bullet in my right hand as I ran home. When I got home, I realised my eye was damaged and went to the hospital. They transferred me to 1 Military Hospital, where I stayed for weeks.” Joshua said after he was discharged, he tried to open a case but was told he needed to do an identity parade. “I don’t know how I am going to identify the cops because they were all wearing masks and hats.” He said he had not been the same since the incident and had a deep hatred of cops. “This has affected me a lot psychologically. I get very angry every time I see the police. They made my life miserable,” he said. “I have two children. How am I going to take care of my two kids if my employer lets me go because I can’t work properly?” Joshua said he wanted the police to pay him for the damage they allegedly caused. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said a case of assault was opened with the Middelburg police and referred to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.
