MZANSI businesses and residents have been hit hard by the stage 6 load
shedding, but it’s about to end soon. Mzansi can brace for more darkness as Eskom announced the implementation
of Stage 6 load shedding this afternoon, from 2 pm. In a statement, the power utility said: “Due to the continued unlawful
strike Stage 6 load shedding will be implemented at 14:00 until midnight. Stage
6 will again be implemented from 05:00 until midnight on Friday.” Eskom said a minimum of Stage 4 will be required continuously over the
weekend and it will continue to evaluate the situation and closely monitor the
system. “The high levels of staff absenteeism and intimidation of working
employees in some of the power stations is still rife. This has made it difficult to conduct routine
maintenance and other operational requirements, which will further impact the reliability of generation
units, Eskom said. It further said due to the unlawful and unprotected strike, which has
caused widespread disruption to Eskom’s power plants, it is still unable to
return some generators to service. “Eskom is compelled to take this unprecedented step to conserve
emergency generation capacity to safeguard the power system. There remains a
risk that the stage of load shedding may have to change at any time, depending
on the state of the plant,” the statement read.
