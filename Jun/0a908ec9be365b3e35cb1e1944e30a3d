Gogo said when their relationship was still new she once moered a woman she found at the front gate of her boyfriend’s house. “I spent the night at his place and when I went out in the morning I met a young woman at the gate who wanted to go into his place,” said gogo Thelma. “He had told me he didn’t have a woman in his life. Now suddenly here was this woman.” She said the woman told her she was an old magogo and she was fresh. “She told me I must date people of my own age. I went for her. I thought our man was going to stop the fight but instead he ran away,” she laughed. Luvuyo said he met Thelma on New Year’s Eve all those years ago. “I went into a tavern and she was sitting alone while everyone else had a partner. I sat with her and she told me that she had just lost her mother so she was drinking to feel better.” Luvuyo said when they talked he found that Thelma had a fun character. “I fell in love right away,” he said. Gogo has three children from her previous marriage but they don’t have kids together.
