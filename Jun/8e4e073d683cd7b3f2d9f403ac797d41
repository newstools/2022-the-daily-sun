Protest action has caused the Rea Vaya bus operations to be suspended in Soweto on Monday, 20 June. The suspension of the services is due to a shutdown in the kasi. “Rea Vaya bus operation has been suspended due to the Shutdown in Soweto, commuters will be updated as soon as the service is back,” Rea Vaya said in a Tweet. “All main roads along @ReaVayaBus routes in Soweto are blocked by protesters. All busses have been stopped coming from the depot and the first busses that were on route were turned back to the depot. Currently Rea Vaya services have been suspended,” the City of Joburg said. ??Rea Vaya bus operation has been suspended due to the Shutdown in Soweto, commuters will be updated as soon as the service is back.^BM pic.twitter.com/6bsBg3z8Ob #JHBTraffic All main roads along @ReaVayaBus routes in Soweto are blocked by protesters.
