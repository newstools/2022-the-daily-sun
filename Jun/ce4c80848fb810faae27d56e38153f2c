THE director of Mosego Home was warned not to implicate Life Esidimeni in the deaths of mental health patients. Advocate Harry van Bergen representing Life Esidimeni, asked the director of the home, Mmaletsatsi Mogojoa if she would agree that she was not in a position to know what caused the deaths of patients at Mosego during the Marathon Project. This was after Mogojoa testified at the Life Esidimeni inquest in the Pretoria High Court on Wednesday, 8 June that she was not directly involved in the day-to-day care of patients and she relied on qualified medical staff to inform her of issues relating to patients. Mogojoa said she was involved in operations, finances and logistics at the home. Of the 144 mental patients who died, at least seven died at Mosego. Mogojoa said: “I’m not a doctor that examined corpses to come up with the cause of death.” Bergen responded: “By virtue of that, you cannot comment on the deaths as you have now stated you cannot implicate any person or entity on what caused the deaths. You are not here to implicate Life Esidimeni to have caused the deaths.” Bergen pointed out that Mogojoa later amended her initial affidavit indicating that Life Esidimeni only provided “some” documents relating to the patients. Bergen questioned Mogojoa whether the amendment was an attempt to shift blame. Mosego’s legal representative objected to Bergen’s line of questioning, adding that the evidence relating to medical documents of patients was already before the court.
