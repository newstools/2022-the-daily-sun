A 36-year-old has joined the growing list of male magoshas. The man from Orlando West, Soweto said he started working as a magosha on Monday, 30 May. He told Daily Sun he’s been looking for a job for years without any luck and almost turned to crime just to make a quick buck. He said he sometimes did part-time jobs and with the money he made, he couldn’t support his family in KZN. “I’ve been thinking of becoming a magosha for the past two years. It wasn’t an easy decision, but I have finally done it,” he told the People’s Paper. “I render my services to men and women, young and old. Yes, gogos are also welcome to dial my number.” He said the People’s Paper also motivated him to become a magosha. He said he reads the paper everyday and has seen how businesses flourish because of the exposure. “I’ve seen many magosha stories and other business stories,” he said. He said that he was great in bed and lasted longer as long as anybody wanted. “I’ve got a great tlof tlof drive. I can go at any pace. I can be fast and hard, or gentle and slow. It’s up to a client,” he said. He said he was charging from as little as R150 per round. “I don’t have a girlfriend, so don’t worry about any drama. I’m here if you need me.” “I want to focus on fulfilling the desires of the people.” One of his clients said she has him on speed dial. “I will definitely be a regular customer. He makes sure I’m comfortable before we start. “Even after he’s done, he won’t chase you away like it was just a business call. “He’ll talk to you if that’s what you want. I can’t describe how great he is at what he does,” said the client.
