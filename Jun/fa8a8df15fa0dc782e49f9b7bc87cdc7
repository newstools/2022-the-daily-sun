ENSURING that the country does not fall into flames is a burden that falls squarely on the shoulders of the youth. This was the sentiment put forward by Mandla Nkomfe, the deputy chairman of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation. He was speaking at the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum in Soweto last week. Organisations including Corruption Watch, Voice of the People, Section27, Equal Education, Azania27, ASRI, Right to Protest and Fridays for Future attended. A Youth Day Parade for Justice and Change will take place on June 16 and supporters will begin to gather from 9am at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Tshwane before moving through the streets to the Union Buildings. This will provide a platform for young people to express their aspirations for a truly equal, just, non-sexist, and non-racial society. Nkomfe said the parade came at an opportune moment, as the voices of young people needed to be heard. Over 80 organisations from various sectors of society have officially endorsed the parade.
