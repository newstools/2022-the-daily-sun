A 31-YEAR-OLD male suspect was released on a warning by the East London Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 28 June on allegations of Road Accident Fund (RAF) fraud. According to Captain Yolisa Mgolodela, it is alleged that the accused was involved in a car accident in 2007. She said the mother of the accused is reported to have submitted a claim to the RAF, it was processed and paid out to the claimant. “In 2019, the accused and his mother are reported to have submitted another claim with the RAF. The claim was processed but the RAF picked up that it was a duplicate,” Mgolodela said in a statement. She said before the money was paid out, the RAF reported the matter to the Hawks for probing, which resulted in the arrest of the suspect on 28 June. “The investigations revealed that the accused nearly prejudiced the RAF cash to the value of R750 000. “He made his first court appearance in the Mdantsane Magistrates Court where he was released on a warning,” said Mgolodela. The matter is remanded to 8 July for legal representation.
