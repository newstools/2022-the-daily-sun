THE career of a cop has ended after he was jailed for bribery! The officer, identified only as Captain Shange (58), was arrested during a joint undercover operation by the National Anti-Corruption Unit and Independent Police Investigative Directorate. Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesman Simon Zwane said Shange’s arrest and conviction followed an investigation initiated by RTMC’s anti-corruption unit in April 2021. “The investigation was prompted by complaints from members of the public who alleged that law enforcement officers were extorting bribes from motorists, south of Gauteng,” said Zwane. He said an undercover agent was assigned to a roadblock conducted by the South African Police Service in Observatory, Joburg. “The agent was stopped by Captain Shange, who demanded a bribe, for a traffic violation. Money exchanged hands and Shange was arrested on the scene by the joint team. He was detained at Yeoville police cells,” Zwane said. On 27 May, Shange was sentenced to four years of direct imprisonment. after several testimonies were presented in the magistrate court. RTMC CEO Makhosini Msibi said it was shameful that a career of a high-ranking officer had ended in such a disgraceful manner. “We thank our team for demonstrating their willingness to enforce ethical conduct on the roads regardless of who is involved and what their rank is. All citizens are equal before the law,” Msibi said.
