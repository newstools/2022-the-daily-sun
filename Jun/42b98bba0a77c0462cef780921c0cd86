A SIX-YEAR-OLD died at an initiation school on Monday night, 27 June. The boy, who was diagnosed with epilepsy, was admitted to the school in Setlaleng Village, outside Bolobedu in Limpopo, despite the Department of Traditional Affairs saying no children under 12 should be initiated. Both the parents and the school went against the Limpopo Initiation Schools Act by enrolling the boy. The school was closed and its traditional caregivers were suspended. MEC Basikopo Makamu said incidents such as this would not be tolerated. He said unfortunately, the province had not met its target of zero deaths during this initiation season. “We have swiftly moved to close down the initiation school and immediately suspended the traditional caregivers and surgeons who were operating there,” he said. Makamu said since the beginning of the season, the department had been begging parents to follow the law. “We condemn in the harshest terms the admission of underage children at initiation schools for this exact reason,” he said. “We are heartbroken that an innocent life has been cut short at such a tender age.” Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mamphaswa Seabi said reports indicated the child arrived at the school on Tuesday, 21 June, while sick. He said the school called the boy’s parents to bring him medicine, which they did. “He later got sick and collapsed on the way to the car to be taken to the hospital. Emergency personnel were called and he was certified dead on the scene,” he said. “Injuries were found on the private parts, due to circumcision. The body was taken to a government mortuary and aA post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death.” Seabi said no arrests had been made yet.
