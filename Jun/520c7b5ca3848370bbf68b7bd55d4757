POVERTY, youth unemployment and service delivery headlined the EFF Youth Day commemoration in Thohoyandou in Venda, Limpopo on Thursday, 16 June. EFF leader Julius Malema said it was time people from the Vhembe district stop voting for leaders based on their tribe. “People of Vhembe must stop this thing of saying, Ramaphosa is a Venda, he’s from here. So what? What has he done for you? We’ve never met such a useless Venda in our lifetime,” he said. “We don’t have water and jobs. We don’t want a president who is Venda. “We want a president who will give jobs, whether they are Venda, Tsonga, Pedi or Zulu, it doesn’t matter.” He said the ANC must be ashamed as it has forgotten about people from Vhembe. He also criticised people from Vhembe. “We know 80% of Vhembe people will vote for them, yet you don’t have jobs, water, electricity, houses and proper roads. “They no longer hide that they are stealing because they know you will still vote for them. When you talk, they silence you with R350. We don’t want R350, we want jobs,” said Malema. Malema also weighed in on the much-publicised Phala Phala Farm scandal. “How can a man be so rich to a point where he puts money under the mattress? Me and you, we are not going to eat today when we sleep. The president’s bank account is too full. He can no longer save money, he now puts it under the mattress.” The Vhembe district recently made headlines as the rape capital of the country. Malema urged men in the region to self-introspect. “Let Vhembe be known as a place for peace and respect for one another. It cannot be a capital city of rape. “To show that you are under some spell, you’ve now started to rape gogos. What type of madness is that? This sickness must stop. It must be stopped by the men of Vhembe,” he said.
