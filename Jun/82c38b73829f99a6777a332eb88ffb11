FORMER correctional services commissioner Arthur Fraser has opened a criminal case against President Cyril Ramaphosa for charges ranging from theft, kidnapping, defeating ends of justice and bribery. In a statement released on Wednesday, June 1 evening, Fraser said he opened the case at a Rosebank Police station and has handed the police evidence supporting his allegations. The supporting evidence according to his statement included video footage, bank accounts, photographs and names of people. He said the charges emanated from Ramaphosa's theft of $4 million stolen from his Phala Phala farm in Waterberg, Limpopo by thugs who colluded with his domestic worker. Fraser said the millions in foreign currency were concealed on his farm. Fraser claims that the thugs were later kidnapped and interrogated on the farm and the incident was hidden from the law authorities and people were later bribed although he doesn't specify who had been bribed. "I trust that the police and the prosecuting authorities will investigate this matter without fear or favour, I also trust that the President will take the nation into his confidence and accept or deny that the events I describe in my affidavit occurred on his property,” concluded Fraser. The Presidency had not yet responded to the claimed charge by Wednesday, June 1 evening.
