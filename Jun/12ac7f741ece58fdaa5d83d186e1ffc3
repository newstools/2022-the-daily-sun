THE murder trial of former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa continued at the North Gauteng High Court on Friday, 3 May. And, it was heated for a while when Advocate Malesela Teffo logged heads with Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela when he wanted a trial within a trial to verify that his clients were supposed to be in that court. As the two got into a heated argument about proceedings, Teffo said: “It’s not safe to argue between you and me. I just wanted to make a submission and I should not be expedited. This is very important for my client, and I have to do my best to defend my client.” Then Judge Maumela said: “The same as you are not going to tell how to run my trial, Teffo. You are not going to tell me how to run this trial. The tail, in this instance, will not wag the dog in my name.” The case was postponed to 6 June, after first state witness Sergeant Thabo Mosia was not feeling well enough to continue with the cross-examination.
