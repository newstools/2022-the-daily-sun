THE ANC Gauteng elective conference is set to officially kick off this Friday, 24 June, to elect new leadership. The top leadership battle for chairmanship will be a rematch between Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile and current deputy chairman and Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. The two went head-to-head for the deputy chair at the last conference, where Lesufi emerged victorious. It was not clear what time the conference would start or who would open it between President Cyril Ramaphosa and treasurer general Paul Mashatile. Even though provincial secretary Jacob Khawe had assured that the conference would go ahead despite outstanding branch disputes, communication had been minimal. Khawe had said it would kick off on Thursday to allow delegates to discuss policy documents in preparation for the party’s conference, but media accreditation was in disarray with last-minute requests for journalists. Accreditation was only from Thursday evening and on Friday morning. By Friday mid-morning, the programme had not been distributed. Khawe, at a press conference on Wednesday, 22 June, had said the provincial executive committee had given the national dispute resolution committee until Thursday to resolve outstanding disputes. These were emanating from the Ekurhuleni regional conference – that led to 19 votes being quarantined. And for this reason, final results for chairmanship, that the former Ekurhuleni mayor was leading, were yet to be declared. And it had now emerged in media reports that in fact, 27 branches were unconstitutionally constituted and not five detected by national executive committee deployee Jeff Radebe. The matter, according to reports, was to come under discussion at a special NEC meeting on Thursday night, which could potentially lead to a rerun of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was yet to be announced.
