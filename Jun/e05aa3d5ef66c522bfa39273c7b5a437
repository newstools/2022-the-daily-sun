RESIDENTS of Mmakaunyane, North West, will not use Moeka-Vuma Police Station as it is too far. They said they had been getting services from Dube Police Station for years, but learnt in April that they must report to Moeka-Vuma. On Saturday, 28 May, a meeting was held and it was resolved that if Community Safety and Transport Management MEC Sello Lehari didn’t reverse the decision, they would take to the streets. Leo Ndaba (76) said the new police station roughly 20 to 25km away. “It will be difficult to reach it due to the distance. Criminals will take advantage and commit crime, knowing that Moeka-Vuma is far away and it will take forever for the police to get to the scene,” said Ndaba.  Gogo Caroline Motlhamme (80) said: “We want Dube station to continue servicing us. “No one should force the elderly to travel a long distance just to get services.” Reuben Malete (44) said it was time they moved from Moretele and fell under Tshwane as they were getting services from there. Shangy Mbekwa, PR Councillor and leader of Agenda to Citizenry Governors, said there were no consultations when the decision was made. “We only heard from the station commanders of both stations that we are now reporting to Moeka-Vuma.” Community Safety and Transport Management spokeswoman Boitshoko Moremi said Lehari would schedule a meeting with SAPS management to discuss the matter.
