TWO suspects aged 32 and 38 were arrested on Monday after they were caught offloading stolen copper cables in City Deep, Joburg. According to Colonel Dimakatso Sello, police received information about a hijacked trailer carrying stolen copper cables. “Upon arrival at the said venue, members found the copper, a truck and trailer – all suspected to be stolen. Two men were arrested and will appear in court soon on charges of possession of suspected stolen property,” said Sello. She said police recovered copper worth about R15 million. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said infrastructure-related crimes were a priority to the police as they negatively impact the economy and service delivery. “To ensure continuous positive successes, the province has established a multi-disciplinary task team, which includes all law enforcement agencies, state-owned entities and other industry stakeholders to ensure that resources and expertise are brought together with the purpose of curbing these crimes,” said Mawela.
