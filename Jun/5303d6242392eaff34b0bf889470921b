THE City of Tshwane is on a mission to recoup the R17 billion owed by government departments, businesses, residents and embassies. The municipality has resumed its revenue collection campaign #TshwaneYaTima and announced that 10 teams, headed by senior managers, including a high tension team, have been deployed to disconnect defaulting customers. The campaign also targets prepaid electricity meters that have been tampered with. Municipal spokesman Selby Bokaba said 33 000 meters had already been found to have been tampered with. “Tshwane embarked on a revenue-and-debt-collection campaign from 8 February, which focused mainly on defaulting government departments, embassies, businesses and other entities. “The #TshwaneYaTima blitz, which lasted until the end of February, has been resurrected and will also include defaulting residential customers. “The R17 billion debt makes it difficult for the city to fulfil its obligation of delivering essential and basic services,” he said. South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) regional secretary in Tshwane, Thamsanqa Kenke, said the approach by the Democratic Alliance- led administration is not fair. He said the city’s real aim is to punish black people in kasis as they’re poor. “There will be hell if they come near our townships. We will make them run. “We strongly reject this move and should they proceed with this campaign, they will find us waiting for them,” he said.
