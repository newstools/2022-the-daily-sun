A MAN (56) was arrested by the police at a funeral in Phola outside Hazyview, Mpumalanga, after being caught with a suspected stolen vehicle on Sunday, 26 June, at around 5pm. He made his appearance in the KaBokweni Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 28 June and he was not asked to plead on the count of possession of a suspected stolen vehicle. The same court had him remanded in custody until his appearance in the Masoyi Magistrates Court on 1 July for a formal bail application.  Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed that police received information about a vehicle, an Isuzu single cab bakkie, which was previously hijacked in Acornhoek in May. “Police then proceeded to the scene where the vehicle was said to have been seen. Upon arrival at the scene, the bakkie was found and the suspect who attended a funeral was arrested. A case of possession of suspected stolen vehicle was opened at the Masoyi Police Station,” said Mohlala.  The Mpumalanga police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela, said: “We welcome the arrest as well as the recovery of the vehicle, commending the incredible work done by members of the community who alerted police when they noticed the suspected stolen car.”
