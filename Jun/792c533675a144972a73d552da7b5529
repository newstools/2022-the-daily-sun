CHILDREN at Sediba Sa Tsebo Early Childhood Development Centre have called for an end to child abuse. The children from the creche in Odi in Mabopane, Tshwane, marched a kilometre with their teachers on Tuesday, 7 June, to raise awareness about abuse. Principal Annah Mabasa said the march was organised to give children a platform to raise their voices against the crimes committed against them. She said it also aimed to teach them about child abuse, bullying and gender-based violence. “We believe the earlier we teach our children about the ills in our community, the more we equip them to speak out,” she said. Annah said the kids were also calling on their elders to protect them. She said it was the responsibility of everyone in the communities to keep children safe. “We wanted to teach our children about child abuse so they know what it is and how to report it,” she said. “We want our children to know that no one has the right to touch their private parts and if someone does that, they must speak to someone they trust.” Annah said they also wanted children to know that assault was a crime and they should report it. She said as a principal, she sometimes dealt with children who came to school with bruises but were scared to speak up. Parent Tshepiso Morengwe said it was heart warming to see the children raising their voices. She said she hoped people would listen and start protecting children. “These are our future presidents and they need to be protected,” she said.
