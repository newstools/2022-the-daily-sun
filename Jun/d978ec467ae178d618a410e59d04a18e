THE family of 38-year-old Abram Mahlangu has been left devastated after he was shot dead at an initiation school camp on 29 May. Zanele Mahlangu (44) said she was shocked when she received a call from cops on that day, telling her that her brother had been shot dead. She said her family was still trying to come to terms with her brother’s death, and wanted the truth as to why he had been shot. Zanele, from Tweefontein in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, said all they wanted was to see justice prevail.

He sometimes took his time coming back. I was shocked when I received a call from cops, saying he had died.” Another family member Matserana Mokoena (43) said he was waiting for Abram to come back from the bush. “There was a task that we were supposed to do together. I was shocked when I heard the bad news that he had died. Until today, nobody wants to tell us what exactly happened”, he said. Mpumalanga Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) chairman Siphosezwe Mahlangu said they did not condone the incident. “We condemn what happened and it is against our culture. We had many meetings before the culture started, and everybody was told that no weapons are allowed in camps. We are going to make a follow-up on the matter and see how it progresses,” he said. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said Isaac Kgomo (36) had appeared in the KwaMhlanga Magistrates Court, facing a charge of murder. He was appearing for the second time for a formal bail application, and the case was postponed to Monday, 20 June.
