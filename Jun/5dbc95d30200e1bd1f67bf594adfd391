“STOP killing us for body parts!” This is the heartfelt plea from the Albinism Foundation on International Albinism Awareness Day on Monday, 13 June. Freeman Chauke of Kasie Albinism Foundation said: “We are also human beings. Stop killing us based on superstitions that we have powers that can make you rich.” Pete Lengoabala of the Beauty by Nature Foundation said the day meant nothing as there was nothing to celebrate. “What are we celebrating when our children’s needs are not accommodated at school?” he said. As part of commemorating the day, Ster Kinekor and the foundation will hold an event at Carnival City, Ekurhuleni, to educate the public about the condition.
