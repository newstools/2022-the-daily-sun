FREE State police and National Defence Force members exchanged fire with suspects in the early hours Sunday, 5 June, before arresting 158 suspects with firearms and ammunition. Cops said the suspects wanted to cross the border between Free State and Lesotho and did not want to stop at a roadblock held on the R702/ R26 road. Brigadier Motansi Makhele said a convoy of vehicles including 13 Toyota Quantums, a grey Toyota Regius, red Volkswagen Golf and grey BMW 523i approached the roadblock, but the first Toyota Quantum failed to stop as indicated by the official. “Shots were fired from the minibus and the officials returned fire. One person was slightly injured during the crossfire and rushed to a hospital in Bloemfontein,” he said. Makhele said upon searching the vehicles, 158 passengers were found to be travelling into Mzansi without proper documents. Cops also confiscated a 9mm pistol with a magazine loaded with 16 live rounds, 7.65 Walther pistol with a magazine loaded with seven rounds and two loose 7.65mm rounds were found hidden in the BMW. “Five suspects were arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms, ammunition and possession of presumably stolen property. They’ll appear in the Wepener Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 7 June,” said Makhele.
