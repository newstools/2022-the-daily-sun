IT has recently emerged that a very large amount of money was stolen from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s farm in 2020. The amount taken from Phala Phala Farm in Bela Bela, Limpopo, is said to be between four and eight million US dollars (between R62 million and R124 million). This was claimed by former spy boss, Arthur Fraser, in an affidavit seen by the SunTeam. Fraser recently opened a kidnapping and bribery case against the president. In his affidavit, Fraser, said: “On 9 February, trespassing and housebreaking occurred at the main farmhouse at Phala Phala, during which an undisclosed sum of US dollars concealed in the furniture of the main house was unlawfully removed.” ALSO READ: Cyril: 'I have never stolen money from anyone' Fraser said the suspects were traced and found in Cape Town. They had apparently exchanged the dollars for Rands at an informal currency trading service run by a Chinese national. They apparently spent the money on cars and transferred it to bank accounts. Another suspect was allegedly traced to Namibia. “President Ramaphosa sought the assistance of the President of Namibia Hage Geingob in apprehending the suspect in Namibia,” said Fraser. According to Fraser, a helper at the farm and the five suspects were given R150 000 each to keep quiet about what happened. “After interrogating the four suspects, money and valuables were confiscated from them and Major-General Wally Rhoode and his team, on the instruction of the president, paid each suspect R150 000 in cash to conceal the events that took place at Phala Phala on 9 February,” said Fraser in the affidavit. In response to the matter, the president’s spokesman, Vincent Magwena, said he denied any criminal conduct and pledged his full co-operation with any police investigation.
