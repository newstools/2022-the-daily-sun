TEACHERS at Matthew Goniwe Memorial High School have had enough of being robbed, allegedly by pupils. A group of 20 gatvol teachers marched to Khayelitsha Police Station in Cape Town on Monday, 30 May, demanding that the cops protect them. A teacher told Daily Sun one of his colleagues was on leave to recover from the trauma of being robbed. “He was robbed and is terrified. These kids attack us when we are driving in traffic. They know teachers and what they have on them,” he said. “They asked one to give them a laptop, that they said they had seen him carrying in his class the previous day.” Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said four underage suspects, including a pupil at the school, were arrested after a teacher was robbed. “A case, registered on 12 May, is under investigation. A teacher was robbed of her bag and cellphone. She recognised one of the suspects as a pupil at the school. “Four suspects were arrested and appeared in court. “They were released into parental custody as juveniles and remanded until 14 June,” he said. Van Wyk confirmed teachers marched to the station to ask cops to protect them from pupils. “At around 9am, a group of about 20 teachers came to Khayelitsha Police Station from the mentioned high school. According to reports, the teachers were complaining about robberies in front of their school and at Jafta K Masemola Road, which they drive on,” he said. Provincial education spokeswoman Millicent Merton confirmed that teachers took to the streets to march to the cop shop to express their concerns.
