ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters (EFF) member Mxolisi Buthelezi was shot dead on Thursday, 2 May. He had just left home in Ogengele when attacked by unknown suspects who were in a car. They fired gunshots at him in a drive-by shooting, and he was killed on the spot. Another EFF member, who was with him at the time, sustained injuries and was rushed to a local clinic. “Buthelezi was a dedicated soldier of the movement. He was a committed activist of his community who served his people with pride. Not only was he the regional chairman of the EFF in Umkhanyakude, but he was also a councillor and executive member under the uMkhanyakude District Municipality. KwaZulu-Natal has always been known for political intolerance,” EFF said in a statement. The party called on the SAPS to urgently investigate the matter and find those who were involved in the brutal murder. “We strongly condemn the ongoing political killings in the province, and call for political stability and maturity, particularly during this time,” the statement added.
