A TEAM of psycho-social workers has been sent to counsel a family. KZN social development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza sent the team after a one-year-old and a nine-year-old were murdered on Monday, 30 May, allegedly by their mother in the Ebunganeni area of Mbazwana, northern KZN. It’s alleged the mother forced the older child to drink poison, while the toddler was strangled with a fence wire. The 26-year-old mother then attempted to kill herself by drinking a poisonous substance but she was found by cops and taken to hospital. She’s under police guard. Khoza said it was shocking that a mother could take the lives of her children. “We’re in so much pain for losing such innocent souls like this,” she said. Khoza said it was disheartening that many incidents of child abuse were registered during National Child Protection Week, which runs from 29 May to 5 June. KZN police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said cases of murder were opened by the Mbazwana police.
