PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has hailed the late AmaMpondo King Zanozuko Sigcau as a people’s king who fought his people’s cause. He urged his people to honour him by continuing to fight for the ownership of land. Delivering his eulogy at Sigcau’s funeral service in Flagstaff, Eastern Cape, on Tuesday, 21 June, Ramaphosa said at the time of his passing, Sigcau had been grappling with the matter of land for his people. And a land summit was held in Ekurhuleni two days before he passed. “The summit dealt with ownership of land by communities, land audits and conflict resolution mechanisms. These are issues His Majesty left us still grappling with, and which, working closely with all traditional leaders, we now need to resolve,” he told mourners.  The president also used the occasion to highlight pertinent issues affecting rural communities such as ukuthwala and initiation. He called for the elders to ensure young boys didn’t lose their lives at initiation schools. Ramaphosa also revealed how the late king once told him about his vision for his people and how he wished they wouldn’t be forced by poverty and desperation to leave their families to search for work in mining towns.
