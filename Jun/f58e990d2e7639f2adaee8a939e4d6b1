PRESIDENT
Cyril Ramaphosa said he was not involved in any criminal conduct and will
cooperate with the police. This
comes after a case of kidnapping and bribery was opened against the President
by former Spy boss Arthur Fraser on Wednesday, 1 June. In a
statement, the President’s spokesman Vincent Magwenya said, "President
Cyril Ramaphosa acknowledges that while there is much public interest and
concern about claims made in a criminal complaint against him, he remains
firmly focused on the task of rebuilding the economy and the
country." "The
President reaffirms that he was not involved in any criminal conduct, and once
again pledges his full cooperation with any police investigation. He confirms
that following the incident in February 2020, security has been improved around
his homes." READ: ANC mum on Ramaphosa charges! He
