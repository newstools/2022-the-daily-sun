WHEN they took over the Mamahlola Agricultural Project in 2017, it was in total shambles. But today, it is a growing enterprise thanks to the work of the leadership of the Mamahlola Communal Property Association. The association, which was claimed by the Banareng Ba Ga-Letsolalo in Tzaneen in Limpopo, was dysfunctional due to infighting and mismanagement. This resulted in a rapid collapse of commercial operations. The land reform and rural development department was forced to put it under judicial management in the early 2000s. Association chairman Samson Modiba said the current leadership fought to get control of the project and were put in power in 2017. Eager to turn things around so the project could serve its more than 1 500 households, they managed to revive it with the help of the Vumelana Advisory Fund. Today, the 40 hectare farm produces oranges, mangoes, avocados and macadamia nuts and has created 42 permanent jobs with 150 seasonal workers. It is now a multi-million rand project and continues to grow. Modiba said they received funding when they took over. “We had to make it work so we would not end up like other associations, which fail to run their projects and end up collapsing,” he said. “We had to make a statement that black people can also make it. “We are exporting our fresh produce and the farm has money to run its day-to-day operations.” He said a challenge they faced was accommodation for farm workers. “Public transport doesn’t reach our farm. We are also intimidated by other communities who only want to be employed,” said Modiba. Tumiso Makwela (32) joined the project in 2021 through a learnership. “I’m now a permanent employee. I enjoy every moment. I’m passionate about agriculture,” he said.
