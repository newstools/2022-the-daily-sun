THE Postbank has advised Mzansi of technical difficulties that are affecting transactions of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). In a statement, the bank said: “Postbank wishes to advise its customers that it is currently experiencing technical difficulties that affect their ability to perform transactions. The technical difficulties are due to an outage in one of our data centres.” It added that regrettably, the outage affected access to services across many channels including ATMs, retail merchants and in-branch transactions. “Access to Social Relief of Distress R350 grants funds and other Sassa payments through these channels are also impacted,” the statement read. Postbank said it would advise customers of the expected time to resolve these challenges.
