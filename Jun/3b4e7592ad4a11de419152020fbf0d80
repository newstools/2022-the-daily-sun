FORMER president Jacob Zuma has said Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) president, Mandisa Maya, grossly misdirected herself by refusing to reconsider his failed legal bid to force the removal of prosecutor Billy Downer from his corruption trial. Maya found there were no exceptional circumstances justifying she reconsider her court’s previous dismissal of Zuma’s attempted challenge to a ruling Downer had the title (legal standing) to prosecute him. Zuma insisted the SCA president, who is set to be interviewed for the position of deputy chief justice on Monday, 20 June, grossly misdirected herself in making this decision. He said the evidence produced by his lawyers clearly demonstrated that the “SCA failed to properly apply their minds to the critical constitutional and legal issues for consideration in my application for leave to appeal”. In an application filed at the Constitutional Court last week, Zuma sought an order setting aside Maya’s dismissal of his reconsideration application and then referring it back “for her to reconsider the application”. Zuma said: “It is in any event in the interests of justice for this court to entertain this application, because there are grounds on which the president failed to properly exercise her discretion to prevent a grave and demonstrable injustice in relation to the SCA order.” Alternatively, Zuma wants the apex court to grant him leave to appeal KwaZulu-Natal High Court Judge Piet Koen’s dismissal of his special plea application – in which he contended Downer lacked the impartiality and independence required to prosecute and sought to ventilate his oft-repeated claims his prosecution was fatally tainted by political interference and misconduct. In February, Koen dismissed Zuma’s application for leave to appeal his ruling and stressed the former president could raise the fair trial rights violations he claimed to have suffered at the hands of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) during his actual trial. – NEWS24
