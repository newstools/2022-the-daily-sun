Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane is officially back in Mzansi. Just days after suffering heartache in the CAF Champions League final, Mosimane is back home. The former Mamelodi Sundowns mentor is in the country for an important conference. Mosimane was invited as one of the keynote speakers at the Women + Men against child abuse press conference in Sandton. As one of the biggest role models to men and woman in Mzansi, Mosimane’s voice in the fight against child abuse is very important. Jingles, as he is affectionately known, has flown Mzansi flag high in Egypt despite falling just short of a third successive Champions League trophy on Monday. And the pain from that 2-0 defeat to Wydad Casablanca in the final is still fresh in Mosimane’s mind, it seems. He was in no mood to entertain local media who were eager to pick his brain on the back of the final.
