T he sky is the limit for actor, dancer and singer Scelo “Seekay” Buthelezi. The 23-year-old, who plays Teddy on Mzansi Magic’s Gomora, told SunBuzz: “Teddy and I share several similarities but we are also very different. Teddy is obviously younger and less ambitious. “I’m a dreamer. I believe I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I love what I do and I am very passionate about the arts and entertainment.” Seekay has always been an entertainer for as long as he can remember. “At school, I took up drama and became really good at it. By the time I passed matric I’d already decided I wanted to be in showbiz. I then signed up for a two-year performance course at the Market Theatre where I got my training,” he said.

I feel blessed because my acting career has opened up so many doors for me. In 2021, I released my debut single, Ben 10. This year I released another single, Harare. This is an adventurous song. It takes your mind on a beautiful adventurous trip. On this song I worked with Tony Duardo.” The song is a mix of amapiano, Afro-beats, and chimurenga music. “Chimurenga is a Zimbabwean music genre popularised by Thomas Mapfumo and Oliver ‘Tuku’ Mtukudzi. My plan is to release an EP featuring some of my favourite artists such as Ciza, Tony Duardo and Flvme.” His dream is to grow his craft to a level where he can be recognised globally.
