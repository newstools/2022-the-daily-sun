Mzansi’s power utility Eskom has announced that due to the ongoing unprotected labour action, it is compelled to take precautionary actions to conserve emergency generation reserves. In a statement, the power utility said it will be implementing Stage 4 load shedding from 11-00 am until midnight. “On Saturday and Sunday Stage 4 load shedding will be implemented from 05:00 am until midnight. This is necessary to bolster emergency generation reserves to react to unforeseen circumstances,” Eskom said. However, Eskom cautioned the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks. “Eskom continues to closely monitor the system, adjust, and will communicate any changes as may be necessary. We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of all non-essential items,” the statement read.
