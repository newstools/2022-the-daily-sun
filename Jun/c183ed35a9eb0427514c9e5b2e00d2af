WHILE Minister Bheki Cele and his forensic team are trying to gather information about the cause of the mysterious deaths at Enyobeni Tavern in East London another “gig of death” is about to happen. It is a big gig scheduled to take place in Makhanda Municipality in Grahamstown on 2 July. One wonders if the SAPS intelligence is looking at the possibility that the next death might come from this event. It is alleged that it is an artistic advertisement like this one that lured young people to gather at Enyobeni Tavern at Scenary Park in East London. In isiXhosa language, inyoba is a secret place in which one hides in order to spend money without being disturbed. In this upcoming event scheduled for Grahamstown, the organisers strategically used the word “school” in the poster in order to attract the youth. The poster is placed at the corner of the Peace Park wall fence in Motherwell, Gqeberha. Judging on the number of people who are already planning to go to Grahamstown, many young people are expected to attend. Although the Eastern Cape Liqour Board confirmed the legal existence of Enyobeni Tavern, it allegedly attracted underage drinkers. Asking one senior citizen why this gig was targeting unemployed youth and leaving out adults, he said: “Adults are concerned about not drinking and driving. They are not interested in driving at night or under the influence of alcohol.” Another woman said: “The youth are deeply trapped in the world of blessers. So, no matter how much the price of the ticket and entertainment, they can afford it.”
