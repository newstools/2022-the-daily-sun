GREED got a former South African Police Service (SAPS) cashier in trouble for stealing money. Kgomotso Yvonne Mashala (35) was convicted on two counts of theft and sentenced by the Polokwane Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Monday, 30 May. According to Captain Matimba Maluleke, Mashala was working at Polokwane Police Station as a cashier between 19 January 2018 and 7 February 2018. She was responsible for receiving and depositing money into the state bank account. Maluleke said auditors conducted an audit and it was revealed that an amount of R264 729,60 was missing and unaccounted for during the period when Mashala was still a cashier. “The money was stolen on different dates. The matter was referred to the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation Unit for further probe. “After a thorough investigation by the Hawks, the National Prosecuting Authority issued the summons against Mashala to appear in court on 31 August 2018 and she was duly served,” Maluleke said. He said Mashala was out on bail until she was sentenced as follows: “On count 1, Mashala was sentenced to five years imprisonment wholly suspended on the condition that she repays R183 727,70. On count 2, she was sentenced to three years imprisonment or R5 000 fine also wholly suspended on condition that she repays an amount of R81 001,90. The total amount to be repaid is R264 729,60,” Maluleke added.
