THE National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is engaging with relevant authorities in regards to the arrest of the Gupta brothers. Rajesh and Atul Gupta were arrested in Dubai on Monday, 6 June. The South African government wants the brothers and their wives to be returned to the country to face charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering relating to state capture. NPA spokesman Mthunzi Mhaga said extradition was a complex process involving many role-players. “It would, therefore, not be appropriate for the NPA to discuss the details of that process in the media. But we can confirm that we are engaging with relevant authorities in SA and the United Arab Emirates,” he said. In July 2021, the NPA’s investigative directorate applied to Interpol to assist with executing arrest warrants for Atul and his wife Chetali, Rajesh and his wife Arti, Ankit Jain, Ravindra Nath, Ramesh Bhat and Jagdish Parekh. Former Transnet board member Salim Essa and three former senior Free State government officials have already appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court. They face charges of procurement fraud involving R24 million paid by the provincial agriculture department to Nulane Investment, a company owned by Essa’s business partner and former Gupta associate Iqbal Sharma. Mhaga said: “The NPA has an experienced team of internal and external experts who are working closely with law enforcement and our partners in the criminal justice system on the matter.” The Dubai police confirmed the arrest, saying they received a red notice for the brothers from Interpol. A statement read: “The arrest reflects continuous efforts of the UAE in combating money laundering crimes through local co-operation among the competent authorities. “This including the ministry of justice, Dubai public prosecution, executive office to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, financial intelligence and through coordination and collaboration with international counterparts.”
