RESIDENTS were left shocked after a 25-year-old man was allegedly killed by his 33-year-old girlfriend on Sunday, 5 June. According to residents, Bubele “Buja” Mbityana lived with his girlfriend in Covid-19 squatter camp in Enkanini, Khayelitsha. One of the residents, Fezeka Manakaza (28), said they heard shouting, which sounded like a fight. There was then a knock on the door with Buja asking them to open the door. “We were drinking earlier and thought he wanted to ask for more beer, so we ignored him,” said Fezeka. But Buja continued to knock, so they went outside to check. They found him lying face down with his hand holding his chest. Bekithemba Bulu (25) said it’s sad that his friend died such a painful death. A group of residents went to the alleged killer’s house to ask her what happened. She allegedly confessed that she stabbed Buja during a fight. When residents told her he died, the woman ran out of her shack. “She lost her mind. She thought he was going to be fine after stabbing him,” said Bekithemba. Another friend told Daily Sun Buja confided in him that he was not happy with his sugar mama. “She was too controlling,” he said. Buja’s relative Andisiwe Mbaleki (28) said they were shocked by his death. “He was a good soul and he will be greatly be missed,” she said. Police spokesman Sergeant Wesley Twigg said the woman handed herself over to the police. “Once charged the suspect will appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court. The investigation into the matter continues,” he said.
