GAUTENG has been hit by a big stink since the morning on Wednesday, 8 June. It was not clear what type of chemical or where it was coming from. But last year, there was a similar stench that was believed to have been a combination of elevated levels of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. At the time, the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries said during an inspection, it found that the release of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide from the Sasol plant in Mpumalanga was within the approved limits of the Atmospheric Emission Licence issued by the Gert Sibanda Municipality on 23 April 2019. Mzansi took to social media to describe the bad smell in the air around the province. Bazooka said: “Take N4 to Emalahleni then drive to Secunda. They are exposed to this on a daily basis.” Mr Makhubele said: “Yeah, it’s worse out here in Germiston.” Then Trish said: “It’s disgusting and unhealthy. Why must we put up with this and then have to pay carbon emission taxes?” Bazooka replied: “You can imagine what people close to these emissions go through on a daily basis when we complain in Gauteng about it after one day.”
