NELSON Mandela Bay is taking a tough stance on car washes using municipal water illegally, confiscating their hose pipes and vacuum cleaners. Municipal joint operations committee spokesman Luvuyo Bangazi said: “Metro police went all out in Gqeberha CBD, enforcing water restrictions as the city battled one of its worst droughts. Four car wash owners were fined R1 500 each on Tuesday, 14 June for using hose pipes on their premises. “According to water and sanitation bylaws, nobody was allowed to use municipal water to run a car wash and the use of hose pipes is also forbidden. A fine was also levied against a business owner selling borehole water,” said Bangazi. The operation to catch reckless water users comes as the city welcomed humanitarian organisation Gift of the Givers’ commitment to assist the Bay in dealing with the persistent water crisis. The NGO will dig at least 10 boreholes around the city to help ease Day Zero. The drilling crew started at Alpha Primary School in Gelvandale on Tuesday, 14 June and more sites will be selected once the process is underway. Founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said: “The first drilling is critical to give us a deeper understanding of the way forward in terms of geology, water yield, metallic and salt content and the depth to drill, among other factors. “Day Zero has arrived, with many communities progressively experiencing dwindling supplies over the last weeks and now complete shutdown. We would prioritise schools and hospitals for boreholes because schools can't be closed due to a shortage of water. “To succeed and overcome this crisis, it is important that all of us work together. We thank the municipality for calling us here to see how we can work together.  We also encouraged residents to be more responsible as the less water we use, the longer we can survive this crisis and hopefully, the rain will come to fill up dams," Sooliman said.
