AS A 12-year-old boy in Grade 6, Tiyani Mbendzami started losing his eyesight. Instead, he turned his adversity into an asset and bBy the time he was totally blind two years later, he had made up his mind that he would be a fully functional member of society. Today, the 22-year-old from Malamulele in Limpopo is a law student at the University of Joburg (UJ). He said when his vision started failing, he thought it was something that could be treated. But he found out he had a specific form of cataract that could not be treated. “After some treatments, I realised I was on permanent load shedding,” he joked. Tiyani said he had to learn the transition to living with a disability wasn’t easy.how to use braille so that he could continue studying. “Braille was difficult but I pushed through. When I moved to a special school, I told myself that I was going to work hard and excel in everything,” he said. He went to a new school where he learnt that there are others who are also blind. Tiyani threw himself into his studies. Being a hardworker, Tiyani got five distinctions in matric and was number one in Economics and Tsonga across Mzansi. “I enrolled at UJ. I wanted to live far away from home to show my family that I can take care of myself,” said Tiyani. He decided to study law because he wanted to defend people who were being prejudiced against for being different. “I advocate for the rights of people like me.” I started an organization where I go around teaching people living with disabilities about their rights. I also encourage them not to look down on themselves. I tell them everyone has disabilities, it’s just that some are more physical than others,” he said. Tiyani said he wants his life to be an example that success favours anyone who works hard not only those who are able.
