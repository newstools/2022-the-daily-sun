MANDLA Ndlovu has urged pupils to grab all learning opportunities to build a brighter future. The new Mpumalanga MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs was speaking at a career exhibition on Monday, 30 May in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge. The event was organised by the Inkomati-Usuthu Catchment Management Agency and the Department of Education. Addressing pupils, Ndlovu said: “I won’t be happy to see you staying in relationships because of hunger. “I don’t want you to have blessers. “I want you to become your own blessers.” Inkomati-Usuthu executive for corporate services, Advocate Bernard Shabangu, said the aim of the expo was to provide quality career information. Nxumalo High School grade 11 pupil Thando Mnisi (16) said the MEC’s speech inspired him.
