A SCUFFLE at a kasi mall ended in death on Saturday, 28 May. Vusimuzi Ntuli (22) was shot dead, allegedly by a guard, at Moloto Big Tree mall in Tshwane. Brother Simphiwe (25) said Vusimuzi had bought alcohol and wanted to drink. But the guard told him and friends that they couldn’t do so. “It’s alleged that later, Vusimuzi went to buy chops at the mall but his bank card was declined. He started shouting and talking to himself.”  Simphiwe said he was approached by a guard, who told him to leave. “But he came back because he had left his wallet, and a scuffle ensued.

At the time of going to print, mall management hadn’t responded to Daily Sun’s inquiry.
