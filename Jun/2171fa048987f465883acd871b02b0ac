FORMER drug addict, Milani Sijorha said losing his father at a young age drove him to substance abuse and nearly destroyed his life. The 27-year-old spoke about his experiences at a Father’s Day event at JL Zwane Church in Gugulethu, Cape Town, on Sunday 19 June. The event hosted different speakers, who discussed challenges faced by fathers. Umhlobo Wenene host, Tozama Ngcongolo was the MC of the event. Milani told the crowd he used drugs for 12 years and it nearly took his life over a cliff. “I started robbing people and hijacking cars. I became a pharaphara that nobody likes to see because I was causing too much trouble.” Milani told he SunTeam he started using drugs when he was in Grade 6. He used to take drugs with three of his friends. One of them ended up dead, while the other two are in prison. “I was doing all this to fill the void of being fatherless, but drugs never filled that void. Five years ago, I accepted Jesus into my life and it changed for the better. I now help other people stay away from drugs and those who are hooked to walk away,” he said. An author, Lonwabo Kulati, said it was important for fathers to prioritise being present in their children’s lives. “My mother got divorced when I was still very young. I grew up with my mother and her parents. Things happened that made me vow to myself that I would never let my children grow up without me,” he said. He said his teenage years were the best of his life as he lived with his father.
