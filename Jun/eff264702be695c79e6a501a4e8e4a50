BEN Motshwari might be a soccer star but this doesn’t mean
he doesn’t have problems. The Orlando Pirates midfielder has fallen behind on his
monthly car payments. AND NOW, ABSA IS TAKING HIM TO COURT! The bank wants to repossess his flashy 2015 VW Golf 7 GTI R. In court documents, seen by Daily Sun, the bank said the 31-year-old bought the car in 2015 for R609 628 at an interest rate of 5% per year. According to the agreement he entered into with the bank, he was supposed to pay monthly instalments of just over R12 000 for the Vrrr Pha. However, he didn’t make the payments and the bank started the legal process against him in March this year. ALSO READ |

Law firm Smit Sewgoolam Incorporated, acting on behalf of the bank, sent a letter to Motshwari stating that he was in arrears and owed R65 428 on 4 March. Another document reads: “The defendant had ample opportunity to settle the arrears or apply for forbearance plans before initiation of the litigation.” ALSO READ |
Teen shot with his own gun! A draft order from the High Court in Joburg confirmed the cancellation of the agreement and ordered that the car be returned to the bank.

They told the SunTeam that the lawyer dealing with the matter was not at work.
