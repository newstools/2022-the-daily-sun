THE family of teenager Mbuyiswa Buthelezi (15) has been left devastated by his death. To make matters worse, they had to learn that he had died on social media. Mbuyiswa died on Sunday, 26 June, after falling off a bakkie during a protest over electricity in Beirut kasi in QwaQwa, Free State. The bakkie was transporting tyres to protesters, who were furious after being without power for three weeks. A witness (36) said the bakkie was travelling at a high speed. “I’m not sure if the driver saw he fell off but instead of stopping, he drove over him. He continued with his journey and off-loaded tyres at the gate of a local mall,” said the witness. Mbuyiswa’s devastated mum, Sibongile, (43) said she was disgusted she had to learn he had died on Facebook. She said: “The family has no comment to make to the media as the whole world already heard about his death via social media. This is an injustice. We need privacy, please.” Phuthaditjhaba Police Station commander Brigadier Diau Ramolla said the 42-year-old driver of the bakkie was arrested and charged with public violence. “Five more suspects have been nabbed and detained. They will appear in the magistrates court soon, facing public violence charges,” said Ramolla. He said Crescent Mall and Setsing Plaza have been closed. Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality Mayor Gilbert Mokotso sent his condolences to the family. “We believe the perpetrators of these acts cannot be from Beirut, as has been said. I led a team that had very fruitful discussions with residents on Wednesday night and an extensive technical discussion with their representatives on Thursday morning,” he said.
