MEMBERS of the African National Congress (ANC) Youth League in Ward 17 in the Mangaung Metro, Free State, started Youth Month with a declaration of war against what they called a continued disregard for young people. They submitted their memorandum of demands to Ward Councillor Mampone Mohatle-Makhetha yesterday, 7 June. Ward 17 branch secretary, Molefi Qhekung accused the ward councillor of rejecting the capabilities of young people in projects. “Youth should be represented in the Project Steering Committee by a representative of their choice. The scope of work which leads to the Bill of Quantities should be transparent,” said . “The youth league should form part of any discussions and decision-making. “As young people, we must not be dictated to. We want to give our input in all projects,” said Qhekung. He was referring to a R28 million road construction project and a R60 million refurbishment of a primary school.  According to Qhekung, the councillor is denying the youth an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities on the projects and not allowing them to gain experience. “We are the elected leaders of the young people and we should be listened to and respected,” he said. “The councillor should not continue to act as if we don’t exist. “We represent the interests of young people and we will not allow anyone to silence us.” Qhekung said they demand that 30% of labourers in all projects should be the youth and people with disabilities. A further 30% should go to sub-contractors submitted by the youth. Ward councillor Mohatle-Makhetha refused to give her side of the story. Instead, she said: “I’m attending to a family meeting. My nephew has passed on and we are busy with arrangements. I will call you once I am done.”
