EFF members are demanding justice for fighter Mashudu Mathiba. He was shot in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, on 14 May, allegedly in the presence of the police. Members of the party marched to Tembisa Police Station on Wednesday, 1 June to demand a report on the matter. They accused the cops of dragging their feet in the case. EFF regional chairman Nkululeko Dunga told Daily Sun: “We are here because we want to hold the police to account in terms of their investigation into the murder case of Mathiba. “He was undertaking the EFF programme of recruitment and land occupation. “From what I know, people came and confronted him and ran away. We do not know what the intention was.” Dunga said they were forced to march to the police station because they were not getting feedback.

Dunga claimed the police never visited the crime scene, which had become contaminated. “We are going to come back here on Monday, 6 June as leaders of the EFF to get a status report because we have given them four days,” he said. “We are unapologetic. We are saying they must go and apprehend this guy because if we are the ones to apprehend him, we cannot guarantee we are going to bring him here.” EFF members said wearing their party clothing made them targets in the kasi. Tembisa police spokesman Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said they met the EFF leaders and the matter in question was under investigation.
