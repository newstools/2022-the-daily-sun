A DESPERATE mum needs help locating her daughter. Duduzile Lokhisini said she feared her child was dating an abusive man. The 41-year-old from Freedom Park, Soweto, said her daughter Zethu Mzongwana (18) had disappeared a number of times since 2018. She said the first time, she went gallivanting with her friends. “She hopped from one place to another and jJust before I went to open a case, she called to say she was happily living with her Nigerian boyfriend, who was taking care of her.” Duduzile said in November 2020, Zethu returned home heavily pregnant and apologised for leaving home. Duduzile said Zethu was well behaved while she was at home but when her baby was one week old, she left. “I remember it like it was yesterday. She acted like she was cleaning the yard and disappeared after that,” she said. Duduzile said she worked as a security guard and couldn’t take care of the baby, so she took the child to her mother in the Eastern Cape. She said she had been looking for Zethu ever since because the little one needs a birth certificate, so they can apply for a child support grant. One of Zethu’s friends told her she saw her in Joburg. “She was apparently in a bad condition. “She was being abused by her new boyfriend and it appeared she was taking drugs.” The mum said she was having sleepless nights and just wanted her daughter home. “The number of women who are killed in South Africa every single day is what bothers me. MyI feel that my child isn’t safe wherever she is and I need her to come back home.” She said she tried to open a case, but the cops apparently turned her away as Zethu had disappeared before. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo advised the mum to talk to the station commander.
