 South African National Parks (SANParks) Board has
announced that the disciplinary enquiry against its Chief Executive Officer,
Fundisile Mketeni has been finalised. In July 2021 the Board of SANParks initiated a
disciplinary process against the then CEO, and it was chaired by an independent
professional. The enquiry resulted in a ruling and recommended
sanction being delivered to the Board in May 2022. According to SANParks, the Board met, on Wednesday,
01 June to deliberate on the outcomes of the disciplinary process ruling and,
in line with the recommendation of the independent Senior Counsel who chaired
the process it determined that the relationship between the CEO and SANParks
will be terminated with immediate effect, as of 1 June, 2022. “Notwithstanding the outcomes of the criminal
proceedings against the CEO, the board decision was based on the CEO being
found guilty of 6 of the 7 charges levelled against the CEO based on his having
breached the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct Policy and the Disciplinary
Policy and Procedure of SANParks,” SANParks said in a statement.
