THE pre-sentencing of the accused in the Thoriso Themane murder case resumed in the Polokwane High Court yesterday, 28 June. Michael Teffo (18), Vincent Mothemela (18), Tshiamo Myeni (19) and accused fiveLesetja Ramokgopa (19) who were found guilty of killing Thoriso testified, together with their parents, in mitigation of the sentence. Two other teens who were found guilty of common assault after admitting to slapping Themane and kicking him out of their car and two adults, Chuene Maleka and Alfred Mothapo, who were found guilty of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, were also present in court. Themane was attacked by a group of teenagers in Fauna Park, Polokwane, on 23 February 2019 and died in hospital the next day. The pre-sentencing proceeded according to the Child Justice Act as the offence was committed when they were under 18 years. The accused asked the court to allow them to continue with their studies while outside prison. Teffo told the court: “I would want a punishment that would not disturb my studies.” During cross-examination, Advocate Mashudu Mudau said he would ask the court to send Teffo to prison so he could be rehabilitated. His mum Lucy described him as someone who was quiet. Mothemela said he felt sorry for the Themane family as they had lost a loved one. “I showed remorse as I spoke to Thoriso’s father about the incident before I got arrested. I would like a suspended sentence,” he said. Myeni said he thought about the case all the time. “I don’t want to go to prison as there are bad people there,” he said. His mum, Eunice, said Tshiamo was not a troublesome boy. But Advocate Mudau said he deserves to go to prison. Ramokgopa told the court that all he wanted was his brother’s cap. Hesaid he wished for a sentence of house arrest. Advocate Mudau said this was a serious offence and the accused could be sentenced to 25 years. Sentencing is expected today, 29 June.
