THE ANC is yet to deliberate on the criminal charges opened against President Cyril Ramaphosa by former correctional services commissioner Arthur Fraser. They are related to a robbery at his Limpopo farm, where it has been alleged that millions, in foreign currency, were stolen. Briefing the media on the state of readiness of the Limpopo elective conference outside Polokwane, party spokesman Pule Mabe said the national executive committee or national working committee would be the appropriate structure to discuss the charges. Mabe confirmed that the provincial executive committee was still locked in a meeting to discuss issues related to credentials, which would determine voting delegates. He further revealed that the meeting went until late last night and there were issues still to be ironed out, but he was confident the conference would continue without any disruptions or violent incidents. He played the deployment of tight security of police and private security personnel at the venue, saying these measures were put in place to ensure that people were accredited. “Security around ANC conferences also have to do with matters of access control because you want to make sure the conference precinct, venue of delegates, media and guests are accredited,” Mabe said. The conference is already hours behind schedule on its first day and according to one official in the organising team Keith Khoza, when it starts it might have to go straight into nominations. It is understood that the meeting was seized with the matter of legal court interdict against the conference, even though some reports suggested that the matter was exhausted by the same structure on Thursday. Mabe promised that once the committee had resolved outstanding issues, NEC deployee Thoko Didiza would give an update.
