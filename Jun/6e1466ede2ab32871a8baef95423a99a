FLOOD victims who are tired of being left out in the cold and wet stormed the Durban City Hall on Monday, 6 June. The angry residents from Clermont, KwaMashu and Ntuzuma, called on the city to make some of its vacant buildings available or look at housing projects where they could be housed until a permanent solution was found. The group of about 60 had planned to spend the night at the City Hall as it was warm. They said living in community halls had become unbearable. They were speaking to deputy mayor Philani Mavundla. Thabani Msomi (34) said some were sharing spaces with kids. “Kids end up being exposed to inappropriate behaviour. There have been instances where people have sex, exposing them to such.” He said they had been displaced for almost two months, yet there was no change. “Some buildings in Durban are vacant. Instead of people living in these halls that get flooded, they should be allowed to live there.” Mavundla said housing concerns of flood victims had nothing to do with the municipality, so provincial and national government must deal with it. He said the city was in talks with MEC for human settlement Jomo Sibiya to find a solution. “The city has provided a hall and opened soup kitchens. Beyond that, there’s nothing we can do.”
