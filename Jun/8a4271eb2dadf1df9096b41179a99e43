We published the article headlined “PUNANI DANCER HITS OUT!” on 10 June 2022. We quoted Frans Machele, owner of Funky Inn, in the article but he denied speaking to the journalist. We have two voice notes in our possession of a male voice that was quoted in the article and a voice note of Machele we received after the article was published. It’s two different voices, and it is evident that we were duped. We apologise to Machele for attributing the comments in the article to him. We retract the comments attributed to him in the article.
