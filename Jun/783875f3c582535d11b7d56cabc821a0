A MAN and a woman were killed after a bakkie and a light motor vehicle collided head-on on the N12 between Fochville and Westonaria in Gauteng on Tuesday, 28 June. Another man was injured during the crash. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said medics arrived at the scene at about 6.12pm to find the wrecked bakkie and smouldering car in the middle of the road. “Upon closer inspection, medics found a man and woman lying in the front of the car. Another man was found lying on the side of the road. “Medics assessed the patients and found that the two inside the car had already succumbed to their injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead,” Meiring said. He said a man was found on the side of the road with severe injuries. “Medics treated the man and later transported him to a private hospital for further care. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations,” Meiring said.
