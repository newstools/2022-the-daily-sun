It is reported that the man, from Los Angeles in the USA, is heading to New Zealand in the hope of adding more babies to his list. READ: How to donate sperm in Mzansi! Women reportedly get in contact with Gordy through his social media accounts to ask for his services. He then donates his sperm by insemination as well as the natural way – having sex with the client. Speaking to the Herald, Gordy said women often paid him $1 700 (around R26 000) to book him a flight to donate his sperm. He said he found it hard to date women as they didn’t want him in his 20s. “I realised that doing this was probably the only way I could have children of my own. And I thought it was more ethical than a sperm bank because at a bank, you don’t know who you’re going to get your sperm from,” he said. According to Los Angeles magazine, Gordy has been donating his sperm for about eight years, and stays in contact with families he has helped get pregnant.
