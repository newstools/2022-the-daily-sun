FROM a young age, Kagiso Domingos has been obsessed with figuring out how things worked and how to make them better. The 34-year-old from Ledig Village, outside Rustenburg in North West, who is now an inventor, believes he can change the world through his inventions. He told Daily Sun that it made him proud to know that his inventions have the potential to help people. Kagiso invented a mobile power station that has the potential to bring much-needed electricity to people and provide relief during load shedding. The power station can power household items such as TVs, cellphones and lights. It uses a solar system that’s also connected to a battery that charges itself on rainy days.  “The power station is user friendly. Unlike a generator, it does make any sound. It’s foldable.I’ve been using the power station during the recent power cuts. “Load shedding does not affect me that much because I can switch on the lights, watch TV and charge my phone. “My dream is to develop the device and for it to be used all over the world. Kagiso added that his goal is to ensure that the power station is able to power bigger appliances and is used in industries, hospitals, schools and companies. “I am working on a bigger station with a high-powered system. My biggest challenge has been funding as I’m unemployed. I hope to get sponsors to help me pursue my dreams,” he said.
