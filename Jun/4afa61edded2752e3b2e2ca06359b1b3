THE RESPECTED gogo had just retired from a lifetime of teaching and deserved a well-earned rest. But her son changed all of that when he allegedly murdered her because she wouldn’t buy him a car. HER HEAD AND LEGS WERE CUT OFF AND STUFFED INTO A PLASTIC BAG! The residents of Riverside in Phuthaditjhaba, Free State, were shocked by the horrific murder of the gogo (62). According to the gogo’s husband and father of the suspect, he came home on Tuesday, 7 June, to find his son in the garage allegedly pushing his mum’s body parts into a plastic bag. And when the father asked what was going on, he allegedly stabbed him in the chest. Resident Teboho Mofokeng said: “I have never seen anything like this. I never thought anybody could be so cruel as to kill his own mother, and cut her body parts into pieces.” He said he thought it was the right time for parliament to talk about the death penalty. “History will judge us for allowing this kind of brutal crime. Criminals are fearless to kill because our prisoners live in luxury while the lives of victims don’t matter. The person who did this deserves the death penalty,” said Mofokeng. The gogo’s brother said she was a woman of integrity. “She did not deserve to die like this. She was killed by the person who was supposed to protect her,” he said, adding that she had recently retired from teaching. “The suspect smokes drugs. He used to joke that his dream was to kill his mother. Now the dream has come true. We are devastated and want justice.” Captain Phumelelo Dlamini said the son fled the scene after allegedly stabbing his father, who was admitted to hospital. “A case of murder and attempted murder is being investigated, and the suspect is still at large,’ said Dlamini. He described the suspect as 1,5m tall with natural hair, no beard and slender in shape. He was last seen wearing a striped T-shirt and black jeans.
