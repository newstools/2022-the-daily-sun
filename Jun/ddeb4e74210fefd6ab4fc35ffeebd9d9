THE national shutdown over fuel hikes started on a bad note in some parts of Durban, KZN. This because some residents woke up at the crack of dawn and attempted to loot shops and stalls within the CBD. But as cops were alert and ready for any possible looting and crime, they acted fast. They had to fire tear gas and stun grenades during the attempt. In another incident in Hammarsdale, residents also stormed nearby shops, but cops dispersed the crowd.
