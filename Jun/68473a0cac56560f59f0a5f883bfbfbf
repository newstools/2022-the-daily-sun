THE family of the teacher who was brutally murdered and cut into pieces has condemned allegations that the husband, who was stabbed allegedly by their son, has died. The SunTeam spoke to the 65-year-old husband and father, who was discharged from Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli Regional Hospital on Saturday, 11 June. “I am recovering well at home and preparing a dignified funeral for my innocent wife. I find it irritating to hear misleading rumours about me,” he said. He said they had put everything in the hands of the police. “We welcome the arrest of the suspect,” he said. The teacher (62) will be laid to rest at her home in Riverside, QwaQwa in the Free State, on Saturday, 18 June. The suspect was found in the garage, allegedly stuffing the remains of his mother in a plastic bag, on 6 June. His father was stabbed when he asked what the suspect was doing. The accused appeared in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court on Friday, 10 June on charges of murder and attempted murder. The case has been postponed to 21 June. Members of the ANC Women’s League in Thabo Mofutsanayana visited the family on Monday, 13 June. Chairwoman Masetjhaba Mosia-Lakaje told the media that Parliament should start a robust debate on the death penalty. “We want Parliament to make serious changes to our criminal laws. The perpetrators of gender-based violence must know the death penalty will be back in our Constitution. Our intention is to make petitions to Parliament and the Judiciary,” she said.
