THE youth of 1976 laid down their lives to stand against the apartheid regime. But today’s youth are fighting a different fight, which is drugs. So on Thursday, June 16, pupils from Leondale Secondary School in Joburg will march to highlight the drug problem in their kasi. Joined by their parents and the School Governing Body (SGB), the pupils will march to address the prevalence of drug use in the school and denounce the ongoing drug trade on the school grounds. They allege that the drugs sold at the school come from the Leondale community and surrounding areas. “Drug lords are targeting unsuspecting pupils,” said one of the pupils. Leondale secondary made headlines last month after pupils were caught on camera smoking dagga on the school premises. The video went viral, prompting Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi to take action against the pupils involved. The school governing body chairman, Sidwell Mofokeng, said pupils have provided information about those selling drugs in the kasi. “With this march, we are sending messages that we are coming for them. Some of the pupils who featured in the notorious video will lead the march on 16 June. “The march could see a true rekindling of the fearless revolutionary spirit of the 1976 youth in today’s generation of young people who are faced with a different monster called drugs. We urge communities at large to support the fight against the new enemy,” said Mofokeng. Two of the pupils who were in the viral video will lead the day’s programme and share solutions at the end of the march. One of the pupils said: “We are not proud about what happened and we will be participating in the march to discourage other pupils from smoking drugs.” The march will also be used to call on the Department of Education and organisations active in drug use prevention to help the school develop ongoing, effective sustainable drug education policies and anti-substance abuse awareness programmes.
