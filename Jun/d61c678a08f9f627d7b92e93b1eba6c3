SABC2 drama series, Muvhango, celebrated its 25th birthday on Saturday, 25 June in Venda, Limpopo. Before enjoying a gala dinner at the Kalahari Waterfront, the cast and crew went to Thavhani Mall where they were welcomed by dancers. The show’s creator, Dr Duma Ndlovu, took to the podium to express his gratitude to their supporters, the Venda community, the cast and crew. He said he was happy the show – which started in 1997 – is moving back from Joburg to its home ground in Venda, where it belongs. Lesley Musina, who played Ndalamo from 2014 to 2017, told Daily Sun he learnt a lot from the directors and Dr Ndlovu. “I came through during the peak in 2014, that’s when we got the highest viewership and at some point when I was still there we had a viewership of six million. So, I’m grateful to have been part of the show as this is the show that literally launched me. It put me on the map.” The CEO of Word of Mouth productions, Mandla kaNozulu, said: “It has been an honour to see this child grow as it started as a 13 episode series and now it has grown. We are hoping for another 25 years.” Gabriel Temudzani, who’s played Chief Azwindini since 2000, said his 20 years with the show had taught him a lot of positivity and growth. “I started with the show in 2000 when I was still in matric. Moving from Venda to Joburg was such a huge transition for me, but it’s something I loved as I had never been to Joburg before,” he said.
