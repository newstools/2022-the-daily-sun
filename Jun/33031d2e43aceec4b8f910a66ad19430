TO COMMEMORATE Youth Day, Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, head of department Ntsiki Sisulu, and Department of Correctional Services officials held a dialogue between pupils and inmates in Tshwane on Wednesday, 15 June. The dialogue was between pupils from Gatang Secondary School and DR WF Nkomo High School and inmates from Baviaanspoort Correctional Centre. The programme started with a dialogue on safety issues and ended with a tour at the facility. The Department of Community Safety said the tour was used as a platform to encourage young inmates to work closely with law enforcement authorities during their rehabilitation. Northern Corridor official of the prison, Frans Sema, said the purpose of the session was to expose the youth to life in correctional facilities to deter them from erratic and delinquent behaviour. “In addition, we want to give young inmates an opportunity to make amends and build resilience,” he said. Sisulu, who was facilitating the dialogue session, said most smart young people find themselves in conflict with the law because they believe they could get away with murder through their intelligence. Mazibuko encouraged the young offenders to advise the pupils that there was no good or soft life in prison. While sharing their stories, an inmate said he has learnt a lot being in prison. He said he learnt that it was not shameful to ask for help. “Stay away from drugs and make your parents proud,” he said. Another offender urged the pupils to take care of themselves. He told them that prison was not nice. One of the pupils said she has learnt a lot from the inmates. “We got to see that prison is not child’s play, and we need to be serious about life,” she said.
