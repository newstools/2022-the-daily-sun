SHE had a sugar daddy who ruined her life. Now she wants to warn teenagers about sugar daddies as all she’s left with is a baby, HIV and an empty bank account. The 23-year-old said she wanted to speak out as she had noticed that having a sugar daddy had become the norm at Ramaphosa squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. “I met the sugar daddy at a pub and grill when I was 17 years old. He was very generous with money and used it to attract me,” she said. A year later, her sugar daddy made her sell drugs at school. “He was doing everything for me, so I agreed. He also promised to raise my allowance from R5 000 to R7 000,” she said. “I was tired of living at home and moved to Maboneng. I obviously stopped going to school and partied almost every night.” Life was great until she fell pregnant at 21 and her sugar daddy told her he was against abortion. “The man disappeared. When I called him, his phone was off and I thought he maybe changed numbers,” she said. “He stopped sending me money and paying my rent. I had no choice but to go back home.” The woman said when she went to the clinic for her a check-up, she discovered she was HIV-positive. “I was so devastated because this is the only man I’ve ever been with,” she said. Things only got worse as her mum then died. “If I had listened to my mum, I’d be in university, living without HIV and wouldn’t have a child,” she said. “My only source of income is my child’s grant.”
