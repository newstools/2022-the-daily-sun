AN additional booster dose is being offered to people over the age of 50. National Department of Health spokesman Foster Mohale said they had updated vaccination schedules and people who fell in this age category would be eligible to receive an additional booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine. “This additional booster is available to people in this age group who have gone for 120 days or four months since they received their last Covid-19 vaccination of either Pfizer or J&J,” he said. “This is part of efforts to increase vaccine uptake to achieve population immunity while protecting the most vulnerable groups, especially those living with comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. Mohale said the Pfizer vaccine had proven to be safe and effective for boosting immunity in older persons who remained at highest risk of severe disease and death from Covid-19. “We applaud older people for coming forward in large numbers and we encourage all individuals who have not had their second dose or booster dose to go to their nearest vaccination site.” Mohale said the department, in collaboration with health organisations such as Right to Care, had launched the app FindMyJab.co.za, which would make it easier for anyone to find the closest vaccination site using devices such as smartphones, laptops and tablets.
