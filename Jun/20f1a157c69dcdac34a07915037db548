Nelson
Mandela's grandson, Mbuso Mandela (30), is expected to appear in the Alexandra
magistrates court on Wednesday, 29 June. He is
facing counts of possession of an unlicensed firearm and drugs. He was
arrested at his apartment in Morningside, north of Joburg, after the police
received a tip-off from his landlord who stopped the men in blue during a
routine patrol in the neighbourhood after complaints from other tenants. His
brother, Ndaba Mandela, came to his rescue and paid his R1000 bail. Ndaba
tweeted after Mbuso was released on 6 May: "Bailed my brother out this
morning. Been telling him 4 years now to watch the company he keeps... Can't do
time for other people's kak! Hope the penny really dropped this time." This is not
the first time Mbuso has had a brush with the law. In 2015, he
was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl at the Mamma’s Shebeen restaurant
and bar in Greenside. The case
was later withdrawn in the Johannesburg magistrates court.
