VILLAGERS were over the moon when the R81 Road was reconstructed in 2019. They believed it would bring an end to truck crashes and boost the local economy. However, residents of Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, now fear the road, which passes through the village, is becoming a death trap once again. On 21 May, there was an accident involving a 30-year-old man and on Saturday, 18 June a 39-year-old pedestrian was run over. Residents said they were worried that there would be more deaths as many motorists ignored the rules of the road, especially at night. They are calling on the government to install traffic lights. Resident Nakedi Mafa (40) told Daily Sun: “We need serious intervention as soon as possible before we lose more lives.” Villagers said the road had stop signs but they were not useful at night. “Motorists pass through without stopping, although they are visible,” said Nakedi. Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mamphaswa Seabi confirmed that a 39-year-old man was hit by a car on Saturday night. “His body was discovered on Sunday morning,” he said. Transport department spokesman Mike Maringa said they had noted the accidents involving pedestrians with concern. “We call on motorists to be on the lookout for pedestrians crossing the roads. We urge them to reduce speed, observe the rules of the road and urge pedestrians to always wear visible clothes,” he said. Sanral spokesman, Vusi Mona, said engineers had been sent to assess the road to determine what action to take.
