RESIDENTS of Marikana informal settlements near Soutpan road,Tshwane, have vowed to continue protesting until their demands are heard. On Tuesday, 7 June, the fuming residents said for more than 10 years they’ve been waiting for services such as water and electricity. They said they felt City of Tshwane was taking them for granted. Resident Dimakatso Nguxa said they were struggling with water, and that the whole community had only two JoJo tanks that didn’t cover everyone. “We’re going to continue closing this road until those who are in power come to us. We’re gatvol of being ignored and if it means a protest will get us what we want, so be it,” she said. She said this was their second day of protesting and that no one has addressed them. Another resident, Andrew Buta, said they had been fighting for too long and it was clear the city wasn’t taking them seriously. He said their lives were in danger because people resorted to connecting izinyoka, and several kids in the area have lost their lives. Another resident, William Chauke, said previously when they protested, MMC for Human Settlement Abel Tau promised to take their matter to the council. He said they were surprised when they were told the city had zero budget for Marikana. Ward councillor Sonia Mabolawa said it wasn’t good seeing kids not being able to go to school due to a protest. Mabolawa said the concerns raised by residents were being attended to. City spokesman Sipho Stuurman said they were still waiting for the MMC to respond to the inquiry sent. At the time of going to print, no feedback was received. Daily Sun tried to get hold MMC Tau, but his phone was off.
