THE Gardee and Mashiyane families, who are related, feel that bad luck keeps following them. This after their daughters Hillary Gardee (28), the daughter of former EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee, and Bontle Mashiyane (6) were found dead last month. Bontle’s great-grandmother and Hillary’s great-grandfather are siblings, making them the great-granddaughters of the Mazibane family. Norman Mazibane (47), who is Bontle’s grandfather, told Daily Sun Hillary and Bontle disappeared in the same month. He said although different suspects have been arrested for the murders, the fear of who might be next in the family is mounting.  “We are asking ourselves if we did something wrong or if this is some sort of punishment for our families. “What happened is terrible for the Mazibane family,” he said. Asked if his family suspected they might be targeted, Godrich said he didn’t have much to say. “I think only God has an answer to what happened, only God knows,” he said.

Sipho Mkhatshwa (39), Philemon Lukhele (47) and Mduduzi Gama (52) were charged with rape, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition as well as defeating the ends of justice. Bontle was also reported missing on 30 April. Her mutilated body was found weeks later, dumped not far from her home. Five people, including an inyanga and her neighbours, have been arrested for her murder.  Traditional healer Madoda Ntuli said if such incidents happen in a family, it means someone was killed and there was never any cleansing. “This might be a generational curse and that person who was killed before will come back and haunt the family by targeting other family members, killing them in the same manner. The whole family must be cleansed. They must put a stop to it because if they don’t, this will continue,” he said.
