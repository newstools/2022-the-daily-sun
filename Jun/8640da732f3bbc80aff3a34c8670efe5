FOLLOWING the incident where babies were allegedly switched at a Durban hospital, the KZN Department of Health says disciplinary measures will be taken against implicated staff members. The babies were switched three weeks ago at the Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi. One of them died while the other was still alive. But the death was not related to the switching. A young mother allegedly went back home with a baby that wasn’t hers. A week later, she was contacted and told to bring back the baby. Then she was told her baby had died, and that the one she had taken home belonged to someone else. Spokesman Mdu Ncalane said the department was concerned about the matter, and saddened by the death of the baby. He added that the matter had been investigated and disciplinary measures taken against implicated staff. He further said it was being treated with due care and sensitivity as both parents were under the age of 18. ALSO READ |

He said the hospital had offered counselling to both parties, but this was delayed due to their need to focus on their studies as they were busy with exams. ALSO READ |
HOSPITAL HORROR: Family wants R15m “The results of the first DNA tests were communicated with both mothers and their families. On request by the mother of the deceased, we have conducted a second DNA test, and the results are due on 21 June.” Ncalane added that it was important to note that the hospital delivered between 1 100 and 1 400 babies every month, the second-highest in the country, and it was among those hardest hit by floods, that occurred around the same time as the alleged incident.
