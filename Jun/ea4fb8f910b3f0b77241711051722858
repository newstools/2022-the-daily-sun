CITY of Joburg Emergency Management Services said they’re committed to finding the remains of the missing Khanyelethu Magadla (6), who disappeared more than a week ago. “We explained to the family that the chances of finding him alive are very slim and the family understands,” said Emergency Management Services spokesman, Robert Mulaudzi. “The family said they’d appreciate it if we find his body. We’ve made a commitment to them that we’ll use every resource we have, including technology to explore the area where we might locate Khayalethu.” Khayalethu is believed to have slipped and fallen into a manhole on Sunday, 12 June. The boy was playing soccer with his friends a few metres away from his home in Dlamini, Soweto when the incident happened. The search to locate Khayalethu still continues.

He said the use of robots was carried out by technicians. “We are now exploring in the area so that when we move to the next manhole, we are certain the area is clear.” Mulaudzi said the search has taken all these days due to the nature of the environment. Earlier last week, Joburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse said the city was using alternative means to close manholes. She said that there was no record that the manhole which Khayalethu fell into had been reported as damaged.
