THREE thugs were killed and one arrested in a shoot-out with the police on Wednesday, 8 June, in Sandton, north of Joburg. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo, cops got a tip-off about suspects who were committing hijackings and armed robberies in the northern suburbs of Joburg. And at times, the thugs would use vehicles fitted with blue lights. Masondo said at about 7pm, the police and private security companies were on the look-out for the suspects when they spotted a Ford Figo hatchback with four occupants, travelling in Bramley. “They attempted to stop the vehicle, but the suspects responded by shooting at them while speeding off. A shoot-out and high-speed chase ensued. On Marlboro Drive, the suspects’ car lost control and crashed into a wall. They all jumped out and the shoot-out continued,” Masondo said in a statement. He added that three suspects were fatally wounded and one was bust on the scene. Cops also recovered three unlicensed firearms with ammunition and blue LED flash lights. “It was established that the car driven by suspects was hijacked in Bramley earlier this month. The multidisciplinary team of law enforcement agencies continues to squeeze the space for criminals in Gauteng as more are intercepted and unlicensed firearms recovered,” Masondo added.
