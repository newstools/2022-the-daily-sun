THEY had an argument on 5 April and her husband left the house on Plot 170 in Madeley Road in Boksburg North, Ekurhuleni. However, Mthandeni Sam Maduna (54) has not been seen since and his wife, Nthati (36), doesn’t know his whereabouts. She said what’s more frustrating was that he left his phone at home. “It is hard to get hold of him. I don’t know where he is, whether he is alive or not,” she said. Nthati said she and her in-laws had looked for Sam at mortuaries, hospitals and hospices. “I can’t even sleep at night thinking about him,” she said. She said that Sam has a hearing problem following an injury years ago. Nthati said her husband was last seen wearing a red tracksuit top, black trousers with yellow stripes and black boots. Cops are appealing to anyone who knows Sam’s whereabouts to contact Boksburg North police on 011 960 0100 or 071 675 6986.
