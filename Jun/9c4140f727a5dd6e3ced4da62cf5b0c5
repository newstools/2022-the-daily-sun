ERNST Middendorp fears for the worst for his former club Maritzburg United next season. He said if they don’t prepare well, they will find themselves in deeper trouble than they’ve been in the past two seasons. Maritzburg on Wednesday parted ways with Middendorp after 16 months in charge. The German tactician, who was in his fourth stint with the club, said this coming season will be like no other. He said all teams in the PSL would have to play 15 or more matches in the first half of the season before November due to the 2022 Fifa World Cup. The football showpiece kicks off on 21 November and will end on 18 December in Qatar. That would mean PSL clubs will be playing weekends and mid-week from August until the World Cup kicks off. The PSL’s schedule will be expected to complete the coming season on time as they failed to finish the past season in May, after Orlando Pirates reached the Caf Confederation Cup final. “There’s quite an interesting story and nobody is realising this for next season,” Middendorp told SunSport. “Next season will have its own character. You can’t miss anything out next season as you start on the 6 August and the entire first half, including the MTN8, must be done by 6 November. “Then, you have a block of two months off for the World Cup where nobody can play. Then (because the World Cup will end on 18 December) you will start the second round on the 7 January 2023. “This will be after a two-month break. Then there will be a Nedbank Cup and some Fifa dates (in March next year) and you have to finish the season in the middle of May because of the Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast (in June). “If you don’t have an adequate squad, if you are not prepared for this, you are in trouble. I made this clear to Maritzburg. Certain players playing Saturdays and Wednesdays can’t do it. That means you need options, you need additional players. “It’s not an issue with Mamelodi Sundowns or Pirates, but it will be an issue for certain other teams.”
