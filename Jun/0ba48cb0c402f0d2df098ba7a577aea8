TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula on Sunday, 12 June, visited the scene of the terrible crash that happened on Friday, 10 June. The crash, which happened on the M17 Hornsnek Road, outside Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane between a bus and a truck, claimed the lives of 15 people and injured many. Mbalula also visited the Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa, where other patients are still admitted. He promised to visit families of the dead people this week. “We visited the accident victims and held prayer sessions in different wards and others who are in intensive care unit,” said the minister. He said 32 people were brought to the hospital in Ga-Rankuwa and others were taken to other hospitals. He said there will be an accident report and possible prosecution after the investigation. “The report will be ready by Friday. I will release it to the public and indicate what happened, and what we will do,” he said. He said they will establish what will happen in terms of the social insurance benefits and the Road Accident Fund (RAF). “We will establish how to render services to those who are injured and the deceased,” he said. He passed condolences to the bereaved families and wished the injured a speedy recovery. He cautioned truck drivers to use national roads and not small roads to avoid accidents. Mbalula said the two drivers who are both deceased were in possession of valid South African licenses. RAF chief executive officer, Collins Letsoalo, said: “Our role is to offer injury and death benefits. “Any driver who could be found to be at fault will not be covered by RAF. Only victims will be covered.” He said there are injury benefits. “RAF only pays when there are serious injuries which will be determined by medical service providers,” he said. Tshwane Acting District Commissioner Tshwane, Brigadier Samuel Thine said police were still investigating the accident.
