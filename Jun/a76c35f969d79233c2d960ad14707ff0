A TRACKING company’s employee was ambushed and killed while tracking a stolen vehicle in Samora Machel in Cape Town on Wednesday afternoon, 22 June. Two vehicles from a tracking company responded to a report about a stolen car in Kosovo Squatter Camp, Samora Machel. The tracking company employees were driving two vehicles, a Ford and a Polo. When they arrived at the area where the tracker was located, they split and went to different directions as they searched the place. According to a source that spoke to Daily Sun, when the team that was driving the Polo was about to arrive where the stolen car was, several bullets were fired in their direction and one person was killed. Residents who witnessed the incident said they saw the alleged shooters running in between the shacks with firearms in their hands. “These people stole a car and parked it in between shacks and waited for anyone who would come and fetch the car. “We always see cars abandoned but this is the first time I have seen tracking company people being shot at,” said a woman who sells vegetables close to where the incident took place.
