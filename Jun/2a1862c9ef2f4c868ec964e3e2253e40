WHEN his son returned from rehab in 2021, See Maledi thought he was starting a new life. But now the 72-year-old from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, is desperate as his son is stealing his belongings to sell for drugs. He told Daily Sun he didn’t know what to do with his 33-year-old son any more. “He is selling everything in the house, including my clothes. I did everything in my power to get him help but he’s just getting worse every day.” See said his son sold the beds, oven, stove and fridge. “I heard some of the things were sold to our neighbours. “I don’t know how they buy things from my son. “My house used to be beautiful but now it’s empty. “I don’t know what to do any more,” he said. See said his son was a good child who did well at school until he got into drugs. “We took him to rehab and we hoped he would get his act together but he’s back on drugs,” he said. See said he tried to report his son to the police but he was told there was no evidence he stole from the house. His son refused to speak to Daily Sun. Gauteng Social Development spokesman Motsamai Motlhaolwa said they would send social workers to assess madala See’s situation.
