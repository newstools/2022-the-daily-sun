THE mass exodus of players from clubs in the PSL continues. And it seems the recent trend in the top-flight has now spilt over to the second tier. This after GladAfrica Championship side Venda Football Academy also jumped on the bandwagon, releasing a whopping 15 players. This was kicked off by clubs such as Kaizer Chiefs, AmaZulu and Sekhukhune United with others following suit as player’s contracts expire this month. Durban-based side Usuthu released 15, Sekhukhun 14, Chiefs 10, Maritzburg United eight and Stellenbosch released seven players. And now VFA have parted with 15 players as they make space for new arrivals ahead of the new season. Msawakhe Mncwango, Ranga Chivaviro, Jabulani Shongwe, MacClive Phiri, Sibusiso Mkonde, Enocent Mkhabela, Vincent Sithole, Lebo Ngubeni, and Abdoulaye Kante have all been released. The likes of Eden Nene, Tshepo Makgoga, Zwivhuya Matombo, Velile Zitha, Sibusiso Khumalo, Thembisani Nevhulamba didn’t survive the chop as they were also shown the door. “The Club would like to thank the above players for their contribution to the team and wish them all the best in their endeavours,” read a statement.
