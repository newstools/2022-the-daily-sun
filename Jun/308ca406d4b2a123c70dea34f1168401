RESIDENTS of Matlharantlheng squatter camp in Harrismith, Free State, are in shock after the discovery of a burnt body. The body of a man was found in an open field near Harrismith Airport on Tuesday, 31 May. His hands and legs were tied with a rope. It is suspected that he was killed elsewhere and dumped there. Community leader Thembi Philasande said the man is unknown to residents. “We just woke up and saw the body of a man who was burnt beyond recognition. We have a strong belief that he was killed elsewhere and dumped in our informal settlement during the night. We are really fears for our lives. We are close to the N3 highway where criminals travel, doing as they please. We hope police will leave no stone unturned in tracking down the perpetrators,” said Philasande. The area falls under Ward 5 outside Intabazwe. Ward councillor Neo Motaung said: “We are devastated with the community. The incident is horrible. I’m in talks with Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality to activate street lights so that we can see strange movements especially during the night. We want the perpetrators to be arrested as soon as possible,” said Motaung Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said inquiries were made around the vicinity without success and nobody could recognise the charred body. “A case of murder is being investigated,” said Mophiring.
