THE Mkhize family have lost everything they own in a fire and they believe it’s vutha. Members of the family from Springfield, Durban believe their family is under a spell that wants to destroy everything. Zandile (59) said when they had their first fire on 9 May they thought their youngest child accidentally threw a lit matchstick on a blanket. She said the family was preparing to go to bed when one of the children went to her bedroom and screamed that the room was on fire. Zandile said firefighters put out the fire, but at about 11pm, her husband asked her if she smelt smoke. “He went to investigate and found a second bedroom in flames. “From then on, the fire started burning random items in the house. If it wasn’t children’s school books, it was clothes and furniture,” she said. She said when they spoke about going to a sangoma, the fire became more violent and started burning different items at the same time. The fire then burnt items in their spaza shop in the yard. “One night neighbours woke us up shouting that the shop was on fire. We put out the fire, but it starts any time burning the stock.” Zandile’s husband, Dumisani (54), said it was painful seeing his family sleep outside in this cold weather because they feared the evil fire. “We fear for our lives. When we cook we find lots of unused matchsticks in the food and we are force to throw it away, “This fire is very strange. It even burns the food in the fridge. If I put my sealed beer in the fridge the fire will burn it,” he said. They appealed to any sangoma who is able to end the spell to help them. Sangoma Mkhulu Zwane said: “The family must first find out where the spell comes from before they can get rid of it.”
