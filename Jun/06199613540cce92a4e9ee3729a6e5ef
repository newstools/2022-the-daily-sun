A HUMAN-SIZED statue of IFP founder and the Zulu nation’s traditional prime minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi will be erected at the entrance of the Ingwavuma area along with a monument to preserve the history of the place. The statue will be erected by Jozini Municipality to honour Buthelezi for the role he played to stop a Swaziland takeover. The statue will be erected along with a statue of the late King Zwelithini, who supported Buthelezi during this fight for Ingwavuma land in 1982. Jozini Mayor Mfananaye Mathe said the statue will be unveiled in August. “We want to thank him for the amazing job he has done for the people of Ingwavuma, and for the work he did for the Zulu nation. “We don’t want to thank him when he is dead. He deserves to see that his work did not go unnoticed,” said Mathe. He said this was the first project aimed at preserving and upgrading tourism in Jozini. Speaking about the land issue, Buthelezi said he served as chief minister of the KZN government at the time. “Dr Piet Koornhof had announced his government’s decision in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly on 18 June 1982. “I took the issue to the Natal Supreme Court. Within less than a month, the court ruled against government, cancelling its plans. Government appealed the ruling, but the Appeals Court in Bloemfontein upheld the Supreme Court’s decision,” he said. Buthelezi said King Zwelithini supported his actions.
