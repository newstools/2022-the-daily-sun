THE African National Congress (ANC) in the North West has dismissed as mere rumours threats of a court challenge to interdict its elective conference. Party spokesman Kenny Morolong told Daily Sun the province has not received any court papers with the intention to stop the conference that is scheduled to start next Thursday. The province has since 2019 been trying to hold elective conferences to elect new leadership but each time they have been postponed. Morolong said this time it was all systems go. However, the interim provincial committee (IPC) is yet to receive a report on the state of finalisation of disputes lodged by branch members. Morolong could not give the exact number of branches in good standing, saying only the reports which are to be handed to the committee on Tuesday evening, 14 June, will give a proper picture of how ready the province is. The provincial dispute resolution committee is also expected to give its report to the committee overseeing the preparations. So far, it was not clear whether the threats were coming from supporters of former premier and provincial chairman Supra Mahumapelo, who has launched a bid to get his job back. The conference is expected to be a contest between Premier Bushy Maape, former ANC Youth League leader Kenetswe Mosenoge, finance MEC Matlalepula Rosho and IPC co-ordinator Hlomani Chauke. It has not yet emerged who is the clear favourite as verification of branches is still not complete. Morolong could not even reveal which of the candidates had met the threshold in the branch nominations, saying disputes still had to be addressed. There still exists a possibility that some of the branches could be ordered to have a re-run of Biannual Branch General Meetings which could change the complexion of the numbers.
