MATENASI has gone viral on social media, and Mzansi is loving him. The young man, from Tshwane, has been trending following his videos, where he performs with a bacardi song on the background. He ensures that he respects his teachers by focusing in the classroom, but ziyakhala come break time. In one video, his friend asks him to do a mini performance in the classroom but he refuses to disturb the lesson, and promises to dance during break. Some said even though his dance moves were not polished, they loved his energy and were hoping that he would prosper. “I just hope all this newfound fame won’t distract Matenasi. He looks like a good kid,” said Londiwe Mthethwa. Then Gugu Ntakelo said kids were really living their best lives in school as every time a new video was trending, the content would be from pupils. “I love this for them, and I hope they pass at the end of the day,” said Gugu. Thato Mokoena said Matenasi’s dance moves gave him hope that he could do better. “You can see he’s having fun without any stress. He doesn’t care if you love his dance moves or not. He’s living his best life,” said Thato.
