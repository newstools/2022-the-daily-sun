A MAN drowned while praying in a river in Kriel, Mpumalanga, on 13 June. His body was finally retrieved from the river by police divers on Saturday, 25 June. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said: “On 13 June, a local pastor in Kriel, together with a certain man are said to have gone to the river stream to pray. However, the man somehow fell in the water and drowned.” Although the matter was reported to the authorities, Mohlala said his body could not be recovered by members of the police diving unit, who did all they could to find him. “The search for the man continued for days without any success until the divers finally retrieved his body on Saturday. “The man has since been identified as Eric Tshifhiwa Phaswane (43) from Thubelihle in Kriel. Police have opened an inquest case following the sad incident,” he said. Mpumalanga Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has urged members of the public to take precautions whenever they go to dams, streams, rivers and lakes. “The incident is unfortunate and regrettable,” said Manamela. “We therefore request community members to think twice before going closer to rivers or dams for whatever reason as this might place their lives at risk,” she said.
