FORMER president Jacob Zuma will today respond to the state capture report that has recommended that he be further criminally investigated. The Jacob Zuma Foundation on Friday, 24 June, issued a press alert announcing that the former president would respond to the findings at a press conference on Saturday in Sandton, Joburg. Commission chairman Chief Justice Raymond Zondo made damning findings against Zuma in his final report, on how his close relationship with the controversial Gupta family benefited them with government contracts worth billions of rands. “Zuma enabled, indirectly, members of the Gupta family as businesspeople to occupy a place of prominence over other businessmen, to the detriment of the empowerment legislative imperative of the Republic of South Africa,” he stated. Zuma was summoned to testify before the commission but on the first day, his lawyers argued that he had been tricked to come before it. They argued that he was willing to help the commission get to the bottom of the truth about state capture, but were not happy with the lining of questions. That subsequently led to a legal wrangling between Zuma and Zondo as he applied to have the chief justice recuse himself. Eventually, Zuma was found guilty of contempt of court and sentenced to 15 months in jail, but released on medical parole. This afternoon, Zuma is expected to lay down his plan of action against the report.
