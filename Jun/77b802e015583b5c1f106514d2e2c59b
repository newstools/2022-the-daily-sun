MAKHADZI, who is known for producing hits, is now taking her music abroad. She recently released a gig guide showing a string of her international performances starting from next month to August. Her first stop will be Toronto, followed by Ottawa in Canada. She will then perform in Birmingham and finish off in London in the UK. In her social media posts, she wrote: “My UK and Canada tour. This is not just a tour but a dream come true. “Performing outside of my comfort zone means a lot. UK and Canada, are you guys ready to change gears in style?” Her fans from abroad couldn’t be happier and they assured her that they will be attending her events. James Castro wrote: “We can’t wait for you here in the UK. I live in the City of Reading but I will fly to London for you, African Queen.” Robert commented: “We can’t wait to see you here in the UK. I’m from London, so I will definitely attend your gig Makhadzi.” Letticiah Polaoh said: “Makhadzi, you are following in the footsteps of legends such as Bra Hugh and Miriam Makeba. They used to tour countries like the USA, UK and others. Continue to shine, Khazi Khazi.”
