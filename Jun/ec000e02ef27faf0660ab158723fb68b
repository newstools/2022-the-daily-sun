LUCIA Mahandule was settling down with her amazing new boyfriend, but she ignored the red flags and now she’s paid the price. She had to face reality after he allegedly stole her valuables worth R90 000 and disappeared. Lucia Mahandule (38) from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun the man made her think he was ready to settle down, but now she needs help to find him so that she could get her belongings back. Lucia said she met this man on a Facebook in April. They had great virtual conversations and when they decided to meet, for safety reasons she invited him to her house. The guy, who said he was from Kempton Park, kept visiting and last month he started visiting her every day. He even drove her and her friend to the gym every afternoon. Last week, he visited her and he slept over for three days. On Wednesday, 25 May, he took her to work and she forgot to take her house keys. When she phoned him, he said he would bring them. But at about 2pm she called him again and he said he’d leave the keys under the carpet as he was busy. After work she went straight home to find a horrible surprise. Among other things, three plasma TVs, two tablets, new kitchen appliances and anything new was gone. When she called him, his phone was off and that’s when she knew he had played her. It appears this isn’t the first time the man has played this evil trick. A woman from Daveyton said the same man stole her car and she has never seen him since. Lucia did her own investigation and found that the man never stays in the same place for long.  Daily Sun phoned the man, who calls himself Sibusiso Blessing Mhlongo. He hung up as soon as the reporter introduced herself. The People’s Paper knows his real name. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant colonel Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun that a case of theft has been opened and is under investigation.
