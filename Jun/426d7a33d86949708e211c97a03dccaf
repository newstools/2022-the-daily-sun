FAKE cop tried taking his chances with unsuspecting woman at
an Alberton’s Bracken City shopping centre. He asked the woman for money, claiming that in exchange, he
will erase all her traffic fines as he is JMPD inspector. But little did he know that the woman he was speaking was
actually and real off duty cop. JMPD spokesman said that the 42-year-old male suspect was
arrested after impersonating a police officer. Fihla said, “On Tuesday 07 June 2022 an off duty
Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officer who is currently on
maternity leave was approached by a male claiming to be a JMPD Inspector
working at the Langlaagte Testing Station. "The suspect asked the off duty officer for money to
purchase oil to fix his vehicle, and in return he would cancel the officer's
traffic fines, not knowing that he was actually communicating with a JMPD
officer.” Fihla said after attempts of getting assistance as the
suspect was waiting for the officer next to her vehicle, two officers from the
Ekhuruleni Metropolitan Police Department (EMPD) Specialized Task Team came to
her rescue. The suspect was immediately apprehended. READ: Beware of fake cops on the road! “When questioned, the suspect alleged that he calls himself
an Inspector from JMPD in efforts to scam money from unsuspecting victims. He
also mentioned that he does this at least twice a week at Braken City Shopping
Centre and at The Glen Shopping Centre. “The JMPD management welcomes this arrest and applauds the
two EMPD officers for stepping up to assist the off duty JMPD officer and
saving unsuspecting victims from the scammer,” Fihla said.
