THE families of Sibusiso Phetla and Jerome Lebaka are appealing to the public to help find them. Jerome (41) and Sibusiso (39) from Lotus Gardens in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, were last seen on 13 February when they left for Thaba Tshwane to collect some cash. Their families suspect they might have been killed. Sibusiso’s mum, Merriam (59), said after he went missing, she spoke to a taxi driver who had transported the two on the night of their disappearance. “He told me they got lost and found themselves in Salvokop, near the military base, and they were assaulted by men wearing military uniform. He said my son and his friend were put in the boot of a car and after driving for a bit, the men stopped to assault them again.” Jerome’s sister, Mmathabo (32), said his girlfriend was pregnant and the whole family was struggling to cope. The taxi driver told the SunTeam he was also allegedly slapped by the men in uniform before being told to leave. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said the two were allegedly attacked by three suspects, who were nabbed. He appealed to anyone with information to come forward. Attempts to get comment from the South African National Defence Force were fruitless.
