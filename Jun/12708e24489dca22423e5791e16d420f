TWO or more referred acute patients have to wait for at least a day or two to get a bed at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital at any given time. This is according to Gauteng health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi, responding to questions from the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Gauteng legislature. She said infrastructure challenges reduced the Joburg hospital’s cardiology critical care unit from 10 to six beds. “The province only has four state cardiology departments. This is not enough to meet the needs of the people of Gauteng,” she said. Mokgethi said the cardiology unit needed eight new electronic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds as the ones currently in use were at the end of their life. “There is also a need for six new cardiac monitors and two new mobile suction units. A new central station is also needed to better monitor patients in the facility,” she said. Mokgethi said these critical needs were included in the 2022/2023 demand plan for procurement. The DA’s Jack Bloom said doctors were feeling hopeless as they were losing patients who could have been saved with proper staff and equipment.
