L’VOVO Derrango says he is grateful to be alive – and has vowed to fight against being wheelchair-bound. The kwaito star, whose real name’s Thokozani Ndlovu, was taken to hospital in May after being involved in an accident when driving towards his home town of Newcastle, KZN. The Bayang’sukela hitmaker was badly injured and ended up in ICU. He is still in hospital but he is out of ICU. “My back and hip were badly injured. I can’t walk on my own at this stage, but I thank God and my ancestors for saving my life,” he said. He said doctors were helping him to learn to walk again. “Doctors are working very hard. They are making sure that I can walk on my own again. I can’t allow myself to be in a wheelchair. I still have a lot to offer as an artist and young man. “Though I’m still in hospital, my condition is not critical. But I’m still getting physiotherapy,” he said.

I’d be lying if I said it’s easy. “It’s hard but surviving that accident made me believe that I still have work to do on Earth. That’s why I’m fighting every day.” This was the second accident for L’vovo in two years. In 2020, he was involved in another one in Scottburgh, where he suffered head injuries.
