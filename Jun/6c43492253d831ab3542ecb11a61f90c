WHEN Richard Nkosi was shot 16 times in 2004, he thought his life was over. But the 59-year-old from Swalala Village, outside White River in Mpumalanga, has used his experience as a wheelchair user to help others in the same situation. The SunHero started the Sibasitabonke Disabled Centre in 2015 and officially registered it in 2019. The centre is mobile as Richard goes to houses on a quad bike, and has helped more than 100 people. Richard said after he was shot, angels came down and he heard God’s voice telling him he needed to be saved so he could help other people. Richard said hewas admitted to hospital for more than two months. “As I was recovering, a message came from God telling me to help everyone who needed it, especially the disabled,” he said. “I didn’t understand because I thought my life was over but it was just the beginning,” he said. Richard said after he was discharged, he went around looking for temporary work and he managed to raise money for a quad bike. He said his moving centre turned heads and had got him into trouble with the cops. “I am always in trouble with the authorities but then I make them understand that I am doing the Lord’s work,” . I make sure that I don’t disturb other motorists and always drive on the yellow linehe said. Richard said he helped about 20 people a day to apply for grants, get wheelchairs and access counselling services. The father of four is also housing 16 people at his home. “I am not complaining because God rescued me to help people,” he said. Maggie Mthethwa (47), who is partially blind, said Richard while she was looking for odd jobs. She said he helped her get her eyes treated and apply for a grant.
