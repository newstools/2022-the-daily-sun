ADVOCATE Malesela Teffo read an affidavit from one of the potential witnesses, which stated that the warrant of arrest in the murder of Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa was for six people not five. “Kelly Khumalo could have been arrested along with the five accused,” he told the North Gauteng High Court on Tuesday, 14 June. State prosecutor Advocate George Baloyi objected to Teffo reading out an affidavit from the lead investigator without the author of the statement authenticating the affidavit. Baloyi reminded Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela that a ruling had been made for a postponement to allow accused number five defence lawyer Advocate Zandile Mshololo to read the second docket and consult. Mshololo reminded the judge that she told the court that any application to be brought by Teffo should be done after her cross examination. She asked the judge to stop Teffo from wasting time. Teffo’s instructing attorney TT Thobane said they were opposing the postponement, saying that Sergeant Thabo Mosia, who was still under cross examination, should be called back to complete his testimony. After an agreement between the lawyers, the application for a postponement was granted. The case has been postponed to 12 July.
