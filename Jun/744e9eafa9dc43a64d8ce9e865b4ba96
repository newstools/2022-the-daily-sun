REAL estate agent Mpho Botha passed away on Friday, 27 May. The 21-year-old was one of Mzansi’s youngest and brightest agents and his first property deal was worth R18 million. But Mpho apparently struggled with anxiety and depression before joining Urban Trend Properties. He has been described as a humble young man with big dreams of enriching the lives of many people. Although details of his death and the cause have not yet been confirmed, his memorial service was held at Kingdom Academy Hall in Welkom on Thursday, 2 June.

One of his Facebook friends, Joani Johnson, said: “He was hospitalised about a month ago due to a diabetic incident and had been in a diabetic coma for a while. He has been in recovery these last few weeks, but it seems that there had been some complications after a blood transfusion.” When Daily Sun contacted Mpho’s close friend, he refused to comment. Mpho's mum Elisa Mokodutlo confirmed to Netwerk that he was in an insulin induced coma since April at Tembisa Hospital's intensive care unit.
