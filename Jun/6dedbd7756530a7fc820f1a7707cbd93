THE African National Congress (ANC) continues to defend President Cyril Ramaphosa as calls for him to step aside mount. This comes after allegations he covered up a robbery at his Phala Phala Farm in Bela Bela, Limpopo. While presenting the ANC’s policy discovery document on Thursday, 9 June, ahead of its policy conference in Joburg, NEC member David Mahlobo said those asking Ramaphosa to step aside were jumping the gun. “The matter involving comrade president has been ventilated. One of the things the president confirmed is that the matter is under investigation. We must be able to correct those who are jumping the gun, saying the president is facing criminal charges,” he said. ALSO READ |

The president is on record and the ANC is in record, nobody is above the law.” On Wednesday, 8 June, Deputy President David Mabuza was asked in the National Assembly if he was ready to take the lead if Ramaphosa had to step down. He brushed the question aside, saying the matter was not at that stage yet. Answering a question on immigration, which is discussed in the policy document, Mahlobo said the issue of foreign nationals needed to be addressed because competition with locals was causing conflict. He warned against using the plight of foreigners who had fled their own countries to advance xenophobia. However, he insisted foreign nationals needed to respect Mzansi’s laws.
