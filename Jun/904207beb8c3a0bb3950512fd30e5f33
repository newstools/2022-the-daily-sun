During the latest incident last month, city staff were injured and their vehicle was damaged. “Electricity staff were attacked and robbed of their cell phones and tools in the Philippi area. “A staff member suffered cuts on his hand, leaving him traumatised. The vehicle was damaged. The vehicle was also damaged. “On a separate occasion in Valhalla Park on the same day, a ladder was forcibly taken from a staff member while carrying out maintenance work in the area,” said Van Reenen. She said some of the problems that the staff went out to fix were caused by vandalism, theft and illegal connections. In April, municipal worker Terence Stringer died after he was injured while replacing stolen cables in the Gugulethu and Manenberg areas. ALSO READ: MUNICIPAL WORKER SHOT! Van Reenen said residents must report anyone who is seen vandalising infrastructure to the nearest police station. “We cannot allow criminals to hold our communities hostage any longer and we appeal to residents to report these perpetrators to the SAPS,” she said. “Some areas in the metro are severely impacted by incidents of electricity theft and vandalism and the electricity infrastructure in these areas often needs to be repaired and replaced. When our staff and contractors are attacked and intimidated, residents are impacted the most.”
