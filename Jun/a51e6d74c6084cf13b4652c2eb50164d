KZN police have warned people to refrain from circulating a video threatening to shut down police stations on 16 June. The video, which is circulating on social media, has therefore been condemned by the SAPS. In the video it is apparently stated that on the day people will arrive at all police stations with lockers and chains to close all cop shops in the country. KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi condemned the circulation of the video. He said in the video, which is circulating in KZN, an individual threatens to close all police stations on 16 June. “While we are aware that this is an old video, we appeal to the residents to refrain from circulating it as this will be playing into the hands of mischievous individuals who clearly want to spread panic among the community,” said Mkhwanazi. He said they wanted to reassure the residents that they won’t allow anyone to close any police station in the province and they would act decisively if any attempts were made to disrupt services offered to residents at their police stations.
