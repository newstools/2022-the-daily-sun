TWO family members were caught in the crossfire as bullets flew in Oukasie, Vuka Section in Brits, North West, on Wednesday, 8 June. Lebogang Mapande (24) died, while her 15-year-old relative is fighting for her life in hospital. Other community members were also injured during the shooting near a local school ground. They were on their way to Oukasie Community Hall for a meeting when they were shot. After the incident, residents went on the rampage and closed the streets with stones, demanding answers. Lebogang’s aunt, Mmapula (31), said they are still struggling to accept the tragedy. “I still don’t believe that Lebogang has died. I still think I will see her again. “This hurts because she left behind two children who are five and three years old,” she said. She said the family wants justice for what happened. Another aunt, Wendy (36), said she was close to the family members. ALSO
