EVENT organiser Deborah “Dee” Dlamini is gatvol with entertainer Zodwa Wabantu. She told Daily Sun that the dancer didn’t show up to her event in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. This as she was booked to perform at the Men’s Cave event, held at The Farm Guest Lodge on Saturday, 4 June. Dee said what made her angry was that Zodwa Wabantu, whose real name is Zodwa Libram, had asked for a deposit of R10 000 for the R20 000 gig. But she didn’t show up. “I only want her to acknowledge that she made a mistake or forgot, and send an apology. She must also refund me,” said Dee. She said that all she wanted was her money. “I also need that R10 000. I just need what is mine so we can work together in the future. I love her and I don’t see bad blood between us,” Dee said.

It’s just that I was held back by amadlozi to not go as they needed my attention during that day,” she said. She further sent a sincere apology to the event organiser and her fans for not showing up. “I have to pay back the money as it belongs to them. This was not me wanting to not go, but my ancestors who said I should remain at home. To my loyal fans in Joburg, I am so sorry. I promise I will do better next time.”
