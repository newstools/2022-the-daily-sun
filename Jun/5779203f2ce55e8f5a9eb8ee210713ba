TWO Dale College junior pupils were killed in an accident on Tuesday, 31 May. Provincial transport department spokesman Unathi Binqose confirmed that pupils from Dale (Junior) College, which is in the Eastern Cape, who were travelling from a hockey match, were involved in an accident. He said: “The accident had occurred on the N2 just outside Ntabozuko. It is alleged that the driver lost control of the school bus they were travelling in from a school match in East London. It overturned, killing the two boys on impact and seven others sustained serious injuries. “The driver is among the injured that have been rushed to hospitals in Mdantsane and East London,” he said. MEC of Education Fundile Gade sent his heartfelt condolences to the families of two pupils. “All families of the learners have been informed of this accident and the department is currently facilitating counselling for the learners and educators including the families of all affected learners,” said Gade. In April, Dale College pupil Liyabona Teyise (18) died after a collision that caused a brain bleed during a rugby match. Another pupil, Lisakhanya Lwana (17), also a rugby player, was found dead on the R63 in Qonce also in April after he was missing. His death is suspected to be caused by a hit-and-run accident.
