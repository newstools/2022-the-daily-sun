IF THE tavern owner doesn’t know what had happened on that fateful day, why is he not joining us to mourn the lives lost on his premises. These were the questions asked by the youth of East London, who gathered at Enyobeni Tavern in Scenery Park on Wednesday, 29 June. The youth lit candles to honour 21 teenagers, who died on Sunday, 26 June. ANC Youth League regional chair Ondela Sokomani said: “The tavern owner, Siyakhangela Ndevu, was present during the tragedy and he was one of the people behind the counter selling alcohol to young people but now he is nowhere to be found. We are calling on the Eastern Cape Liquor Board to investigate how their officials issued a liquor licence to a facility with only one exit. That is not in compliance with the Eastern Cape Liquor Board Act. The municipality has announced that the place has never been approved to operate as a tavern. We are of the view that this place must be completely closed.” Sinenjongo Phuthumani (19), who attended the candlelight service, said: “I knew something would happen because while I was standing in the queue waiting for my turn to buy, lights went off and I thought it was load shedding. That is when chaos started and I struggled to breathe.” The provincial government announced that a mass funeral service will be held next Wednesday, 6 July. Thereafter, families will be assisted with the transportation of the remains to be interred at burial sites of their choice. On Wednesday, 29 June, food parcels and vouchers were to assist with the needs of the families. Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said: “The provincial government together with its partners will continue to provide psycho-social support to the bereaved families and the broader community. This will include community debriefing sessions to assist everyone to cope with the impact of Sunday’s tragic event.”
