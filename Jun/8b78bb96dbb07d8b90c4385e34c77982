PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa seems to be in cruise control for his second term as party president. At the ANC Limpopo elective conference, the province produced a leadership that has publicly endorsed him for a second term. In fact, Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha was the first out of the blocks during the January 8 celebrations in that province to say the province was behind the president. Ramaphosa, it is said, was assured of support of whomever emerged, even though the faction led by Mathabatha is dominated by those known to be aligned to the RET faction. The faction is also said to be controlled by filthy rich former provincial treasurer Danny Msiza, who was stopped in his tracks from contesting the secretary position because of the amended step-aside rule. Msiza was charged for his alleged involvement in the VBS saga. By the reception of delegates at the Limpopo conference, it was clear that they were behind Ramaphosa. This comes hot on the heels of another victory by Ramaphosa’s allies in the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape. There are five provinces to go and Ramaphosa can’t count the chickens that have not yet hatched. It’s also not clear who he’s up against. While things are looking rosy for the president in terms of party politics, the same can’t be said on the legal front. This after damning revelations of robbery cover-up on his Phala Phala farm in Limpopo. When Ramaphosa addressed the closing of the Limpopo ANC conference on Sunday, 5 June he invited more questions. He chose to tell the nation that he had not stolen any taxpayer’s money when people wanted to know why he had so much money in foreign currency in his residence and not in a bank. He told the nation that because the matter was a subject of investigations by law authorities, he couldn’t give details. The nation is waiting to see whether Ramaphosa will be charged by the NPA.
