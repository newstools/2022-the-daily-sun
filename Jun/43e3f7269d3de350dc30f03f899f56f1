WHILE South Africa is waiting for the extradition of self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary, they seem to be living their best lives in their home country, Malawi. Bushiri announced that he was building an expensive hotel complex in the eastern city of Mangochi on the shores of Lake Malawi. The complex will be called Goshen City and is expected to open in October. According to the construction plans, it will comprise a hotel, lodge, school, clinic, apartments, chapel, church, business park and a sport arena. In a Facebook post, Bushiri shared that he was delighted the minister of local government Professor Blessings Chinsinga and his deputy, Halima Daud, visited Goshen City to appreciate the ongoing building project. He said the Malawian government has pledged its support. Meanwhile, the couple was in court on Friday, 17 June for a hearing on an application by the state for witnesses to record their evidence in South Africa, citing logistical challenges as the reason as well as Covid-19 restrictions. Bushiri’s lawyer objected to this. Chief Resident Magistrate, Madalitso Chimwaza, gave both parties seven days to file their final submissions. The case was postponed to 11 July.
