“DON’T cheat with a woman I don’t know. Rather get a magosha!” This is the opinion of some partners who don’t want their significant others to mess around with people they don’t know. To prevent their partners from doing that, they prefer that they get a magosha instead, as they believe the chances of their partners falling in love are slim. A magosha from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni said many women who did this were those who were struggling to satisfy their partners. The magosha, who works on the old Heidelberg Road near Vosloorus, said they were used to men coming alone but now couples came for their services. One magosha said they were hired depending on the needs of the couple. “Mostly couples agree if one partner is struggling to satisfy the other and doesn’t want them to cheat or start developing feelings for another person, then they come to us,” she said. She said they usually drove to a guest house and the man was allowed to sleep with the magosha while the woman waited in the car. “But I hear that in some cases, women prefer to be present. I guess in that case, the woman would be struggling to get aroused,” she said. “There are women who don’t have sexual feelings anymore.” To confirm this, Daily Sun spoke to a person who said they would not mind buying sex from a magosha for their partner. “I am diabetic and I wouldn’t mind if my partner sleeps with a magosha, provided they use protection,” they person said. A man (52) said he loved sex and he had an agreement with his lover that he could get service from a magosha. “I go with my partner when I go to buy magoshas,” he said. “She understands that I love sex. We even go inside the guest house together and she will wait for me while I’m busy with the magosha.” He said it was better to get the services of a magosha than dating nyatsis. “Nyatsis create problems in the family,” he said. .
