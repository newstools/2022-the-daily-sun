VIDEO footage of thugs stealing money from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala Farm in Bela-Bela, Limpopo, has surfaced. The video was played during an Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) media conference on Tuesday, 7 June. The footage shows two thugs roaming around the house on the day the money was stolen from under a bed mattress and couches. EFF leader Julius Malema threatened a national shutdown if Ramaphosa does not step aside while investigations continue. The former correctional services commissioner, Arthur Fraser, has since opened a criminal case against Ramaphosa for kidnapping, defeating ends of justice and bribery.

It is not clear how the EFF managed to obtain the footage, but social media has been abuzz since the video dropped.
