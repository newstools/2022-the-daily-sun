HUNDREDS of mourners turned out to bury little Bontle Mashiyane, the six-year-old girl who was raped and mutilated in Mganduzweni, Mpumalanga. Bontle was reported missing on 30 April, after last being seen playing outside her home. Then her dismembered body was found three weeks later, dumped not far from home. She was believed to have been killed for purposes of muthi. Family, friends and the community gathered at Faith Assembly Church of God on Friday, 10 June, to bid her farewell. Moris Mazibane told mourners that Bontle’s death had disturbed their family. He said while they were still trying to deal with the death of Hillary Gardee, who was a great-grandchild in the family, Bontle also went missing.  “We were disturbed by the news of her death and manner in which she was found. We asked ourselves so many questions without getting answers, and instead gave everything to God,” he said. Bontle’s mum, Permission Seepane, penned a touching tribute to her daughter – read by family member Jabu Shabangu.  “My dear daughter, you were beautiful, just like your name. You must always know that I love you. Continue to fight and reveal all those involved in your brutal murder.  I was hoping for the best in you. I still don’t believe that you were taken away from me. May God give you the strength to continue fighting for yourself. I will always love you,” read the letter. Attending the funeral, Culture, Sport and Recreation MEC Thandi Shongwe urged the police to make a breakthrough on the syndicate that was trading body parts. “It looks like there’s a syndicate. If you kill and take parts, what do you do with them? It means you sell them somewhere. Police must make a breakthrough on that link. We expect the justice system to be fair, and we want a harsher sentence,” she said.
