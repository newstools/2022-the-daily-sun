THE national government has intervened in Nelson Mandela Bay to avoid taps running dry. Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu visited the city on Friday, 3 June and Saturday, 4 June and announced that his department had taken over the city’s water services directorate. The minister and his deputy David Mahlobo met with municipal officials, businesspeople and community members to discuss ways to avoid a Day Zero situation. The minister also introduced the Amatola Water Board, which would lead the programme to avoid the water running out. Mayor Eugene Johnson said: “The municipality welcomes the intervention of the minister. “Playing the blame game is not going to help. We need all hands on deck. We know this intervention is being done in the spirit of intergovernmental relations and we will co-operate with the minister and the water board.” ALSO READ: Two killed, one injured in car crash Residents voiced their frustration with the municipality’s poor response when they reported water-related problems. Mavis Vusani said: “The municipality did install water tanks for us but people dump dead dogs inside them. We are praying to God to bring us rain because we are sick and tired of drinking water with dead animals in it.” Melumzi Kona said the municipality needed to speed up the war on leaks because a lot of water was being wasted. He said they want to hear long-term solutions. Mchunu said the intervention would focus on drought mitigation measures, reducing consumption to 50 litres per person per day and extending water supply.
