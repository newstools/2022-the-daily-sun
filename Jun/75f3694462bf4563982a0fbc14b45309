A SIGN language Interpreter has voiced out her experiences to encourage young people to learn more about the Deaf culture. She urged people not to shy away from exploring the beautiful and diverse culture. The 32-year-old, from Lefaragatlha in Phokeng outside Rustenburg, North West, said she fell in love with Sign language when she dropped out from studying Information Technology. Letlhogonolo Phetoe said she lost interest in the course, and was then introduced to Sign interpretation at the Tshirologo Disability Group in Phokeng. “It triggered my curiosity when I saw how signs were used to communicate. I did not look back, and the experience with deaf people has been amazing," she said. Letlhogonolo works at Royal Bafokeng administration as a Sign language Interpreter, and is also responsible for disability programmes in the area. “My aim is to create awareness. People should learn to take Sign language as any other. Deaf people live among us, and it’s important to know how to interact with them. It is really fulfilling for me to have broken barriers in communicating with them.” She further spoke on how young people could consider opportunities within the culture and make money from it. She said the culture was diverse and only needed one to gain knowledge about it. She empathised that as we were celebrating young people, she wanted to motivate them to take a chance and explore an opportunity to learn and consider career paths they could pursue with Sign language.
