BAFANA Bafana started their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers with a disappointing 2-1 defeat at the hands of Morocco at the Stade Prince Moulay Abdallah in Rabat on Thursday. Hugo Broos’ side, who took an early lead through young striker Lyle Foster, couldn’t hold on for what would have been a stunning victory against the North African giants. Morocco, who were buoyed by a vociferous crowd, were stunned to life and took the attack to Bafana with waves of attack which finally paid off when they got the equalizer before grabbing the winner at the death. Ronwen Williams’ heroics in the Bafana goal were not enough with the Atlas Lions getting back into the match through Sevilla striker Youssef En-Nasyri’s close range header in the second half. They continued to put Broos’ charges under immense pressure, and they couldn’t hold on with Ayoub El Kaabi ensuring the Atlas Lions grabbed all three points.
