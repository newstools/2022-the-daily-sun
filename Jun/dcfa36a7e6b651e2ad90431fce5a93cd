GENERATIONS: The Legacy actress, Letoya Makhene and her wife, Lebo Keswa, are fearing for their lives. This after they were allegedly assaulted by Letoya’s ex-bae, Tshepo Leeuw. They dated before calling things off in 2019. According to Letoya and Lebo, Tshepo allegedly assaulted them after an argument at his house on Sunday, 12 June. Lebo said they went to his house as Tshepo had done something that made them angry. “That’s when Tshepo attacked us. Three other people in his house came to attack us as well. “While kicking me, one of them shouted: ‘Hambo landa imbazo’, which Letoya later told me it meant, ‘go fetch an axe’,” said Lebo. Lebo said both she and Letoya were bruised from the beating. “I had to go to a doctor who gave me a J88 form. I’ll have to go for an operation for a cut I suffered on my mouth. I couldn’t get to the doctors on time, so that caused an issue with my lip. ALSO READ : TV presenter shares pain of being successful “Letoya threw herself on top of me to protect me. She also got bruised and also went to the doctor and a J88 was also issued to her,” said Lebo. Letoya said Tshepo is causing instability in her home. “I’m the reason why this is happening. It’s a horrible situation to be in. “ Fact of the matter is I left him, fell in love with Lebo and moved on with my life. He now wants to ruin my relationship. It’s unfair,” she said. Letoya said they are scared and she feels that the justice system has failed her. “We are getting killed at the hands of our perpetrators.If this man ever kills me, at least the cops will know where to start.” Lebo said they have applied for a protection order against Tshepo.
