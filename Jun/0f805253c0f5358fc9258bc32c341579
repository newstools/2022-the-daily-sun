A MASS funeral will be held for the 21 teenagers who died at Enyobeni Tavern. The funeral service for the victims of the disaster in Scenery Park, East London, will be held at the city hall on Wednesday, 6 July. This was confirmed by the Eastern Cape government after funeral arrangements with affected families were concluded. Meanwhile, provincial health spokeswoman Yonela Dekeda confirmed that all the victims had been identified and released to their families. Provincial government spokeswoman, Khuselwa Rantjie, said: “A mass funeral service will be held. We understand some families want to have a private service and after the mass service, they will be assisted with transport and the remains will be interred at burial sites of their choice. “Government has expressed appreciation for the support that has been received from all sectors of society in preparation for the funeral. Among those are AVBOB. The funeral parlour has pledged burial cost support for each family. The Buffalo City Municipality has waived grave fees for the burial of the deceased and, together with the provincial government, will facilitate other logistical needs to ensure a dignified send-off for the deceased. “Food parcels and vouchers have been delivered to assist the families, and the government will continue to provide psycho-social support to the bereaved families and the broader community. This will include community debriefing sessions to help everyone to cope with the impact of Sunday’s tragic event.” Eastern Cape police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana reassured the families that postmortems have been performed. Once the results are available, the families and the public will be informed.
