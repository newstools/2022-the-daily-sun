After the recent reminders about Qatar’s ban on homosexuality, any single individuals who still wish to watch their team play in person have been warned to not have sex during their stay. "Sex is very much off the menu, unless you are coming as a husband and wife team,” according to UK online publication The Sun. "There definitely will be no one-night stands at this tournament and there will be no partying at all."Everyone needs to keep their heads about them, unless they want to risk ¬being stuck in prison." There is essentially a sex ban in place at this year’s World Cup for the first time ever. "Sex outside of marriage carries a prison sentence of up to seven years in the Middle Eastern country." Traveling supporters also need to be aware that - although alcohol is not illegal in Qatar, there is zero tolerance for drinking in public and being drunk in public is a crime. And they need to know they face the death penalty if they are caught smuggling drugs such as cocaine to the host nation.Fifa are determined to keep high-profile games free of incident after some of this year's biggest matches were marred by off-field antics.
