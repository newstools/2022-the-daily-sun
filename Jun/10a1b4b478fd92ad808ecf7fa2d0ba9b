VUSI “Khekhe” Mathibela has been found guilty of killing North West businessman Wandile Bozwana. Judge Papi Mosopa delivered the judgment against Mathibela, known as Mamelodi’s number-one tsotsi, and his co-accused in the North Gauteng High Court, Tshwane, on Thursday, 23 June. Bozwana and his business partner Mpho Baloyi were shot at on the Garsfontein off-ramp on the N1 highway in Tshwane in October 2015. Bozwana died soon after arriving at the hospital while Baloyi survived. Mathibela, Matamela Mutapa, Bonginkosi Khumalo and Sipho Hudla were found guilty of murder and attempted murder. Evidence presented in court, including confessions, phone records and footage from surveillance cameras, linked all four to the murder. On Wednesday, the judge went through the evidence and testimony given during the trial. He read out evidence showing how Bozwana and Baloyi were followed from Sandton Square in Joburg to a salon and McDonald’s restaurant before heading back to Tshwane on the N1, where the shooting happened. The court also heard that the suspects were paid R60 000 to share, and that Mathibela was the one who had organised the hit. The sentencing proceedings will be held on 4 August.
