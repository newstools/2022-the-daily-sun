ANGRY residents said they were sick and tired of gogo Elisa Setla (91) being turned into a beggar because her daughter had taken her Sassa card. They said to eat and get warm water, gogo Elisa had to ask for help from her neighbours while her daughter Nozibele Nxumalo was allegedly eating cooked food at her mum’s expense. On Saturday, residents of Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni confronted the daughter and demanded that she give back the gogo’s Sassa card. She allegedly tried to refuse but residents had already called the cops. Residents said Nozibele took the card out from her handbag and handed it over to the residents. “The card has been taken and is with one of the gogo’s relatives,” said neighbour Dorah Mashifane. Residents claimed the daughter, who works as a security guard, has been taking gogo’s money for three years. They said she lied about wanting to open a funeral policy for gogo and she took it from one of the relatives using that excuse. Nozibele’s younger brother Nqobile said he did not like how his sister was treating their mother. “I decided to report to the community because my sister is a very aggressive person,” he claimed. Gogo Elisa said all she wanted was to see things well taken care of and to get food and electricity. Daughter Nozibele said she was doing her best to look after gogo but her jealous brother wanted gogo Elisa’s card and that was why he was involving neighbours. But Nqobile said he didn’t even want the card. “All I want is for a responsible person to be appointed. We have aunts who can do that. She’s not telling the truth. Gogo asking for food from neighbours isn’t right.” Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said social workers would be deployed to the family to investigate.
