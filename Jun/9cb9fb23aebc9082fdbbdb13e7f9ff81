THE Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is threatening to “shut down” President Cyril Ramaphosa while investigations against him are underway. Speaking at a press conference, EFF lader Julius Malema said: “If Ramaphosa refuses to step aside to allow open and transparent investigation to take place, the EFF will mobilise sectors of society to stop recognising him as the president and will not permit him to undertake any presidential function. “We have the capacity to do so, and will, in defence of the rule of law.” This after former spy boss Arthur Fraser opened a criminal case against him last week. EFF and other parties called for him to step down for failing to report a crime that took place at his farm, where $4 million (about R61 million) was allegedly stolen. The conference began with the party playing footage from the day the money was stolen from under the bed mattress and couches. Malema lashed at those questioning Fraser’s credibility. “He is a career spy. You must know his story is verified and confirmed. He’s reliable.” Malema said the EFF had submitted to Parliament questions to Ramaphosa to hold him accountable. These included how much was stored, the currency or whether the revenue collector was alerted. He was also sceptical about the Guptas’ arrest. “Before I answer regarding the Guptas, give me a photo of them in prison. There is a possibility that this story might be used as a diversion,” he said.
