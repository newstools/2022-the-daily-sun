A SKUKUZA Golf Course worker is in hospital after being attacked by a leopard in the Kruger National Park on Sunday, 26 June. Park spokesman Ike Phaahla said: “We can confirm the incident which took place at the staff living quarters on Sunday. “He was taken to hospital after being stabilised by the local doctor and is reportedly recuperating very well. “The incident takes place when plans are at an advanced stage to install a more durable fence that will make the place safer,” he said. “His injuries are serious, but not life threatening. He is in a stable condition. The leopard fled the scene.” Phaahla said the man was outside his room when he was attacked. “There were people who witnessed the attack and called for an ambulance after chasing the animal away,” said Phaahla. He said officials were still looking for the leopard. “We don’t have the details of the victim, as he’s employed by a private concession in the golf course,” he said. Skukuza Golf Club is a nine-hole or 18-tee course situated in Kruger National Park on the outskirts of Skukuza Rest Camp. Since the course isn’t fenced-in, lions, leopards, hippos, elephants, impala, warthog and baboons are a common sight.
