MARK Alexander (29) from England was recently jailed for stabbing his girlfriend more than 60 times. It is reported that the incident happened on 27 December 2020, after a neighbour heard a woman screaming at a residential property. Metropolitan Police Detective Sergeant Jason Crinnion said cops were called at about 9pm, where they found that a 26-year-old woman had already succumbed to stab wounds. He said a post-mortem examination revealed that the woman had been stabbed 63 times and also suffered a number of cut injuries. READ: Man jailed for killing his girlfriend! Alexander was arrested at the scene and questioned about his involvement. He told cops that the woman was stabbed by another man, whom he believed she was having an affair with, and denied being with her when the attack happened. “The pair were also caught on CCTV together at a nearby shop around 30 minutes before the attack. The evidence officers collected proved that Alexander lied about another man being involved, and he was the person responsible for the attack. He was charged and remanded in custody,” Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Crinnion said police found two knives that were covered in blood on the property, and Alexander’s DNA was found on both weapons. Following a series of court appearances, Alexander was sentenced to 15 years in jail at the Old Bailey on Friday, 27 May. “This was a vicious act of violence on a defenceless woman who had the rest of her life ahead of her. My thoughts remain with her family and friends as they continue to come to terms with her death,” Crinnion added.
