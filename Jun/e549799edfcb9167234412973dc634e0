A SANGOMA has been accused of raping young kids. The sangoma from Cloverdene, near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, allegedly lured the kids to his house before giving them muthi and sleeping with them, or touching their private parts. Angry parents hunted him down and gave him a few lashes on Friday, 10 June, but he was saved by the police and a rape case was opened. The parents said their kids returned from the sangoma’s house with coloured strings on their wrists and necks. The sangoma allegedly told the kids the strings would protect them against evil. The two girls and a boy told their parents the sangoma used to fetch them from school. The parents took their children to the clinic, where the boy was confirmed to have been raped. The parents said they were not happy with the treatment they received at Crystal Park Police Station “The station commander was rude to us and didn’t act like a mother when we told her what had happened,” said a parent. A neighbour said he used to see kids go in and out of the sangoma’s house. Sergeant Lerato Mopeli said a rape case was opened and transferred to the Benoni sexual offences unit.
