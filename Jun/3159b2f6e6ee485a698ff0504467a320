RESIDENTS of Rolle outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge Mpumalanga were shocked when they discovered the body of rising soccer star Nhlamulo “Spikiri” Mathebula in Rolle Custom sports ground, Rolle Village on Saturday, 11 June at about 8pm. The 22-year-old had multiple gunshot wounds in his upper body. Shocked neighbours said they heard gunshots from the sport ground direction on Saturday. “We heard several gunshots and a person screaming for a help. But we couldn’t see what was happening as it was dark,” said a resident. Spikiri’s saddened gogo Betty Mathumbu (62) said they received a call from the police that her grandson has been shot dead. “We were at a funeral of his aunt’s daughter in the village when received a call from police saying Nhlamulo has been gunned down. His parents are badly affected. He came from Gauteng to attend the funeral on Wednesday. But he is now murdered. It’s hurting as our children and us are no longer safe from the criminals on the loose going around killing us” she said. His saddened coach and also his uncle, Freedom Mthethwa, said: “We had just come home on Wednesday morning from playing Lerato Lamola Winter Soccer Tournament in Tembisa. We are really shattered. All players are badly affected after receiving the news of his brutal killings right at his team sport ground. He was a left wing. We have lost one of the good players and son. Our main concern is that we remove the youths from street to keep them busy with soccer. But it is hurting as they are being targeted and killed by the very same people in the street. We hope the police will leave no stone unturned until they find his killers.
