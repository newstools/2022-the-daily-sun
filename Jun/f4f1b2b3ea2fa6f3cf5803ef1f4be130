THE ANC in Gauteng has thrown a lot of ring steel around The Lake Hotel where it is holding its 14th elective conference that kicked off on Thursday, 23 June 2020. You would be mistaken thinking you are stepping into a national key point as you have to go through a thorough security check that involves the bomb squad and the K9 points. A heavy security presence has been deployed around the premises with police patrolling the area forcing friends of delegates restricted on the periphery.

"The second issue is that in many conferences disruptions are done by friends of delegates, people who are not supposed to come to the conference, people who come drunk armed."There is a high police presence at the venue and everything that one getting into the venue is thoroughly searched. Cars are also searched, with sniffer dogs checking for any potential threats. Every entrance has metal detecting scanners. However, the chairs inside the whole area are not bolted to the floor, but they won't be thrown around as the outgoing Chairperson David Makhura said this will be a conference of ideas and not chairs like it once was in the Eastern Cape years back.
