DURING cross-examination, Sergeant Thabo Mosia conceded that the bullet projectile found on the kitchen unit could have been planted there. It was revealed by Advocate Zandile Mshololo, representing accused number five, that a witness had made a statement that the scene was contaminated before Mosia could collect evidence. This was said during the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial as it resumed in Tshwane on Tuesday, 7 June. Mshololo continued her cross-examination of state witness Mosia at the Northern Gauteng High Court. Mosia is the first of more than 100 witnesses expected to give testimony. ALSO READ: Why Musk threatens to cancel Twitter deal! As cross-examination continued, it was also revealed that the first time he arrived on the scene in the early hours of 27 October 2014, he didn’t find the projectile until the following day. Speaking on the blood swap taken, Mosia said when Meyiwa was shot in the kitchen, there was an alleged sign of a scuffle. Mshololo asked why there was no blood on the floor where he was shot, but only in the living room. And he responded that it was also surprising to him, so he could not answer. She asked whether the absence of blood could have been that, according to a witness statement read earlier, the floor had been cleaned. “I cannot answer that,” he said. Mshololo further accused Mosia of tampering with evidence after revealing that he did not book it at the proper place soon after he collected it, but instead placed it in his locker. Mosia said he did not temper with any evidence, and the only reason he didn’t book it on the same day was because he was tired. “You are running away from the truth, which is why you cannot answer,” asserted Mshololo. And Mosia replied: “I believe what I have testified is nothing but the truth.”
