A DELFT teenager is lucky to be alive after he was allegedly disarmed and shot with his firearm on Wednesday, 23 June at about 11.30am. The 18-year-old man who is said to be from the other side of Delft called Blikkiesdorp was walking on Aberdale Street in Leiden when he was stopped by three men. “They opened and checked his chest, after that they found a firearm on him and shot him with that firearm,” said a witness, who has a vegetable stall on the street where the incident occurred. She said the shooters acted like they were just walking on the street before pouncing on the man. “It’s alleged that the teenager had come this side to shoot someone, but the would-be victim saw him first and sent some people to deal with him. It is gang war that is going on here on the streets,” said another resident who was at the crime scene. The shooters fled the scene and left the man fighting for his life on the road. He was assisted by cops and paramedics who arrived on the scene a few minutes after he was shot. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed the incident. “Delft police attended to a complaint in Aberdale Street in Leiden at about 11.45am. Upon arrival at the crime scene, they found an 18-year-old man who sustained gunshot wounds to his body. The victim was transported to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. “The unknown suspect/s, who fled the scene, are yet to be arrested,” said Swartbooi. Cops believe motive for the attack might be gang-related. Swartbooi said cops were investigating a case of attempted murder.
