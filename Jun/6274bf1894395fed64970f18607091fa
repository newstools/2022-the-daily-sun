DEFENCE lawyer Advocate Malesela Teffo continued with his submissions in the North Gauteng High Court on Tuesday, 14 June. Teffo is representing accused number one to four in the Senzo Meyiwa murder case. He addressed the court by saying it’s true that he received the second case docket from Lieutenant-Colonel Buthelezi in state prosecutor, Advocate George Baloyi’s, office. He added that Warrant Officer Makhubo opened case 375, which is the second docket. He said among the offences alleged is defeating the ends of justice, accessory after the fact and conspiracy to commit murder. Teffo added that the first case docket, which was opened in October 2014 when Senzo was killed, was opened by Constable T Mathebula at Botshelong Hospital in Vosloorus, where Senzo was pronounced dead. Mathebula was called by the hospital. “The officers were told that Senzo Meyiwa was taken to the hospital in his vehicle, which was driven by Nonhlanhla Kelly Khumalo,” he said. Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela interjected to ask if Teffo was giving evidence and Teffo said he is laying the basis for his objection to the two NPA letters. The letters in question were read in court on Monday, 13 June with the NPA distancing its self from the second docket, which it said was without merit as it was compiled by junior staff. Addressing the court, Teffo said Makhubo is the complainant in the second case docket as he opened the file. He added that Makhubo and Buthelezi, the two investigators in the second docket, will be his defence witnesses. He said the first case docket now has different investigating officers, led by Brigadier Gininda and that Gininda has deposed two affidavits on the findings of his investigation. Teffo told the court that he requested Buthelezi and Makhubo to disclose the second docket to him in Baloyi’s office on 23 March. He said before he started representing his clients in March, all four accused were represented by Legal Aid.
