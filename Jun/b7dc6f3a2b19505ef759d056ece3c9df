THE South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has reportedly paid 750 000 beneficiaries of the Covid-19 SRD grant. In a statement on Friday, 17 June, Sassa said it was planning to increase the number of payments to over a million by the end of the week. The agency said these payments made were specifically for the reconsideration appeals for the period from August to November 2021. “We appeal to clients to provide Sassa with their bank account details to enable us to pay them into their accounts. Notifications to update details have also been sent to clients whose reconsideration appeal has been approved, but their bank account details were outstanding,” the statement read. The agency further said it had cleared the first four months of backlog caused by an extensive procurement and systems development process. “Due to the challenges with setting up this system, we had a backlog not only with the reconsideration appeals but also with assessments for new applications from April 2022. Clients are advised not to go to the Post Office to access funds,” Sassa added.
