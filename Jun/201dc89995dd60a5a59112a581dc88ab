THE long arm of the law caught up with nine accused for the
municipal tender fraud allegedly committed back in 2015. Hawks spokeswoman Warrant Officer Bonnie Nxumalo said the
Hawks' National Clean Audit Task Team executed warrants of arrest against nine
accused for fraud, forgery and contravention of the Municipal Finance
Management Act. In a statement, Nxumalo said, “It is alleged that in 2015,
the Dihlabeng Local Municipality in Free State advertised a tender for security services at
their buildings. A three-year tender worth R40 million was allegedly awarded in
2016 to a certain company without following proper procedures. “Other bidding rivalry filed a complaint with the high court
in Free State but the issuing of the tender was not halted. The matter prompted
the Hawks' investigation and it was later discovered that there are documents
which were also altered in favour of the company.” READ: Two workers bust for R10M fraud! The accused, Mfihlwa Mdakane (37), Tsiliso Eric Maitse (49),
