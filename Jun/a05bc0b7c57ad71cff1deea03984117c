  According to our informant who is close to the Tembo, the former SuperSport United will be working closely with MacDonald Makhubedu and Thabo Senong as his assistants. Owen Da Gama was sacked by Sekhukhune last week, which paved way for Tembo who has been on the job market after parting ways with SuperSport. Our informant said Tembo is eager and excited to be joining Sekhukhune, PSL's fastest growing club. "He believes the club has the potential to win trophies, and with his experience, he believes he might contribute immensely. I understand he will be head coach and Makhubedu and Senong assisting him, but that is something that will have to be confirmed by the club. But he will be part of the big rle players at the club, before the new season starts. He is needed for pre-season planning," said our mole close to Tembo. Sekhukhune last week made a massive clear out of players they don't need to pave way for new ones for the 2022-23 season.
