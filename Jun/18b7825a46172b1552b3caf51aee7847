GOGO Jeanette Dikgale (82) wants to spend the rest of her life in a clean home without the smell of kak in her living room. Gogo Jeanette from Majazana in the Vaal told Daily Sun she can’t even eat properly anymore because of this situation. She said she has had this problem since 2018 and it keeps getting worse. All she does is clean up kak because when the sewerage pipe bursts it floods straight into her home. Gogo sometimes gets stuck inside her home and neighbours have to give her food through the window. But sometimes she’d be too disgusted to eat. “I have a chronic illness. How do I take my medication without eating?” Gogo said all her kids have died and her grandchildren won’t come to live with her. “I understand they don’t want to live in a home that’s flooded with kak every two weeks,” said Jeanette. She said she last saw her grandkids at her husband’s funeral in 2019. At the moment gogo lives with her neighbour. Cecilia Xaba (58) said she’s been trying to get help for gogo but she doesn’t know which doors to knock on anymore. She said when people from City of Joburg come they unblock the sewage and leave. “I guess they don’t care because this doesn’t affect them,” she said. City of Joburg spokesman Virgil James told Daily Sun the city wasn’t aware of the matter but they have now sent officials to asses and to help.
