GAUTENG crime statistics from the previous quarter have painted a grim picture. The murder rate in the province has shot up by over 45% with over 1 400 people killed from January to March. The crime statistics were delivered by the Gauteng police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, on Tuesday, 14 June. Mawela said: “We have recorded a 45,2% increase in murders, which amounts to 1 403 people killed during this period. This is 437 more people murdered as compared to the same period in 2020/2021.” He said the analysis of murder cases has shown again that the majority of causative factors are arguments, misunderstandings (not domestic related), road rage and provocation. “During this period, we lost five police officers. One was killed while on duty and four were murdered while off duty.” Mawela also said that sexual offences had increased by 11,3%. He said the overall number of sexual offences is 2 921, while rape accounts for 2 267 out of this number. He said assault with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, common assault and robbery contributed 33% of the overall crime in Gauteng. “Social ills within our communities are the main root causes of assault incidents. “Should the community adopt better acceptable means of conflict management and reduce substance abuse, surely some categories of crime such as domestic violence, gender-based violence, murder and attempted murder will be reduced,” said Mawela. Kidnappings have also been a burning issue in Mzansi and Mawela said they continued to rise in the province. “During the three months under review, we have seen an increase with 1 563 cases reported as compared to the same period in 2020/2021 where there were only 524 cases reported.” Mawela said they would continue to intensify O Kae Molao operations.
