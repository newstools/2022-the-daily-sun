THE cars bought with money stolen from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s farm were reportedly seized by the Namibian authorities. Six cars, including a VW Golf GTI and a Ford Ranger mentioned in former spy boss Arthur Fraser’s affidavit, were taken from the suspects in 2020. On Tuesday 7 June, Namibian publication The Namibian reported: “In 2020, Namibian authorities had already confiscated two VW Golfs, a VW bus, a Ford Ranger pickup, a Toyota Hilux and a Toyota Land Cruiser pickup from some of the suspects. “They were also monitoring a guest house at Outapi said to have been bought with the proceeds of the stolen money and froze a number of bank accounts. “Namibian security sources said the South African government was denying the incident, allegedly because Ramaphosa may find it difficult to explain the cash in his house and the security breach.” Namibian President Hage Geingob has denied allegedly helping Ramaphosa to illegally extradite the suspect who fled to Namibia. “People were here, somebody came here illegally and was arrested. Later on, he was charged and he paid and went back to South Africa. So I do not know what favour I would have done anybody. “This thing happened in South Africa and there will be a court case, maybe. Let’s see what they are going to say I have done. It is a criminal case,” Giengob was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Meanwhile, several South African parties have written to Speaker of Parliament Nosiviwe Mapisa Nqakula demanding answers. On Tuesday 7 May, EFF leader Julius Malema threatened a possible shutdown if Ramaphosa refused to step down. The EFF in Namibia is expected to hold a media briefing on Thursday 9 June.
