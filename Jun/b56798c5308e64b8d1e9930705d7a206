ZODWA Wabantu’s fans might have to say goodbye to her for a while. The entertainer from Soweto told Daily Sun she was waiting for confirmation from her ancestors as to whether she should continue performing or become a healer. The 36-year-old, whose real name is Zodwa Libram, spoke up after several people complained about her not pitching up for gigs. Zodwa has recently been sharing her journey into spirituality through her Instagram account. She said she had to miss some events because her ancestors demanded her attention from time to time.

They always show me the good and the bad of this world, and I sometimes miss off-ramps on my way to venues as they will be protecting me from something,” she said. Zodwa said when she told event organisers about this, some of them didn’t believe her. She said her ancestors had taken over and she was now a different person. “I’ve been missing events and people have been paying me for bookings, so now I have to refund them. I don’t want to be that person.” Zodwa said if her ancestors wanted her off the stage, she would listen. She said they had been giving her many signs.
