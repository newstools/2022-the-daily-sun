PAYMENTS for the new cycle of the special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress R350 grant will begin in mid-June. According to the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa), they will continue clearing outstanding payments from the previous cycle as soon as the bank details are confirmed. “The payments will not be done together but will be done month by month. More than one payment may be made in a month, but no one will receive double payments in amount,” Sassa said. The agency stated that it will make these multiple payments per month until the backlog is cleared, at which point monthly payments will resume. ALSO READ | Truck
