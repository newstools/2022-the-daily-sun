VILLAGERS can finally look forward to a bridge being built over the dangerous Mutlumuvi River. Mpumalanga public works, roads and transport MEC Mohita Latchminarain confirmed the construction near Kumani in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, a week ago. “The total construction of the new bridge will cost over R126 million.” The design, carried out in 2016/17, includes the upgrade of a 5km gravel road connecting Kumani to Thulamahashe town. “The project was handed over to the contractor on 20 April.” A happy villager said: “This project has brought job opportunities, especially to the unemployed youth. It’s unfortunate that our fellow villagers are not around to enjoy the fruits of our service delivery protests. Many are serving jail sentences.” Avoid Mkhatshwa (23), Prince Ndlovu (25) and Morlinah Mhlanga (25) were sentenced to five years each by the Mhala Regional Court in April for inciting public violence. Last April, villagers shut down Thulamahashe Plaza, a mall and schools by barricading roads to demand a bridge. They said the river was preventing them from going to work or kids to school in the rainy season.
