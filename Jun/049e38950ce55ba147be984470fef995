FOUR suspects, who were arrested in connection with the murder of Kutlwano Kasibe, appeared before the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto on Friday, 24 June. The suspects were arrested on Wednesday, 22 June, after Kutlwano (16) was allegedly tied to a tree and doused with ice water a week ago. The mentally challenged teen was then sjamboked and shocked with a car battery. This after residents alleged he stole a tap. He was then dragged and dumped on the side of the road, where his mum found him. Following the gruesome incident, Daily Sun saw messages and voice notes shared in a WhatsApp group belonging to residents. Some said they only wanted to discipline the teen while others said he was disciplined like any other drug-addict and thief. However, Kutlwano’s mum Dorah Kasibe denied that he was a criminal. She said her son was murdered like a dog, and she wanted justice to be served. The matter was postponed to 7 July for bail application.
