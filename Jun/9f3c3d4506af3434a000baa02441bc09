THE organisation, Vuka Enough, sought God’s intervention to address issues facing young people. The organisation and the community held a prayer session against drugs, suicide and mental illness on Saturday, 18 June. The organisation is based in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane Vicky Lamola, who heads it, said: “We feel like the youth is fading away and as a result, we won’t have young people who will lead this country in years to come.” One of the young attendees, Tshegofatso Mabunda, said: “I saw a need to attend because we can’t do this by ourselves. We need God’s intervention for our lives to change.” Pastor Successor Sekete told the attendees that seeking answers from God is always the best step. “It is important for parents to teach their children about morals so that we can build a better society,” she said.
