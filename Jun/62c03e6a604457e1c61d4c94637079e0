THE City of Mbombela seems to not understand the informal economy of Mzansi. Hawkers trading on the streets of KaBokweni in Mpumalanga are worried about their businesses after the City of Mbombela served them with notices. In a letter dated 13 May, seen by Daily Sun, the municipality notifies hawkers to demolish their structures within seven days. Zodwa Lukhele (62), who has been trading in the area for more than 30 years, said she approached the municipality in 1996 but was told there was no land available. “I don’t know where the municipality is expecting me to go. I have spent my whole life here. I have raised my children and I am raising my grandchildren with the money I make here,” she said. Zodwa, who has employed three people, said they were told that they made the township dirty. Another hawker, Jeaneth Mawelela (55), said the money she made helped her for her sons varsity fees. Sophie Mvalo (59) said she didn’t plan to move unless the municipality provided her with another place. City of Mbombela spokesman Joseph Ngala said the hawkers ignored previous warnings. “We’re going to use the legal route for the ones with illegal structures. We will assist the others to settle properly in demarcated areas,” he said.
