A 51-YEAR-OLD man was arrested for possession of suspected stolen items. Following an intelligence-led operation conducted on Wednesday, 22 June, cops discovered exhaust systems, catalytic converters, brand new tyres, steering wheel covers and various medication for diabetes. According to spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart, information led Uitenhage cops to the premises in Dobson Street, Kariega, with a search warrant. “Upon searching the premises, 74 complete cold-end exhaust systems, 300 catalytic converters, 24 new tyres, 60 steering wheel covers and various diabetic medication worth more than R1,2 million were confiscated.  “A 51-year-old suspect was arrested on a charge of possession of suspected stolen property,” Swart said. The suspect is due to appear in the Kariega Magistrates Court on Friday, 24 June.  Investigations revealed that the catalytic converters were taken during a hijacking in Kwadwesi earlier this month. Swart said more arrests are expected as the investigation unfolds.
