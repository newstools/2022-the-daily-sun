TRADERS from Cape Town are happy now that the municipality has extended the grace period for the payment of their permits. Traders were originally granted an extension of payment from 1 January to 30 June this year. The City of Cape Town has now extended the period from 1 July until the end of December. MMC for Economic Growth James Vos said though the informal traders have managed to recover in the past six months, the city realised that many are still struggling. “The extension is in response to the continued unprecedented negative impact of the pandemic,” Vos said. Informal traders pay between R80 to R1 500 per month. Nomaliso Mjuza (35), who sells fruit and veggies at her stand at Cape Town taxi rank, said the relief will go a long way to cushion the traders. “I pay R300 per month which is the profit I get in two days. Not paying trading permits for a year means I have saved R3 600 which is a huge amount for me,” said Nomaliso. Vos said informal traders contribute a lot to the economy and it is important to stand with them in difficult times. “Many traders are still struggling to survive financially and put their businesses back on a sustainable footing,” said Vos. “This extension will go some way to providing a much-needed reprieve.” Trader John Mukunga (56), who sells clothes on the Grand Parade, said he has been putting aside money to pay for the permits on 1 July. “I pay R450 and have put away money to pay the permits. Now I have heard that we are not paying for the rest of the year. “It is a big relief for me. I will use the money to pay for my grandson’s school transport,” he said.
