WHEN his relatives received a chilling message on their cellphones saying Boy Makhubo had been killed because he owed R30 000, they were horrified. The 35-year-old’s family rushed to look for his body as the messages said it had been dumped in a river. However, members of the family could not find anything and went to the police. On Tuesday, 31 May, their worst fears were confirmed when cops found his body at the Spaarwater Dam in Duduza, Ekurhuleni. Boy’s aunt said: “We don’t know who these people are and how they got our numbers.” The aunt said Boy disappeared from his shack in Maryvale squatter camp on Sunday, 29 May.

Members of the family said Boy was not the type of person who disappeared without saying where he was going. “Boy resigned from his job and there was a lump sum he received. His friends were all over him after he got the money,” she said. “The people who killed him were just after his money and they made up a story claiming he owed them.” Members of the family said it looked like the people who killed Boy also emptied his shack. “When we got there, all his things had been taken. However, they later brought some of his belongings back,” she said. “They brought the wardrobe, three sofas, a headboard and other items. We heard his set of kitchen units is also somewhere in the neighbourhood. We think they are bringing them back out of guilt.” Police spokesman Sergeant Harry Manaka said a murder case was opened and cops were investigating.
