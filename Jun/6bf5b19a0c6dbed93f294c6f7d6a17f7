BMW M GmbH is adding a new body variant to its line-up of
high-performance models in the premium midsize class. The first-ever BMW M3 Touring combines authentic motor sport
feeling with a very distinct character and a broader spread of practical
qualities.  Its powertrain technology is focused wholly on delivering
beguiling performance and brings together the 375 kW/510 hp version of the
six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology, the eight-speed
M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic and the M xDrive all-wheel-drive
system.
