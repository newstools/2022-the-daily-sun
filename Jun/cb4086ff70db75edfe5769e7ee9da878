SAMKELO Ndlovu has been accused of making a fraudulent payment to a Bolt driver. Driver Nkosi Sithole accused the Rhythm City actress of scamming him of R109 on 10 June. “I transported Samkelo, her child and another person from a complex in Sandton to Papachinos, next to Montecasino in Joburg. “When we arrived, she was about to get out without paying when I told her it was a cash trip. “She apologised, saying she thought it was a card payment trip,” he said.

The SunTeam contacted Samkelo, who said she paid for the trip over the app. However, she refused to send proof of payment. “I paid the whole amount via the app. I don’t owe this guy anything. So, you’re going to run with the story? That’s fine but I won’t send you the proof of payment,” she said.
