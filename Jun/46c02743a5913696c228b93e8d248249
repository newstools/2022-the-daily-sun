Ratshibvumo Mulovhedzi, Justice Chabalala's agent, has confirmed that they are already working on a plan to get a new club for  player who just parted ways with Orlando Pirates on Thursday. In a period where Pirates are clearing their dressing room, Chabalala was not spared the wrath of the axe that has befallen many players comprising Kwanda Mngonyama, Abel Mabaso, Elson Sithole and Thabang Monare in Orlando. While Pirates announced new coach on Saturday in Jose Riveiro, then Chabalala will not be among players to impress him from outside. Mulovhedzi said they're waiting for Chabalala's clearance from Pirates before they start going out on a full o market search for a new job. Mulovhedzi of Rush Hour Sports Management, said the former Free State Stars defender who was on loan at Sekhukhune United, had hoped to get more game time in order to be reconsidered at Pirates, but it wasnt to be. The Rush Hour Sports management boss said: "It is true Chabalala parted ways with Pirates after long discussions with the Pirates management. I would like to thank Pirates chairman Dr Irvin Khoza for understanding and giving us an opportunity. "Now the 30-year-old is in search for work where he will stay permanently. There are other clubs that are interested in Chabalala." The Giyani-born defender lack game-time at Sekhukhune United where he made only four appearances in the first round of the season.
