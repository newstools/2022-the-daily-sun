THERE are non-educational activities going on behind Drommedaris Primary School in Reiger Park, Boksburg. Zama zamas are mining behind the classrooms, while nyaope thugs lurk to see what to steal from the school. Thugs have even opened a hole to gain access to the school. They are stripping the school toilets bit by bit. On top of that, eight classrooms were burnt down on Sunday, 5 June and the school suspects it could be the same nyaope thugs. They now fear they will come for the metal from the burnt desks. Ward Councillor Edith Klaasen said they have school patrollers, but they are still not safe as one was stabbed by thugs some time ago. She said teachers are often robbed. Klaasen said a stretch of land behind the school is owned by a gold mining company and the land is a headache for the school as thugs hide there. “There was a mine dump before and they removed it, but there’s some residue which is now mined by illegal miners. We appeal to the mine to clean up this area to stop thugs from hiding. We really want the mining company to come to the party.” School Governing Body member Esmeralda Olifant and Klaasen appealed for donations and sponsors to help fix the school toilets, fence and for the maintenance of the school. “The subsidy from the department is meant for certain things and not others. This is a very old school,” said Klaasen. A case of arson was opened at Reiger Park Police Station and cops are investigating. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the affected pupils, who are in the foundation phase, are at home until alternative measures are put in place to house pupils.
