FLOOD victims were overjoyed when Royal AM boss Shauwn “MaMkhize” Mkhize and the eThekwini Municipality handed over three new houses yesterday, 21 June. MaMkhize, who was accompanied by Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda, said she couldn’t bear seeing people suffer while she had the means to help. She said the situation reminds her of when her own house burnt down and she had nowhere to go. “At one stage, I was destitute without a house, so I understand how it feels,” said MaMkhize. The houses in Wybank, Durban, were fully furnished. The handover was part of the 20th birthday celebration of her construction company, Zikhulise Group. MaMkhize, who now lives in Joburg, said she decided to help when she heard about the flooding in Durban. “I know what I have done is going to change their lives because they have lost hope that they will have a home again,” she said. MaMkhize said this was not the end of her campaign. She was building 10 houses in Umlazi that will be handed over to the families soon. “I know what it feels like not to have a home, especially for the kids,” she said. Mmeli Sokhela from Clermont, who lost four kids to the floods, broke down in tears when she received a house. “I would have been overjoyed if my family was all here but that is not the case,” she said. “Today, I have a house. Thanks to MaMkhize and Mr Kaunda for assisting us,” she said. Nondumiso Cangcatha, who has two disabled sons, said: “I didn’t think I would get a new house so soon.”
