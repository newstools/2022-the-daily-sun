DRUG abuse is destroying future leaders. On Sunday, 26 June residents and NGOs took to the streets of Leondale, in Ekurhuleni, to mark International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. They also had discussions at Thembalenjabulo B&B in Leondale where various speakers spoke about the dangers of drugs. The aim of the march was to raise awareness about the physical and psychological impact of substance abuse, drug overdose deaths and drug-related problems across the globe. World Changers Candidates chairman, Lucas Mahlakgane, said the death of 20 youngsters at a tavern in the Eastern Cape has shocked the country. He said: “We send condolences to the families who lost their children. How sad it happened on the day that the World Changers Candidates try to highlight the dangers of drugs and substance abuse in our communities.” He added that the organisation was supported by various partners, including the Witpoort Recovery Centre, Sukuma Sakhe Development, Women Alive Soul Healing, Thembalenjabulo B&B, Banareng Printers, Mahlangu Production, Mangako Beauty Academy and Zondo Brothers. “As an anti-drug advocacy organisation, we are working closely with the youth as we work tirelessly in line with our motto of changing the world one soul at a time,” Lucas said. Pupils from Leondale High School were among the youth who took part in the march. Grade 12 pupil, Nceba Ngwenya (19), said the use of drugs was rife in communities. A 17-year-old grade 11 pupil said the youth must stay away from drugs. “Those who do drugs to seek help,” said the pupil.
