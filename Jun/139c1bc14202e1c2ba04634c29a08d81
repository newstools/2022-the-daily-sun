COMMUNITY members whose homes were damaged in the KZN floods in April received temporary residential units on Sunday, 12 May. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala handed over the units to residents of Ntshongweni, outside Durban, along with Human Settlements MEC Ntuthuko Jomo and eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda. Speaking at the handover, Zikalala said it marked two months since the floods caused havoc in five districts of eThekwini, leaving thousands homeless. “While for many of us it’s easy to speak about this disaster from the comfort of our homes and offices, the true test of the impact is seeing and hearing from the victims and those worst affected,” he said.
