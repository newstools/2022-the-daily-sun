THEY had been hijacking and killing motorists. And they even shot two cops, killing one, on the N12 Etwatwa off-ramp in Ekurhuleni recently. But on Monday, 27 June the thugs met their match when two of them were killed by private security as they were trying to hijack a truck. Sergeant Thmba Tshabalala of Springs Police Station said the N12 thugs forced the truck off the highway off-ramp and loaded the driver into their car. When a private security company’s guards passed by, they heard gunshots and went to investigate. The hijackers fired several shots at the guards but they shot back, killing two thugs. When the two other thugs saw the guards meant business, they sped off in their car but the guards gave chase. The hijackers’ car rolled over, tragically killing a cyclist who was passing by. The cyclist is believed to be from Sundra, near Delmas, in Mpumalanga. Sergeant Tshabalala said cops were looking for the suspects, who fled after the accident scene. He said the driver of the truck was found unharmed in the vehicle. Police believe the thugs are part of a syndicate, which has been terrorising motorists and truckers. Police are appealing to anyone who has information about the suspects to call 08600 10111.
