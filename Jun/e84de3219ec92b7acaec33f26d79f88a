NELSON Mandela Bay mayor, Eugene Johnson, is living in fear after she was allegedly threatened by her political advisor and a member of the mayoral committee. This after numerous disagreements on the appointment of city manager Noxolo Nqwazi, who happened to have won her unfair dismissal case against the municipality on Tuesday, 7 June in the Port Elizabeth High Court. In a video circulating on social media on Tuesday, Safety and Security MMC Lawrence Troon, and Johnson’s political advisor, Siyanda Mayana, confronted Johnson, her deputy, Buyelwa Mafaya, and chief whip, Wandisile Jikeka, at one of the restaurants in Gqeberha. Mayana can be heard shouting loudly saying: “We are going to deal with you and you are not going to last.” Johnson said: “What happened in that video was an unfortunate situation and all of us need to apologise for what happened. I felt threatened by them and the way they approached us and the language they used. “People are shooting each other in the city and our two ANC councillors have been shot and killed recently. I can’t take anything for granted when a person says: ‘I will deal with you’. It can be regarded as anything.” Mayana said: “When I say I will deal with them, I made it clear that I will deal with them politically not otherwise. The mayor has an obligation to defend any position of the council. It was against the law for her to support Qwazi and that left us with no choice but to remove her.” Speaking on behalf of block parties that are in coalition with the ANC, Gary Van Niekerk, said: “The coalition tracks started when we removed Qwazi. All of us need to take responsibility for this mess we found ourselves in because of the mayor. We are a laughing stock and we don’t want to be part of this chaos anymore.”
