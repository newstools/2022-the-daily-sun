NKHENSANI Mkhari is happy she conquered depression, which almost destroyed her life. She said she was confronted by this monster around 2016 when she was still studying at Boston Media College in Sandton, north of Joburg. She said she went through a lot of educational and family challenges at the time. The 31-year-old, who works at Power 98.7 as a marketing co-ordinator, said she felt she was getting little support from family and friends, which negatively affected her academic performance. “During those terrible times, I preferred to be alone. I could not focus at school and work,” she said. “I had several suicide attempts. I overdosed on tablets twice around 2017 and those were tablets meant to help me overcome the depression.” Nkhensani, who is based in Buccleuch in Joburg, said she got professional help. “Depression is terrible because I also became an alcoholic. I thought alcohol would ease the pain but it almost ruined my life.” She said turning to God in 2019 was the last option. “Every time depression attacks me, I turn to God and it leaves me alone,” she said. Nkhensani, who is also a gospel singer, said people would hear more about her life through her music – this is how she connects with God. “I fell in love with music as a teenager and played the classical guitar and violin at St John’s DSG School in Pietermaritzburg in KZN,” she said. Nkhensani’s dream is to have a show that empowers the community and the youth. She released a single titled Walk in the Spirit in 2020. She is working on an album due for release in April 2023.
