MANY commuters fear they will lose their jobs as taxi fares become too high. In Mamelodi, Tshwane, fares are set to increase from 1 July, and commuters are not happy. Taxis from the township to CBD and surrounding suburbs will go up to R25 from R20 while local ones go up to R15 from R12. Resident Wendy Mabena (30) said she was already struggling to pay fares. “We will suffer because transport and food are already expensive,” she said. Hawker Edward Mathabela (19) had fears of losing business as he would struggle to pay to go to town. “People will be working for transport money and take nothing home.” He said he knew fuel prices had hiked, but he had hoped it would only be by R1 or R2. Resident Sibusiso Vilakazi (18) said people would stop taking taxis and rather use trains and buses. “I was shocked to hear about the new fares. The fuel increase is the cause.” Tshepang Mamabolo (58) said: “Salaries are not increasing but food, petrol and transport costs are.” Sharon Nkosi (44) said they were suffering. “We don’t know what is happening in South Africa anymore. Everything is increasing,” she said. Spokesman of the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) in Tshwane, McDonald Makata, said operators were aware it would affect business, but had no choice as taxis were being repossessed by banks. “There is no way we cannot increase fares when fuel has increased so much.”
