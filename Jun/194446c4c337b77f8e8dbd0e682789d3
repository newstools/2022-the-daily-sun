BELLA Phala needs help with her house. The 43-year-old from Saulsville, Tshwane, said the roof of the house she inherited from her late mum was damaged during a heavy rainfall in February. The unemployed mum of three told Daily Sun: “The roof collapsed and since then, we have not been able to fix it. Before my mum passed away two months ago, she used to complain about the strong wind coming into her bedroom. Unfortunately, she died of pneumonia.” Bella said her mum would sleep in the dining room as she couldn’t stand the cold in her room. “I’ve knocked on several doors for help but no one is able to assist me and my three children. Daily Sun is my last hope,” she said. Bella told the SunTeam she depended on her children’s grants and hoped a Good Samaritan would help her fix the house. Councillor Abbey Sebola said: “I’ve written letters to various hardware stores. Unfortunately, no positive response. We’ll continue knocking on doors till we get help,” he said.
