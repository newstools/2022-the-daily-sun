THEIR yards have become wetlands and now, they struggle to sleep as frogs make noise all night. Residents of Ga-Rankuwa zone 1, Tshwane, told Daily Sun that they were living in fear that their houses would collapse on them one day. They said the problem started in 2018 when water started coming from the ground in one of the yards, and then spread to neighbours. They didn’t know what caused the problem, but it was briefly solved when the municipal workers dug a hole in one of the yards. Violet Mekgwe (54) said they had tried to address the matter with councillors, but nothing happened. “We don’t know what to do anymore. At first, people from the municipality said it could be caused by a burst pipe, but it was never found,” she said. “We’ve been living here since 1976, but we never had this problem before. Our kids do not even play outside. We really need help.” Emily Maroleng (50) said the water first started coming out of the ground in her yard. “The municipality came to dig in 2018, but never found the root of the problem. The water stopped in 2021, but then it came back,” she said. Reuben Maditse (34) said he lost tenants because of the problem. He added that municipal workers came to assess, but never got to the root of the problem. Municipal spokesman Sipho Stuurman said the council would work to resolve the matter speedily. “This is not the type of service we want to be known for. This is not the experience we want for our residents. With the 2022/23 budget, we’re focusing on basic service delivery and infrastructure, maintenance and development.”
