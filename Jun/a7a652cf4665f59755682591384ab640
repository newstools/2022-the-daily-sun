KGOSI Kwena of ActionSA said when his party takes over, it will make sure local municipalities function properly. The North West party leader was speaking at the launch of nine branches in Moretele on Saturday, 4 June. He said the launch was part of the party’s programme to expand across the province and the country ahead of the 2024 election campaign. Kwena said municipal workers needed to know they were not just working for themselves and had to provide basic services to residents. “The people of North West have suffered in silence for far too long. It’s time to reclaim the province from incompetent government officials who have held the province back for far too long. “We need to replace them with ethical and competent leaders who will prioritise the needs of society ahead of party political interests,” he said. “This is a very big day for us as the party. We are preparing for 2024 because we want to take over government so we can better the lives of our people.

Solly Hlongwane (46) said he had been struggling to get a house. He said a foundation was laid, but no house was built. He said his life was challenging as he had to buy water, electricity and put food on the table with the R350 grant he was getting from the government. David Tembe of ActionSA’s senate said he attended the event to support Kwena in his journey to change the lives of the people of Moretele. He said the challenge of water was worrying, but he believed the new branches would work hard to bring change to communities.
