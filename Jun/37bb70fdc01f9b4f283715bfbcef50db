COPS in Delft are investigating after a woman’s body was found dumped in the middle of reeds inside a plastic bag near Delft Mall. The body was discovered on Monday, 27 June, at around 11am but it is still not clear when it was dumped. According to police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk, cops were informed by a person who was burning copper in the open field that he saw a bag in the water. He opened the bag and saw the body of a person inside and immediately contacted the police. Van Wyk said the identity of the woman is yet to be determined and she could approximately be in her mid-20s. A resident who spoke to Daily Sun said she heard about the incident from the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) workers who were cleaning the area.

Last month we saw the body of a baby that was dumped at the same place,” said Yandisa Sindilima (40), who stays in the area. Community leader Levi Swartbooi said they were shocked. “We cannot have people killing people and dumping them in our area. Cops must arrest the killers and bring justice and closure to the family that has lost their loved one. We are not clear whether the person is from the other parts of Delft or from outside Delft but she is definitely not from around here. We are not aware of any missing person from our neighbourhood,” he said. “Delft police are investigating a murder case after the body of an unknown female wrapped in a bag was found lying between the reeds on an open field earlier today (Monday) at about 11am. Anyone with information about this incident is kindly requested to contact SAPS Delft at 021 954 9011 or 082 522 2036,” said Van Wyk.
