THE Pretoria Regional Court has postponed the trial of Limpopo businessman Maphoko Kgomoeswana in the Eskom corruption and fraud case to 21 July. The hearing was meant to sit on Tuesday, 7 June, but was postponed after his attorney had other commitments. Kgomoeswana stands accused of tax evasion in his personal and representative capacity for his company, Babinatlou Business Services, between 2016 and 2018. According to Investigating Directorate spokeswoman Sindisiwe Seboka, the tax fraud charges were discovered during the investigation of the controversial R745 million Eskom Kusile power station corruption case. She said the businessman and his company are accused of facilitating bribes in the fraud and corruption matter, which returned to court on 30 March, and he’s out on R300 000 bail in that matter. “Kgomoeswana was also slapped with a restraint order on 21 July 2021 and the restraint of his assets confirmed on 6 September 2021, to the value of R1,4 billion along with his co-accused, former Tubular Construction Projects CEO Antonio Trindade, his wife, Tubular Construction Projects as well as former Eskom senior manager for Capital Contracts, France Hlakudi,” she said.
