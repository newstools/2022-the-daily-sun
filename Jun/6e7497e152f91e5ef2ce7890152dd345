THE search for Khayalethu Magadla has come to an end, but Joburg Emergency Medical Services (EMS) still has its ear to the ground. Tragically, the 13-day search for the six-year-old, who fell down a manhole in Dlamini, Soweto, on 12 June has not yielded any results. On Saturday, 25 June, Joburg EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi told Daily Sun the rescue team completed its search at the split chamber with Croc Rescue. He said since the search started, they had searched through a 13km stretch, which covers 23 manholes and three pipelines. They also used technology from Delta Scan, including high quality cameras. Mulaudzi said the search team handed the search over to Joburg Water to continue monitoring at its main plant. On Sunday, Mulaudzi visited the family to give an update. He told members of the family not to hesitate to contact the EMS if they wanted the team to explore certain areas. “Although this is hard for the family, they have commended the team for working hard in the search for their boy,” said Mulaudzi. Residents plan to hold weekly prayer sessions for Khaya and to send love and light to the family. Sipho Msiza said: “At this point, no one knows where this young man is but we trust God will guide us. We can only hopeful that his body will be found.”
