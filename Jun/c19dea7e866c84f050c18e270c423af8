PUPILS at Ramotshodi Secondary School are forced to pee in the bushes. This is because the toilets at the school in Maologane Village, North West, are blocked and filthy. A pupil said the toilets were in a horrible condition and the school had never done anything to fix them. “The condition the toilets are in is embarrassing. hey are dirty and the smell is unbearable. “We need the health department to intervene because our health is at risk and our dignity is lost. “It’s dangerous going to the bushes as anything might bite you while peeing.

Other pupils said they used buckets but the smell was terrible. “I’d rather wait until school is out to use the toilet at home,” said one pupil. The provincial education spokesman, Elias Malindi, said he was not aware of the situation and the matter would be investigated. “This is a newly-built school handed over with fully-functional flush toilets. “Therefore, we don’t expect the toilets to be in such a bad condition but we will follow up on the issue,” he said.
