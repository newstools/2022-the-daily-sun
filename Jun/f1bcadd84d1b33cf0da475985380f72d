Her mum, Promise, from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni, said on the day Zinhle’s body was found, (Friday, 17 June), she was supposed to have celebrated her birthday. She said on the day her daughter was last seen, her friends had visited her and she escorted them out as they do not live far. “We are told she met the suspect on her way home and he forced her to go with him. The next thing, my daughter was dead. “She was not the type who slept out and I thought maybe her friends convinced her to stay with them as it was her birthday the following day,” she said.
