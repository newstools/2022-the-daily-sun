THEY’VE been robbing and killing motorists for years, and police have come up with a plan to stop them but now the thugs are attacking cops. On Monday night, 13 June, two cops from Benoni Police Station in Ekurhuleni were shot. One died while the other was wounded after they were attacked while patrolling the N12 Etwatwa off-ramp. Daily Sun has reported on how thugs have been targeting motorists, in some cases killing men and raping women on the N12. They often put spikes on the road to damage tyres, forcing motorists to stop. The Springs and Benoni cops have recently been working together to patrol the area. Earlier this year, three suspects were bust in Holfontein and found in possession of 14 wrist watches, three pocket watches, five toy guns, gas canisters, a torch and 69 rounds of ammunition for an R1 rifle. They were charged with possession of live ammunition and suspected stolen property. Cops are investigating whether the suspects were involved in the robberies and killings under the bridge, just after the Etwatwa off-ramp. This after close to 100 cases were opened of motorists and truck drivers being attacked on the N12. National police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe said: “Police in Gauteng have launched a manhunt for an unknown number of suspects who shot and killed a warrant officer and wounded a constable attached to the Benoni Flying Squad. Those with information are urged to report it to the nearest police station or call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or on MYSAPS App. “All information will be treated with confidentiality.”
