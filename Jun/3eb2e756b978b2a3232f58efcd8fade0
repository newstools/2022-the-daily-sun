RURAL COMMUNITIES around Rustenburg are tired of bad roads. They said life became difficult when it rained as buses and taxis were unable to reach them. They raised their concerns during the recent Bojanala District Municipality budget speech, saying the government had failed to provide proper roads. Resident Mothusi Mogale said: “Our gravel roads are not upgraded. We have tried several times to bring this matter to relevant authorities.” Mothusi said they had lost hope in government. EFF chief whip Tebogo Hlongwane said the budget didn’t reflect what communities wanted. “We do not support fruitless expenditure and expenses, which are not reflected on the budget. “The mayoral committee must prioritise projects that favour our people,” he said. Mayor Matlakala Nondzaba said service delivery would be prioritised. Nondzaba said R2,5 million was allocated to the rural roads asset management system. “This programme aims to address the unavailability of road network information.”
