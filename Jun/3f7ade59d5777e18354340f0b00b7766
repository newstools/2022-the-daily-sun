ZAHARA is sick and this has forced her to cancel her gigs. On Saturday 4 June, the singer announced on social media that she would not attend any of her gigs over the weekend. This led to fans sending her prayers and wishing her well. This included two gigs which were scheduled to take place on Sunday, 5 June. However, it was not clear if the events were cancelled or postponed. She wrote on social media: “I’d like to apologise to my fans and promoters and share that I am unable to carry through my performances this weekend. “My health has taken a toll on me and I have been advised to be on bed rest. I look forward to getting out there as soon as I am physically fit. #CountryGirlLovesYou.” ALSO READ: DJ Shimza loses a loved one The post was accompanied by a photo of herself in doctors’ rooms.
