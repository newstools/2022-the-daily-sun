The ANC Women’s League in Thabo Mofutsanyana region called for the death penalty. Chairwoman and former mayor Masetjhaba Mosia-Lakaje said the country needed serious amendment on the Constitution. “We have pronounced our position on gender-based violence. This is slowly turning into a pandemic. How can a person butcher their own mother? Our parliamentarians should reinstate the death penalty as it’s the only solution to end GBV,” she said. She added that it was obvious that men had declared war against women, who were vulnerable. “We are sick and tired of being killed everyday. We need justice to prevail,” said Mosia-Lakaje.
