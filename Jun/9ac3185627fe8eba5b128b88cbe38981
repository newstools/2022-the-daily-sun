THE family of six-year-old Khayalethu Magadla, who fell into a manhole in Soweto’s Dlamini, is praying that the little one is found, as the search for him continues. They’re also putting their hope on the team from the City of Joburg to find their child. The boy’s father, Kholekile Magadla, said he blames the City of Joburg for negligence. “I’m hoping that he’s still alive but I can see that there’s a very small chance that he’s actually alive,” said Kholekile.  The Joburg EMS spokesman, Robert Mulaudzi, told Daily Sun that Khayalethu fell into the manhole on Sunday at about 3pm “Three of them were playing when this happened. The family opened a missing persons case and when the two friends where asked about Khayalethu, they told the family that he fell into the manhole,” he said.  Mulaudzi said yesterday they received a call from the family and they immediately started with the search, which hasn’t been successful so far.  “We haven’t located anything so far but the EMS, together with the city of Johannesburg, are working hard to try find him,” he said. Mulaudzi has appealed to adults to monitor and caution children against playing near manholes and drains.
