CHAOS broke out at Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) in Umlazi, south of Durban, at the crack of dawn on Thursday, 23 June. This as students overpowered the security guards and went on a rampage burning infrastructure and a car before escaping. However, it is still not clear what led to the incident, which resulted in the suspension of classes and exams, which were supposed to take place on Thursday, 23 June. When the SunTeam visited the campus, guards were at the gate and students going to the campus were told to go back home. Those who live on campus stayed inside. One student told Daily Sun he was asleep when the torching took place.  “I don’t know what happened. I just woke up to find that this had happened. We have now been told that all classes have been dismissed,” said the student. Most of the students didn’t want to talk to the People’s Paper as they were not part of the torching and had no clue what led to the incident. On Thursday morning, the university announced on its official Facebook page that staff and students should not go to campus. “It is with sadness and shock that the university has woken up to malicious damage on campus.  “Regrettably, all classes will be suspended today and all the planned examinations for today are all suspended. All staff and students should not come to campus today,” read the statement. It further stated that protection services had beefed up security and that the university will apply its disciplinary procedures accordingly.  KZN police spokeswoman Constable Thenjisiwe Ngcobo confirmed the incident. “No injuries have been reported. Charges of malicious damage to property and arson were opened at Umlazi Police Station for investigation. Police are monitoring the situation,” said Ngcobo.
