TSHEPO Mmusi (37) killed his father, William Mmusi (60). But when he initially went to the police in October last year, he only reported his dad missing. But he later admitted to his crimes when he was interviewed by the police, saying that he had killed and burnt his father’s body. For these crimes, he was sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Atamelaneng Magistrates Court in the North West on Thursday, 9 June. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said in a statement that provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena welcomed the sentence handed down to Tshepo for killing his father. Myburgh said Tshepo was sentenced after he entered a plea bargain with the state. “The court heard evidence that Tshepo initially reported that his father, William, went missing on Thursday, 12 October 2021. “However, two days later on Saturday, 14 October, he admitted during an interview with police that he murdered his father and burnt his body. As a result, the body was found at Ramabesa in Setlagole and Tshepo was arrested. He remained in custody throughout the duration of the court case,” Myburgh said. “Due to an excellent investigation by Sergeant Mbulelo Victor Isake of the Setlagole police, Tshepo was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment.”
