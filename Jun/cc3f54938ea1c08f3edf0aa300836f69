MM PLATINUM sealed their promotion to the GladAfrica Championship next season in style following a 1-0 win over Limpopo side Magesi FC in the ABC Motsepe League national play-offs final at Olen Park Stadium yesterday. Sipho Mahlangu scored the all-important goal in the 74th minute as he lobbed the ball over a bemused Magesi keeper Tebogo Semenya to the delight of their fans.   Platinum smiled all the way to the bank having pocketed R1million first prize.  They also won an additional R250 000 they will use to uplift their community. Magesi received R600 000 for finishing second. Magesi and Platinum came into the match having already secured their spot in the Championship. They took the places of Jomo Cosmos and TS Sporting who finished 15th and 16th in the Championship were relegated to the ABC Motsepe League. A lot was expected from the likes of Summerfield Dynamos of KwaZulu-Natal when the play-offs started last Tuesday considering their incredible performances that saw them reach the quarterfinals of Nedbank Cup where they lost 5-0 to eventual winners Mamelodi Sundown. But it was never meant to be as Jack Ledwaba’s Magesi FC and Ashraf Hendricks’ Platinum reached the final. Ledwaba, who played for AmaZulu, is familiar with the play-offs having helped  Magesi to gain promotion in the 2016-17 season via the same route, but they only spent one season in the Championship before they got relegated.
