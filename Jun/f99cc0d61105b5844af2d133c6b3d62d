ALL they wanted was a wage increase of R2 per house. But they ended up going blind and losing their jobs! Nothel Khoza (23) and Thokozani Thwala (35) were seriously wounded when security guards allegedly shot at them during a peaceful march at Vibro Bricks and Paving in Rosslyn, Tshwane, on 8 April. Nothel, from Rebecca View in Ga-Rankuwa, said the protest was peaceful and they were shot with no provocation. “We were also dismissed for protesting illegally. “A security guard shot a warning bullet into the air, and we never suspected that the next shots would take our eyes,” he said. Nothel said a guard allegedly shot at their faces while they were trying to talk to him. “I need compensation because I will never see in that eye again,” he said. Thokozani said he was struggling to cope with only one eye.  He said the company destroyed his life for taking part in a legal protest. “I want the company to pay because it called guards to shoot at us. “We will not rest until we get justice,” he said. He said he wanted the company to explain why guards were called to shoot at them. Company director Leon van Aardt said the two were dismissed for misconduct. “We are, however, not aware of any injuries to the two employees. Your inquiry was the first time we became aware of the allegations and we will investigate. We have no further comment,” said Van Aardt. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a joint attempted murder case was opened.
