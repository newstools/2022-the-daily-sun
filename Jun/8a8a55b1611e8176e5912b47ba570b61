FLAMBOYANT Hamilton Ndlovu has been ordered to pay back R158 million he received from the fraudulent Covid-19 personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts. The Special Tribunal on Tuesday, 7 June, further ordered that Ndlovu forfeits assets and be blacklisted from doing business with the state. The orders come at the back of the court’s decision that reviewed and set aside the R172 million PPE contracts awarded to the controversial businessman by the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS). Judge Lebogang Modiba granted an order that declared as “unconstitutional, invalid, irregular” and ordered the contracts awarded to Hamilton fronting with his companies Bugatti Security Services and Projects (Pty) Ltd, Hamilton Holdings (Pty) Ltd, Mok Plus One (Pty) Ltd, Abompetha (Pty) Ltd, Feliham (Pty) Ltd, Persto (Pty) Ltd and Kgodume Mokone Trading Enterprises (Pty) Ltd. The Special Tribunal also ordered the NHLS to invoke provisions of Section 15 of the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework to enlist Hamilton and his companies to be restricted from doing business with the state. Ndlovu became an instant social media hit in 2020 when he posted videos of luxurious cars, including a Jeep Grand Cherokee, three Porsches and a Lamborghini Urus worth R11 million. Ndlovu’s assets, including the flashy cars, will within 120 court days be sold at a public auction. “The proceeds of the auctioned assets will be disbursed in the net proceeds to a bank account designated by the NHLS,” said Modiba. The judge found that of the R172 million, Ndlovu has to pay an amount of R158 million as the applicants, Special Investigating Unit (SIU), have not successfully placed evidence regarding the discrepancies between the contract value amount and the enrichment claim in the amount of R13 891 253.
