COPS responded to a robbery complaint in the squatter camp but little did they know they were also going to be robbed. The armed members of the notorious gang grabbed their state phones and left. The incident happened at Everest squatter camp in Spring, Ekurhuleni, last week. The cops called for back-up and their colleagues came in numbers to hunt for the Basotho gang. When the perpetrators heard that the cops were looking for them, they gave the two cellphones to a passing motorist and begged him to drop them off at the police station. The gang told the motorist to tell the police to leave them in peace. The motorist took the phones to the police station and relayed the message. Colonel Dimakatso Sello of Gauteng police confirmed that the two cellphones were recovered and that the cops were hunting for the suspects. She said the police were responding to a robbery when they were attacked. “They were stopped by members of the gang and their cellphones were taken,” she said. The phones were used by members of sector policing and were not personal cellphones. Some residents said the gang had to be stopped. “Cops did well by coming back for them. This is sheer disrespect for our police. We are tired of this gang that is terrorising the residents,” said resident Dipuo Lejwe. “They think they own the squatter camp and it has to stop!”
