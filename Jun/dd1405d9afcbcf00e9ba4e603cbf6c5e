THREE police officers from Kakamas, Northern Cape, who rescued a bed-ridden madala and three children from a burning house, have been praised for their heroic actions. On the evening of Saturday, 18 June, Sergeant Neville Mouton, Constable Melvin de Wee and reservist Constable Ricardo van Wyk were patrolling in Witrand when they noticed a house that was burning. They quickly gathered water in buckets to extinguish the fire. Van Wyk then decided to enter the house and rescue the occupants. With the front door already engulfed in flames, he broke the window to gain access to the madala. He then carried him to the window, where he managed to hand him over to police members outside who took him to safety. Following that, a child was heard crying in the house and again, Van Wyk climbed back through the window and found three children on a bed, aged two, four and 11. He grabbed and handed them over to other members.  The fire, of which the cause was being investigated, was later extinguished but the house was badly damaged. Relatives of the madala and children have expressed their gratitude towards the three members in saving their family. Station Commander Colonel Dries Witbooi thanked the cops for putting their lives at risk to ensure the safety of community members.
