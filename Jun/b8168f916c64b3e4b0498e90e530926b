FORMER Life Esidimeni managing director Dr Morgan Mkhatshwa maintains that patients were handed over to NGOs with adequate medical records. On Tuesday, 7 June, Mkhatshwa was cross-examined by Advocate Ebenezer Prophy, representing three NGOs, at the judicial inquest into the Life Esidimeni marathon project, which led to the deaths of 144 mental health patients. Prophy questioned Mkhatshwa on what was considered to be adequate medical records. He said this would be a discharge summary and a list of medication. Mkhatshwa previously testified that patients were released with their discharge summaries, following allegations by NGO officials that patients had no medical records on arrival. Prophy read out a list of patients transferred from Life Esidimeni facilities to the Masego Home from May 2016. He said they had no prescriptions and outdated periodical reports. Some of the patients had diabetes, hypertension, shortness of breath and severe intellectual disabilities. Mkhatshwa said Life Esidimeni clinicians handed over patients to a clinical team from the Gauteng Health Department. He said clinicians would not have accepted patients without sufficient medical records. “Prescriptions might have been lost in transmission. I cannot account for the transmission of mental healthcare users,” he said. The inquest was established to determine the cause of death of the 144 patients, and whether anyone could be held criminally responsible.
