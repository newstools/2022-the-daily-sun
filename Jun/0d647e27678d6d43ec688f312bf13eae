THE defence lawyer of accused two and three in the Hillary Gardee murder case has lambasted the state for postponing the matter. Sipho Mkhatshwa (39), Philemon Lukhele (47) and Mduduzi Gama (52) appeared in the Mbombela Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Thursday, 9 June. State prosecutor Ntsika Mpolweni asked for a postponement until 22 July for further investigations, determination of the trial forum and preparation of the indictments. Ntsika said the DNA and ballistic reports as well as cellphone analysis and other statements were still outstanding.

They were arrested last month after Hillary’s body was found dumped at a timber plantation outside Mbombela. Nqobizitha Mlilo, representing Lukhele and Gama, said the state had asked for a postponement during the first court appearance, yet it was asking for another one. Mlilo said the defence was ready for trial, and intended to plead not guilty.
