FORMER MKMVA spokesman Carl Niehaus will this morning Monday, 13 June lead a group of Gauteng ANC members to open criminal charges against President Cyril Ramaphosa in relation to the robbery on his Phala Phala farm in Limpopo. Niehaus, in a press alert, revealed that he and the group will open the charges ranging from money laundering, kidnapping and corruption against Ramaphosa at the Rosebank Police Station. The charges would be in addition to those that were opened by former spy boss and correctional services commissioner, Arthur Fraser at the same station on 1 June, which has sparked calls for the president to step down from his position, while the matter is being probed. Ramaphosa has been steadfast in brushing aside calls for him to step aside, arguing that by doing so he’d be admitting that he would interfere with the investigations into the matter. Niehaus, a staunch former president Jacob Zuma supporter who was last year suspended from the party for inflammatory speech, said the group was laying the charges to hold Ramaphosa accountable and as part of the campaign to force him to resign as ANC president and that of the country. “All South Africans are urged to lay similar charges,” urged Niehaus.
