THE Special Investigating Unit (SIU) needs more forensic accountants to bolster its war on corruption. On Monday, 30 May, the agency signed a new partnership with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants’ Thuthuka Education Upliftment Fund and the North West University to ensure the unit is well capacitated in the future. The three institutions established a bursary fund to train forensic accountants to be deployed within the SIU. The bursary will be funded by the SIU to the tune of R10 million and it will run for four years with an option to renew it. Speaking during the signing of the partnership, SIU head Advocate Andy Mothibi said the university will train and produce a new generation of forensic accountants to fight the scourge of fraud and corruption in South Africa. He said criminals and their criminality have become more complex and the use of forensic accountants in investigation was becoming a top requirement. “The corrupt and the criminals out there use sophisticated tools and ways to commit crime. “They use sophisticated methods to hide the money and assets that they have corruptly acquired,” said Mothibi. He said six years ago, the unit had a forensic accounting team that was understaffed. “We need to up the game in terms of ensuring that we meet them pound for pound. We need to ensure we have the skills that will analyse all those financial statements, all those balance sheets, all those income statements to ensure that we come to grips to the kind of offences and corruption that has been committed,” he said.
