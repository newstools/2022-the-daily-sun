NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has shot down political parties request to probe under fire President Cyril Ramaphosa’s alleged cover-up of a robbery at his game farm in Limpopo. In rejecting the requests, Mapisa-Nqakula dismissed them as lacking in law for her to initiate any action against he president as requested by the parties. After a criminal charge was opened against Ramaphosa by former spy boss and correctional services commissioner Arthur Fraser, UDM and ATM wrote to the speaker asking for a parliamentary process to hold Ramaphosa to account while he is on sabbatical leave. The speaker rejected both. She revealed that the UDM submission that Parliament must compel Ramaphosa to take sabbatical leave had no legal basis on any law that existed. Also the submission to initiate any parliamentary inquiry was not accompanied by a substantive motion as envisaged in the rules. “For Parliament to undertake such an inquiry, there must be basis in the Constitution, the law or rules which the assembly would rely upon. The UDM has not made such a case. Similarly, the ATM’s request did not constitute nor was it accompanied by a substantive motion for a Section 89 enquiry to be initiated, as required in the rules. The rules further indicate that such a motion must be limited to a formulated and substantiated charge, and all evidence for consideration must be attached. These requirements were not complied with in the ATM’s submission,” she said. The speaker further said there was no provision in the Executive Members’ Ethics Act (1998) for the referral to the National Assembly of allegations of breaches by the president.
