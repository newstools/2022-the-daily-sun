THE dreaded Day Zero has come. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has confirmed it is no longer able to take water from Impofu Dam as the water level is too low. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “On Wednesday, 8 June, the municipality shut down the water supply from Churchill and Impofu dams to carry out repairs. As the maintenance team inspected the dam levels of Impofu Dam, it was discovered that the levels are too low for the dam to operate any further. “The pumps were switched off as the dam level has now dropped to a point that is risky for drawing up water. This immediately leaves the city with a water deficit of about 28 megalitres per day. “As an interim measure, the metro is taking more water from the Kouga Dam to make up the deficit but this can only be done in the short term. “Even the Churchill Dam, which is also supplying water to the city, is at a critical level. It is, therefore, critical that water is only used for essential purposes like cooking, drinking and washing. Water trucks will be deployed to the affected areas.”  Nelson Mandela Bay is experiencing a severe drought, which has left the total dam levels at 12%. This has been made worse by ageing water infrastructure, wasting 30% of water on leaks. Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu took over the city’s Water Services Directorate early in June. He appointed the Amatola Water Board to manage the situation. The situation has severely affected businesses that rely on water. Automat Laundry owner Odessa Perelson said: “Since Thursday, 9 June, the water pressure has been so low that nothing is coming out of the taps. “This is worse than Covid-19 because we have staff unable to do anything. We are praying for rain as there is nothing we can do.”
