SIPHO Mkhatshwa, one of the three men accused of murdering Hillary Gardee, has been fired by the City of Ekurhuleni. Mkhatshwa worked as an integrated development plan facilitator in the city’s strategy and corporate planning department. Municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini confirmed that Mkhatshwa was dismissed. However, he said he would not be sharing the details at present. Mkhatshwa was suspended after he and two others were arrested in connection with the death of Hillary, the daughter of former EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee, in Mpumalanga in May. They are facing charges of kidnapping, rape, murder, possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition and defeating the ends of justice. Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF)’s Ekurhuleni chairman Nkululeko Dunga said they welcomed the dismissal. “We are happy the city has taken this matter seriously. “It was raised by the EFF to ensure this guy is dismissed because we cannot harbour criminals, especially when it’s such a gruesome crime,” he said. “We welcome the decision for Mkhatshwa to be removed from the payroll of taxpayers in the city.” He said in the future, the EFF would have a Gardee clause, which would require people to declare if they had been convicted of a crime against a woman. “This guy was working for the city for the longest time. It’s only now when you start investigating that you hear ladies saying that he was a weird character,” he said.
