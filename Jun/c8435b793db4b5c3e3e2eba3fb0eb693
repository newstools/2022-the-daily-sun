GIFT of the Givers are drilling boreholes to alleviate the water crisis in Nelson Mandela Bay, Eastern Cape. The drilling team started its intervention at Alpha Primary School in Galvandale by drilling the first of 10 boreholes. About R5 million has been budgeted to drill the sites selected by a geologist to mitigate Day Zero. Some areas in Nelson Mandela Bay have already experienced Day Zero after the municipality stopped pumping out water from Impofu Dam as the water could not be extracted. The organisation’s founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said: “We’ve been monitoring the situation in this area, waiting to see what government’s response would be. Then the calls started coming from the public, the municipality and the business chamber. It is then when we realised that the situation is critical. This initiative of mitigating drought can’t be done alone by government. That is why we are here with our drilling team.” Municipal Water Distribution director, Joseph Tsatsire, said the metro has been experiencing intermittent water supply for the past few months. “One of our floating pumps could suck water out of the dam and it resulted in a short supply of water to the western side of the city that now is being interpreted as Day Zero. “The last time we had our dams full was in November 2015 and since then our dams are decreasing up to 12%,” said Tsatsire. Resident Masixole Velezantsi said: “Gift of the Givers’ intervention to mitigate drought means a lot to residents as we were starting to panic.”
