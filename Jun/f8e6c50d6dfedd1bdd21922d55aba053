A DEVIOUS husband, who pushed his wife off a cliff in order to cash in on her life insurance policy, is trying to avoid a 30-year prison sentence. Hakan Aysal (41) lured his pregnant wife to a cliff top beauty spot for a selfie before pushing her down. He is now appealing his sentence, claiming he was not mentally fit to stand trial. Turkey’s Fethiye Heavy Penal Court gave him an aggravated life sentence on 15 February for the murder of his wife, Semra Aysal (33), who was seven months pregnant. Under Turkish law, he would not be eligible for parole for 30 years. READ: Rosemary Ndlovu’s lawyers fearful! According to The Mirror, in June 2018, Aysal forced his heavily pregnant wife, who was afraid of heights, to go to a cliff top. Once at the beauty spot, he kept her waiting for three hours for tourists to leave so he could carry out the evil act discreetly. The publication reports that he then used the cash from seven loans and a personal accident insurance policy, that he had taken out in her name prior to her death, to fund a life of luxury before the law caught up with him.
