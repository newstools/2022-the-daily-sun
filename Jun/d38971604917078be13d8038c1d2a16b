THE 16-year-old girl who was arrested for allegedly killing her two-week-old baby has been released by the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court into the care of her parents on Monday, 6 June. She will be assessed and a report will be put together by probation officers soon. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said: “She was expected to meet a probation officer on 6 June, and will possibly attend court again later in the week.” She was arrested by Calcutta police at her home in Cunningmore, outside Mkhuhlu, in Mpumalanga on Thursday, 2 June. Mohlala said the baby’s gogo woke up to find that the child was missing. “The grandmother searched for the infant but couldn’t find her. “She also asked the baby’s mother about the child’s whereabouts, but she apparently refused to speak,” said Mohlala. “The grandmother reported the matter to the police, who questioned the baby’s mother. She apparently admitted that she killed the baby and stuffed her body in a school bag. She led the police to the room where she hid the bag. The girl was later arrested.” Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela expressed her shock at the minor’s arrest. “This is a tragic and unfortunate incident,” said Manamela. “We advise young mothers to seek assistance from relevant organisations and their familiesand their families to lessen the burden in order to prevent such tragic incidents.” Events like these should never happen.”
