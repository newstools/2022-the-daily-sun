COPS are investigating a case of business robbery after four armed men targeted a traffic department at the Enoch Mgijima Municipality on Friday, 17 June. According to Captain Namhla Mdleleni, at about 6.30am, it is alleged that four unknown men entered the premises pretending to come for renovations. “While they were being attended to, all four drew firearms and held employees at gunpoint and demanded cash. The suspects managed to steal an undisclosed amount of cash before fleeing the scene,” Mdleleni said. She said the suspects are still at large. Mdleleni urged anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to contact the investigating officer Lieutenant-Colonel Ntombekhaya Mahlanza on 082 319 7944.
