SASSA in Mpumalanga has urged all R350 social relief grant recipients to re-apply. Provincial spokesman Senzeni Ngubeni confirmed the news, saying the Sassa customer care unit had received many enquiries from worried beneficiaries. “Clients assumed that they would automatically be in the payment cycle of April 2022 - March 2023. The disaster terms and regulations have been repealed and new regulations have been published by the department of social development,” he said. Ngubeni said those struggling to re-register on the website should use the WhatsApp number 082 046 8553.

Ngubeni said applicants needed to ensure their personal details were correctly captured and be careful of scammers trying to get their personal details. “If they choose the cellphone payment option, they must RICA their cellphone numbers first to avoid disqualification or their application being turned down,” he said.
