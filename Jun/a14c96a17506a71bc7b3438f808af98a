VUSI “Khekhe” Mathibela and his three co-accused will know their fate on Thursday, 23 June. Mathibela, sometimes called Mamelodi’s number-one tsotsi, Matamela Mutapa, Bonginkosi Khumalo and Sipho Hudla are facing charges of murder and attempted murder. The four have been on trial in the North Gauteng High Court, Tshwane, for the murder of North West businessman Wandile Bozwana and attempted murder of his business partner Mpho Baloyi. The two were shot at the Garsfontein off-ramp on the N1 in Tshwane in 2015. The four have been in custody for three years, with Mathibela’s bail having been revoked in 2019 for violating conditions. On Wednesday, 22 June, Judge Papi Mosopa went through the evidence given during the trial. Before delivering judgment, the judge read a statement that Mathibela was at Sandton Square, Joburg, while Bozwana and Baloyi shopped there before the shooting. He also read a statement claiming that Mathibela was the one who ordered the hit. The court heard the alleged murderers were given R60 000 to share thereafter. Mosopa said it was also in evidence that the cellphones of the accused were picked up by towers not far from the scene of the crime. “This doesn’t mean the people were personally on the scene, but their cellphones were.” He also read out the state’s claims that the victims were followed from Sandton Square to a salon and McDonald’s restaurant before heading back to Tshwane on the N1. The judgment was rolled over until Thursday, 23 June.
