TWO sisters and their brother were laid to rest on Saturday, 11 June. The three siblings from Ivory Park in Ekurhuleni died after eating meat laced with Galephirime poison. The brother (6) is alleged to have climbed a chair and a window’s burglar bars to be able to get the plate of meat placed on top of a tall fridge in their home. He then shared the meat, which was meant for rats, with his siblings. Their gogo got the shock of her life when she saw the empty plate in the sink. When she asked them who took the plate on top of the fridge, the eldest confessed. By the time gogo Sarah Ngobeni (72) gave them milk, the poison was at an advanced stage. Sadly Sherley (1), Mpho (6) and Lerato Ngobeni (8) died on 31 May. No words could comfort their mother, Siphiwe Ngobeni (35), who was crying uncontrollably during the funeral service held at Waterval Cemetery in Midrand. Captain Bernard Matimulane of Ivory Park Police Station said an inquest docket has been opened. The children, aged eight and six, were pupils at Kaalfontein Primary School.
