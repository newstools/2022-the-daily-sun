IN AN effort to improve service delivery, the Department of Home Affairs will be launching a pilot project to ease the passport renewal process for South Africans living in the United Kingdom. Home Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said: “The new passport service will advance the department’s movement from manual, paper-based processes to digital systems, for smart, faster and reliable services. With this system in place our citizens in the UK will no longer wait for extended periods when renewing their passports. This will also ease space constraints at South Africa’s embassy in London.” Home Affairs is extending its partnership with VFS (Visa Facilitation Services) Global to implement the pilot in the UK, which will be receiving applications for passport reissues at its new centres in the three cities, Manchester, London and Edinburgh. Jiten Vyas, regional group chief operating officer for VFS Global, said: “We would like to thank the Department of Home Affairs in the Republic of South Africa for its continued faith in us. Our passport and consular services have been growing from strength to strength, and we look forward to bringing those best-in-class services to South African nationals here in the United Kingdom with the opening of these three new centres.” South Africans living in the United Kingdom will be able to visit the VFS Global centres to lodge applications and renew their South African passports. They will be delivering the following services; renewals of passport application processing for adults and passport application processing for minors. Applicants will get a dedicated courier service for processed passports, a dedicated email for applicant queries, quicker turnaround time for passport renewal, a passport photo service and an application tracking facility with SMS service.
