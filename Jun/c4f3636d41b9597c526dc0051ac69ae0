They said they didn’t take the presence of Covid-19 lightly. “We’ll continue to wash hands and wear masks until the end of the year,” said the church spokesman, Vusi Ndala, at their head office in Karenpark, north of Tshwane, on Friday, 24 June. This after government announced the scrapping off of the remaining Covid-19 regulations.
