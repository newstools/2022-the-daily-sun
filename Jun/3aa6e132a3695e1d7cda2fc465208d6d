A STREET in Zakheni Village near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga has a web of illegally connected water pipes underground. But now leaking water pipes have caused the street to be muddy and residents complain they cannot walk properly. Sello Mahlangu (43) said the street is no longer drivable and the leaking water pipes were the main cause of the problem. Sello told Daily Sun nobody cared about the condition of the street and the situation has been like that for more than a year now. “Everybody wants water and people connect their own pipes. Now there’s a leak that has damaged the street. We have to take a long direction when walking to the main road. Nobody wants to take responsibility of the situation and we don’t know whose pipe is leaking.” Another resident Sonto Msiza (39) said a lot of water was being wasted by the leaks. “Our municipality is facing a very big problem of water shortage. People complain when there’s no water but they waste it. The mud is stinking now and the problem needs to be fixed soon. A car cannot drive past the mud. When it rains, the street becomes worse. We are forced to lean on the fence when walking past the mud,” she said. Thembisile Hani Municipality spokeswoman Simphiwe Mokako said such situations needed to be reported by the councillor or ward committee. “As the municipality, we are trying by all means to fix water leakages because we are facing a shortage. Officials will be sent to assess the situation and see how it can be fixed,” she said.
