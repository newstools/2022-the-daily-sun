WITH just hours before the African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo holds its crucial elective conference, the province is still not certain how many delegates will be in attendance. Provincial secretary Soviet Lekganyane told Daily Sun the national dispute resolution committee was still busy with disputes lodged by branches across the province ahead of the conference scheduled to take place on Friday, 3 June. But he didn’t confirm if the conference will kick-off at The Ranch Hotel outside Polokwane as scheduled. “The national dispute resolution committee is still busy with disputes and we don’t know when they will finish,” he said. Peter Mokaba region chairman John Mpe said the region had done everything by the book and they were ready for the conference. He asked why the regional leadership was being questioned six months after they were elected. Lekganyane who is known to be a Ramaphosa ally is on the slate led by Limpopo public works MEC Dickson Masemola, who is up against his former ally Premier Stan Mathabatha for the chairmanship. Even though Mathabatha is leading a slate dominated by those known to be aligned with the Radical Economic Transformation, he has publicly endorsed Ramaphosa for a second term, a move that is said to have angered Lekganyane. Luthuli House has not confirmed yet whether Ramaphosa will open or close the conference as per tradition.
