GQEBERHA cops have arrested a 38-year-old man from Walmer, for allegedly killing his mother on Thursday, 23 June. According to Colonel Priscilla Naidu, it is alleged that at about 11am, police responded to a complaint of domestic violence at a house in Bhabhatane Street. And on arrival, they found the son leaving the premises. “He was instructed to open the locked door. The body of an elderly woman was found lying on the kitchen floor, with multiple stab wounds,” Naidu said in a statement. She added that the woman, who lived with her son, was identified as Ntombizana Frans (64). “He was arrested and detained on a charge of murder, and is expected to appear in the Gqeberha Magistrates Court on Monday, 27 June. It is alleged that there were constant fights at the house, but the mother never opened any case,” Naidu said. Acting Nelson Mandela Bay District commissioner Brigadier Thandiswa Kupiso has condemned the incident. “It is sad when a parent’s life is taken away in such a gruesome manner by their own child. The elderly are under great strain and as a society, we need to play our part in ensuring that they are safe,” Kupiso added.
