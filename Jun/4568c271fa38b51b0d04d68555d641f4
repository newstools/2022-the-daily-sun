DARING robbers got into the Zion Christian Church headquarters in Moria, Polokwane in April and made off with the money from the collection box. The suspects allegedly broke into the ZCC headquarters by cutting open the back fence and breaking the office windows. The church’s general secretary, Ephraim Mafetsa confirmed that the suspects made off with R6 000 worth of coins in a statement released by the church. The two suspects aged 35 and 61 were finally arrested and have appeared before the Mankweng Magistrate Court on Friday(10/6). The suspects will appear in court on 17 June. Mafetsa said the church’s Bishop Dr Edward Lekganyane thanked police for arresting the two perpetrators. He said Bishop Lekganyane encourages communities to cooperate with police in combating crime within their society. “We realised that only R6 000 worth of coins were stolen by the perpetrators from the finance department,” said the bishop. “Because of the high crime rate in South Africa, the Bishop encourages communities to cooperate with police in combating crime within our communities.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Mamphaswa Seabi said the case is being handled by the provincial task team. The incident has left residents in disbelief as they never thought thugs would steal at Moria. Thabo Lekgatla (33) said he believed that this was an inside job. “There is no way thugs can get in and rob Moria. The place is sacred. The people who stole the cash will regret it,” he said. Kamogelo Moetsi (40) told Daily Sun they can’t wait for the church to open its doors for everyone. “Maybe the thugs took advantage thinking it would be an easy job as many people were no longer going to Moria. But God will punish them for stealing from the poor,” she said.
