A 40-YEAR-OLD suspect was arrested by the Hawks on Tuesday, 21 June, in Markman, Gqeberha for allegations of attempted murder, murder and armed robbery. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Yolisa Mgolodela said on 19 March 2021, cops received information about a group of men travelling in two vehicles on the way to hijack and rob a courier vehicle transporting commercial goods. “The police spotted the vehicles in the Peddie area and gave chase. A shoot-out ensued between the suspects and the police while the suspects were fleeing in their vehicles. One suspect fell off the back of a Ford Ranger bakkie they were using and was declared dead,” Mgolodela said. She said another suspect was arrested on the spot, while another fled the scene. Mgolodela said the arrested suspect was expected to make his first court appearance in the Port Alfred Magistrates Court on 23 June.
