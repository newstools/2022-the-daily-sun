THE Mmabana Arts, Culture and Sports Foundation is under fire over a work of art. People across the country became enraged after a photo of a mural at the centre in Mafikeng, North West, went viral on Saturday, 4 June. The mural shows a man raping a woman next to another painting of the woman with tears on her face. Although the mural is intended to raise awareness about gender-based violence (GBV), many accused the centre of promoting pornography and said they were worried about kids seeing it. Facebook user Tshepo Mabe said he understood it was meant to raise awareness but he worried that kids would not know what they were seeing. “This is pornography and should not be on public platforms at all,” he said.

She said it could trigger people who had gone through trauma. “Some things are just not meant to be shown like this. “Find another way to deal with the matter. This is far from raising awareness,” she wrote. Agnes Rataemane said on Facebook that it made her feel as if perpetrators were getting more recognition than victims. “I really hope they’ll take it into consideration and have this removed. We’re already dealing with too much as a country,” she wrote. The foundation released a statement explaining the intentions behind the mural, saying it was part of a project to raise awareness around GBV. “Mmabana has noted the concerns and the outrage caused by this art work. “It appears that the intended message couldn’t be delivered. “After careful consideration, we have taken the decision to have it removed and it will be replaced,” the statement read. The foundation also apologised to the public for any harm that may have been caused.
