The South African Football Association (Safa) has dangled a R10 million carrot before Banyana Banyana to win the upcoming Africa Women's Cup of Nations set for Morocco on 2-23 July. Safa CEO Tebogo Motlanthe confirmed they have set aside the loot in what would be a historic bonus for the South African national teams. This would mean each Banyana player would walk away with a cool R400 000 should they defeat Nigeria, Burundi and Botswana, proceed to the knockout stages and ultimately win the elusive cup.

Safa has always been indicating that it will put more focus on women's football, and this could be the beginning of more bigger things for the future. "The R400 000 is a historic amount for all our national teams, it has never happened before," said Motlanthe on Tuesday following Banyana's training session in Joburg. "The 23 players have a lot to play for, including the bonuses. This we hope will motivate them to bring the trophy home." Banyana will depart for Morocco on Wednesday.
