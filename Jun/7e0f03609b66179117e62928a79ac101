THE Joburg District Police, in conjunction with various law enforcement agencies, confiscated fong-kong goods worth over R15 million on Wednesday, 15 June. Cops raided Pan Africa Mall and Joburg Mall at the corner of Jeppe and Troye street. Captain Xoli Mbele said they confiscated fabrics and consumer goods. “Pharmaceutical regulators confiscated large quantities of skin creams and other products that can only be obtained through a script. Suspects have violated the Medicine Related Substances Act 101 of 1965,” Mbele said in a statement. He added that five suspects, between the ages of 22 and 37, were arrested for possession and dealing in counterfeit goods. “Counterfeit goods have a negative impact on the economy of the country,” Mbele said.
