TWO suspects were arrested by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) for suspected human trafficking in Meredale, Joburg. JMPD spokesman Xolani Fihla said on Wednesday, 15 June, cops followed up on information of human trafficking in the area. And upon arrival, the complainant showed officers four Ethiopian teenage boys who had allegedly escaped from their traffickers. He added that the two alleged the boys were brought by their friend, and that he would be coming to fetch them later. Fihla said cops then interviewed the boys, who told them that the man had threatened to kill them if they tried to escape, and that they were being kept hostage against their will. "The two suspects were arrested and detained at Mondeor SAPS. Money amounting to R92 000 was also found in the apartment, and seized," said Fihla.
