VENDA could have four teams in the GladAfrica Championship next season. SunSport has reliably learnt that the ABC Motsepe outfit Munaca FC, who are based in Louis Trichardt, are negotiating with a GladAfrica Championship side to buy their status. Our mole said the Championship club managed to avoid relegation at the end of this season but have been struggling financially, and their boss has now put up the “for sale” sign on his club. So far, Championship teams that are from Venda are Black Leopards, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Venda Football Academy. “What you are talking about is just rumours,” said Munaca manager Michael Muzila. “From our side, we don’t know anything of such (a move). But if there is anything like that we will come back to you.” However, a source told SunSport that the deal is at an advanced stage. “If all goes well they can announce it before the end of this week,” said our source. “This negotiating has been going on since last week and everything has been going fine. We are just praying that the negotiations go well as this is not the first time these guys (Munaca) want to buy a Championship team.” Relegated TS Sporting were also reported to be keen to buy a Championship franchise and it has been reported they are also talking with the same club. If the Munaca deal goes through, Limpopo will boast eight professional teams – Tshakhuma, VFA, Baroka Polokwane City, Black Leopards (all Championship), and DStv Premiership sides, Sekhukhune United and Marumo Gallants.
