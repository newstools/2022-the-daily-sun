THE Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) wants to take advantage of the African National Congress’ loss of support to unseat the party in Gauteng in the 2024 election. Speaking at the EFF Freedom Charter commemoration event in Kliptown, Soweto, on Sunday 26 June, EFF Commander-in-Chief Julius Malema urged his party’s provincial leaders to seize the moment as the ANC was weak. “Fighters, if you miss this opportunity, you will never get it again. The ANC is at its weakest, especially in Gauteng and will never be this weak again,” Malema said. “They are at 50,1%, there is no miracle that will happen between now and 2024 to make the ANC gain more votes. Even if Mandela woke up, he will not get them anything above 50%. If you miss this opportunity, you will have only yourselves to blame.” He said the EFF will hold a provincial conference this year, and he wanted delegates to be disciplined. Despite having shown strong support for the Zondo Commission at the beginning, Malema dismissed its last report as “gossip”. He said Zondo loved being on TV. He said Zondo should be interdicted from holding press conferences and focus on serious cases. Speaking to a large group who had gathered in Kliptown, Malema said inequality existed for decades in South Africa. “When we said the people shall govern, we didn’t mean voting every five years only. We meant you must be represented in the SGBs and hospital boards. You must be represented in all organs of power where decisions are made. Be there and make those decisions.”
