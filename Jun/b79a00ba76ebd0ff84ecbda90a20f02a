following into consideration. 1  Advice the justice to release suspect of Babita
Deokaran no case against them. 2  Advice the president not to proceed with state
capture findings.” The letter further reads, “We not want you to be like Thabo
Masebe, Baita and Thabo Moerane… We know your visiting points. The plan is
complete. But only if you consider our proposal then the deal will be struck
off. The president listens to you than any other person…” President’s spokesman Vincent Magwena said, “The Presidency
has referred to security agencies a threat made against Director-General in the
Presidency Phindile Baleni. “Several days ago, Ms Baleni received a threat by an unknown

the findings of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State
Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector including Organs of State.” He said Baleni found, in her letter box at home, an envelope

by this threat against the Director-General,” he said.
