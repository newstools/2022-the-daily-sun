AN ANC councillor accused of raping his own daughter and abusing his power to escape the law will be prosecuted. This after the 39-year-old Bushbuckridge Municipality Ward 37 councillor briefly appeared in the Mhala Regional Court on Wednesday, 8 June. The matter was postponed to Monday, 13 June. The victim’s aunt (43) said they were satisfied with the court proceedings so far. “The girl started complaining last January that he had been raping her since she was 13. “We were disappointed when the matter was struck off the roll twice. We had to refer it to senior prosecutors in the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court and it was reinstated.” EFF MP Naledi Chirwa said they would support the victim’s family. “We ensured his stay in the municipal council is short-lived. We will always be on the side of the oppressed. “We recently stopped a council sitting, pushing that he must step aside from his duties until this case is finalised by a court of law,” she said. ANC’s Jabu Nwandzu and Ace Madike said they were disappointed by the councillor’s behaviour. Mpumalanga ANC spokeswoman Ngilozi Ndlovu, said: “Ehlanzeni region has already written a letter to the municipal speaker to inform her that the councillor should automatically step aside as he’s formally charged.” The councillor is out on a warning.
