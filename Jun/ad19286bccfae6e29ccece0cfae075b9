THABISILE Zikhali said she’s enjoying playing the role of a cop on SABC1’s Uzalo. She started appearing on the show in December and said she liked playing Constable Biyela, even though some people thought she was a real cop. Originally from KwaMashu near Durban and now living in Midrand, Joburg, Thabisile said that some people even saluted her in public. “I’m enjoying playing an officer and learning a lot. “My character shows the public that some cops do love their jobs. I’m proud that my character is not corrupt. “But people must know I’m not a cop in real life; I’m just acting.” Thabile (28) said she grew up watching Uzalo and always dreamed of becoming apart of it. “People will see new things about Biyela and she will show her qualities as a leader, she will be leading top cases soon.” ALSO READ: Skeem Saam actor and DJ go to war!
