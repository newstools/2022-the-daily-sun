A WOMAN is living in fear at a place of safety as her husband is tormenting her with death threats. The 40-year-old from Barberton, Mpumalanga, fled her abusive marital home but her husband would not leave her alone. The woman, who cannot be named, said her hubby followed her to her parents’ house and tried to burn down her room. The man continued hounding her even after she got a protection order and opened a case of arson against him. “I have been assaulted, called names and threatened,” she said. The mother of three said she decided to leave the abusive marriage in May after her husband insulted her and her sister. “I told myself I couldn’t allow the abuse to continue and decided to go to my family home. He came and burned down my room but fortunately, I was not inside,” she said. The woman said although she was at a place of safety, she was scared for her kids and her family. She alleged her stepson was also sending her threatening messages. She said he went to her parents’ house and fired four shots before threatening to kill her nephew. “My family doesn’t have freedom any more because of this man,” she said. “He hasn’t been arrested and him being on the streets compromises my family’s safety.” The victim’s sister said the whole family was scared. “This man is dangerous. He is a danger to himself and everyone. My sister cannot go to work and we are also not free,” she said. Commission for Gender Equality spokesman Javu Baloyi said: “We are hoping that the perpetrator will be arrested soon because he has allegedly been violating a protection order.” Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the suspects were being traced.
