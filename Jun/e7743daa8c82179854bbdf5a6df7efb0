The mansion, which is in a private suburban estate in Annlin, north of Pretoria, is owned by Vhuthanda Investment, whose sole director is the former NLC board chairman, Professor Alfred Ntshengedzeni Nevhutanda. SIU spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said: “The SIU probe has revealed that the property was funded by NPOs with the money they have received under the auspices of grant funding from National Lotteries Commission. At the time of the purchase, Prof Nevhutanda was chairman of the NLC board.” He said five NPOs applied for grant funding at NLC and were jointly funded to the tune of over R100 million. The property was purchased on 6 March 2018 and was registered in the name of Vhutanda Investments on 23 May 2018. “The more than R100 million in grant funding was purported to be for community empowerment projects like athletics tracks in North West and Mpumalanga, old age homes in North West and Limpopo and a rehabilitation centre in Soshanguve,” said Kganyago.
