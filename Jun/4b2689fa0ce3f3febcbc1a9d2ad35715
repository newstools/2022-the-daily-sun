THERE’S a new voice in politics – a political party aimed at restoring the dignity of Africans in the country. Bishop Marothi Mashashane, the leader of the African Amalgamated Restorative Movement (AARM), said they have come to the conclusion that as long as the African National Congress (ANC) is ruling, nothing is going to change for African people – especially the poor. “Poverty does not independently lead to lower quality of life but interacts with other factors that have an impact on quality of life,” he said. “There is a need to measure equality and add it to the relationship. For policy and service delivery, the findings mean that access to justice should not only be framed as a matter of means.” Mashashane said democracy didn’t mean anything if it didn’t protect and defend the vulnerable communities.

It is not true in real life that we are all equal before the law,” he said. “The ANC government has failed dismally to speak for the poor in the form of regulating the laws governing the justice system and financial services. The newly formed AARM aims to defend the rights of the vulnerable society. We are here to restore the dignity of the neglected.” Mashashane, who has been vocal about mandatory vaccination, said his movement was already receiving endorsement from several quarters including traditional leaders. Mashashane said the new party had its headquarters in Gauteng and forming a branch took 500 members. The party is yet to register with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC).
