STAGE six load shedding might be implemented this evening from 5pm if the situation doesn’t improve at Eskom. The leadership of the power utility has pleaded with its striking workers to put South Africans first. The current stage four load shedding has been attributed to the unprotected strike by workers at various Eskom power stations. Speaking during a virtual media briefing on Tuesday, 28 June, Eskom CEO Andre De Ruyter said: “I referred earlier to the unlawful industrial action that we are currently experiencing. This has unfortunately continued and has increased in intensity during the night. He said: “At Arnot, we have no bargaining unit employees available. We are running with our managerial staff and at Camden similarly, our control rooms are manned by managerial staff. There has been a blocking of the access road to Camden by the dumping of coal from a truck on to the access road.” De Ruyter said at Duvha Power Station, the plant is currently run by managerial staff as there are no controllers on site. PICS: A song fit for inkosi yamaZulu De Ruyter said at Hendrina, only 20% of workers are on shift and a vehicle has been torched with intimidation being quite severe. “We have seen peaceful protests at Kendal and Komati where we only have one unit operating as fine. “At Kusile, we have all employees on site. At Lethabo we have seen some pretty severe incidents of intimidation. Four homes of plant operators have been attacked with petrol bombs overnight.” To deal with the situation and also to find remedies for the situation, De Ruyter said he has engaged with the union leadership on Monday. “We have had a productive discussion. We are in the process of preparing for another meeting which will take place later this morning. Hence the very short notice for this meeting.” Stage 6 would
mean that South Africans will be faced with at least six hours of darkness per
day.
