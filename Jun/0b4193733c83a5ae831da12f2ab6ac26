MOSCOW, RUSSIA RUSSIA is increasing gas and oil supplies to Africa and the Middle East as it struggles to sell fuel in Europe. Refinitiv Eikon data showed that and sources said Asia is already taking bigger volumes of the Russian crude oil on offer. This development is likely to increase competition for Asian customers between Russia and other big fuel exporters – Saudi Arabia and the United States. – which are the top three suppliers to Asia. The European Union (EU) has slowly reduced imports of Russian crude and fuel since March.and agreed a full embargo that will take effect by end-2022. Asian buyers have stepped in to rapidly increase purchases of Russian crude, even though Asia is not a natural market for Russian fuel because Asia refines more oil than it needs and is a net fuel exporter. That makes finding new outlets such as Africa and the Middle East paramount for Russia to protect its global market share and avert a deeper decline in oil exports and output. “Africa and the Middle East seem to be the main options for Russian oil product suppliers. So, we expect more shipments there in the second half of the year as the EU embargo gets closer,” a trader, who is involved in Russian oil product trading, told Reuters. – REUTERS
