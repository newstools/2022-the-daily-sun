THE Esikhaleni Regional Court has sentenced a couple for armed robbery. According to Warrant Officer Bonisiwe Nxumalo, a businessman had a meeting with his former employee, Mamazane Maphumulo, at her place of residence in Esikhaleni on 28 January 2020. Nxumalo said the businessman was lured by Maphumulo to an incomplete building where he was forced to transfer R600 000 into Maphumulo’s bank account at gunpoint. “The victim was also robbed of his cellphone and left in that building. He reported the incident to the police where the case was transferred to the Richards Bay-based Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit for further handling. “Bank accounts were frozen and the accused could not access the money,” Nxumalo said. She said Maphumulo (32) and Dumisane Msomi (37) were arrested and charged with armed robbery. The duo made several court appearances until they were sentenced on 9 June “Msomi was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment while Maphumulo was sentenced to 12 years,” said Nxumalo.
