SELF-CONFESSED former occultist Jay Israel Senior said he was once given the option to sleep with a dead woman for power, fame and fortune. He recently released a series of videos on Facebook, in which he spoke about his experience with evil magic. He claimed he was married to a jealous mermaid for six years. In one video, he said: “I said I wanted power, riches and fame. All three things I got.” He was then told he had three ways to do this – the first was to sleep with a married woman and collect samples from her to perform a ritual. The second was to sleep with a dead person and wipe the body with a towel, which he had to take to evil people. “They said if I am unable to do these, I will have a third one – to introduce me to a woman I was going to marry.” Israel said he agreed to marry a mermaid, who came to him once a year to sleep with him in his dreams. He was allowed to sleep with other women – as long as he was not committed to them. “If you fell in love or married any of them, they would die because the woman you were married to was very jealous.” He said the mermaid had to be given a horn and be fed blood. Israel used to lead a big church in the Eastern Cape, and said he was first recruited into a cult in a village in Ghana. Apostle Ramabulana Makhado, who also recently confessed, said he was initiated in Congo River by a creature that was half human and half crocodile. The pastors testified to the CRL Rights Commission in 2020. Commission spokesman Mpiyakhe Mkholo told Daily Sun that issue was still being investigated.
