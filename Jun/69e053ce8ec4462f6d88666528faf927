SCHOOLS are supposed to the safest
place for children when they are not home. But that seem not to be the case in
one of the Tabankulu schools in the Eastern Cape. A principal (59) of a local school in
that area was arrested on Friday 10 June following an outcry by school
children, the community and other stakeholders after a 21-year-old school child
was allegedly raped by an elderly in the school. Police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi
Kinana said in a statement, “According to the report the incident occurred on
different occasions but was not immediately reported to the SAPS until school
children protested against the school authorities. The circumstances
surrounding the incident are currently under investigation by the FCS unit. READ: Rape-accused councillor in court He added, “A case of rape was

must now have his day in court in order to account for his actions." said Mene. Anyone who can assist in the
