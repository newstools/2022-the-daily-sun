ACTRESS Thuthuka Mthembu has managed to win the hearts of Mzansi TV viewers. Judging from the comments she often receives after posting photos on social media, the Uzalo star is one of Mzansi’s favourite stars. But as much as fans love her, she has made it clear that there should be a limit or rules on how they celebrate her. Thuthuka, who plays Nonkanyiso on the soapie, said some fans went as far as kissing her on the mouth, which made her uncomfortable. “I love my fans deeply. But sometimes they put me in an uncomfortable position. There are different incidents where some of them go as far as kissing me on the mouth. For me, this is not right,” said Thuthuka. The actress added that she did not reprimand her fans whenever they kissed her because she was afraid they would be disappointed. ALSO READ: Muvhango fires 2 top actors! “Being celebrated is hard. And people are sensitive towards celebrities. It is easy for them to judge us. To them, it’s like we are living in another planet. Imagine telling an excited person to stop what they are doing? That would be interpreted as rude or arrogant. That’s what I sometimes go through. I have to smile and pretend that everything is fine, whereas it’s the opposite.” Thuthuka said a hug was fine, but a kiss was a big no-no. “I think fans must be taught how to treat celebrities. I don’t know who should teach them. But they must know that celebrities have rules and feelings as well. I know that without my fans, I’m nothing. I regard them as my bosses. But they must know that we must treat each other in a respectful way,” she added.
