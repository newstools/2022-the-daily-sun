HEALTH Minister Dr Joe Phaahla has confirmed Mzansi’s first monkeypox case. He said the 30-year-old man had no travel history. Briefing the media, Phaahla said the current outbreak is dominated by high numbers in Europe, UK, Spain, Germany, Portugal and France and cases have also been reported in the United States and Canada. Phaahla said the National Institute of Communicable diseases (NICD) was busy with contact tracing. The NICD said: “A case of monkeypox has been identified in South Africa. The case involves a 30-year-old male residing in the Gauteng province. Monkeypox is rarely fatal. Severe cases may occur in children, pregnant women and in individuals that are immunocompromised.” “Monkeypox is a rare viral infection in humans. Since May 2022, monkeypox has been reported in more than 3 000 individuals from several European countries, the USA, Canada, Australia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. This is the first multi-country outbreak of monkeypox and is already the largest outbreak of monkeypox recorded. The NICD said risk factors include reporting multiple sexual partners. “Recent large social events are thought to have served as super spreader events,” the NICD said.
