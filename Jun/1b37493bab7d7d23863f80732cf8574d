THE Table Mountain Aerial Cableway (TMAC) is shutting down for the next five weeks. The cableway is a cable car transportation system offering visitors a five-minute ride to the top of Table Mountain in Cape Town. In a statement released on Sunday, TMAC said it’ll shut down for its annual maintenance shutdown from 2 July 2022 till 28 August 2022. “Shutdowns are needed to ensure the best and safest cableway experience for all our visitors. “Upper and lower station rides will all be closed as well as every cabin,” the company said. TMAC is one of Mzansi’s most popular tourist attractions with approximately one million people a year using the cableway. “For more than 80 years the Table Mountain Cableway has allowed the mountain’s biggest fans to ascend her jagged cliffs and feast their eyes on the views from above,” the statement read. Bearing sad news to its customers, the company also revealed that it has been nominated for two travel awards this year.
