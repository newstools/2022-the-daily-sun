DELFT residents in Cape Town were left shocked by the murder of a policewoman on Tuesday, 21 June. The cop, who was relaxing with her friends in front of her house in Gilo Street, was attacked by three assailants. A resident who lives nearby, Nomathamsanqa Gadala (45), told Daily Sun she heard gunshots and ran inside her house. “I thought it was a gang war because it is common around here but I was shocked when I heard that a woman was shot. “When I went to the scene I was told it was a cop, who we always see going to work in her uniform. We are in shock because she was a young cop who loved laughing with kids when she walked in the street in her uniform,” she said. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Novella Potelwa confirmed the incident and said cops are still trying to get more information about the incident. “A 26-year-old off-duty police official was shot and killed in Delft on Tuesday evening. Details about the shooting incident are still sketchy. Eyewitness accounts from the crime scene indicate that the police constable attached to Table Bay Harbour Police Station was standing in front of her residence with three other people when unknown gunmen emerged and fired several shots,” said Potelwa. She said a murder docket was opened for investigation at Delft cop shop. She said detectives from the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) have taken over the investigation. “No arrests have been effected yet. Her identity will be released once her next of kin has been informed,” said Potelwa. This is the second cop to be murdered in Cape Town this month. Siyakubonga Mphakathi (49) was shot and killed while he was on his way to work in Philippi. He was buried last week. Last month, another cop was shot and killed by a patient at New Somerset Hospital in Cape Town.
