WHEN Johannes Mothemane (52) lost his job selling fruit at a nursery in 2004, he had to make a plan to make a living. Because Johannes loves farming, he decided to open his own stall along the D3332 road near his home in Ga-Mabitsela Village, Moletjie outside Polokwane in 2006. He sold fruit and vegetables but because of a shortage of water, the produce would die. Johannes told Daily Sun he had to fetch water with a wheelbarrow but that was very tiring. “I had to think on my feet. I love avocados so in 2010 I started growing them,” he said. “Avos only require a lot of water when they blossom in June and July.” Johannes now owns 27 trees and supplies his avos to local markets. He plans to have 50 trees and supply bigger markets. “I’m the only one who grows avos in my village which gives me an advantage,” he said. His biggest challenge is getting clean running water for his trees. “Getting water would solve all my problems. “I can’t harvest enough avos to be able to supply local and bigger supermarkets,” he said. “I was supplying local supermarkets but had to stop as I couldn’t harvest enough avocados and I couldn’t make a profit.” He said he was optimistic that things will soon fall into place. Agriculture spokesman Joshua Kwapa said Johannes must register as a crop farmer at any local agricultural office. “Officials will visit his farm. “As a registered farmer, he will be able to apply for assistance through various programmes such as Letsema, Fetsa Tlala and other farmer support programmes,” Kwapa told the People’s Paper.
