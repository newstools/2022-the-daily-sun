A MPUMALANGA family is crying foul after their son was found hanging in the bushes on Thursday, 16 June. Shadrack Shongwe from Nkomazi, Mpumalanga was admitted to Shongwe Hospital on Tuesday, 14 June. But the 21-year-old was found dead the day after being admitted to hospital. His uncle Mishack Shongwe (34) said the family received a call on Wednesday, 15 June informing them of his disappearance. They received another call on Thursday, 16 June to inform them their son had escaped and had committed suicide a few kilometres away from the hospital. Shadrack apparently used a wire to kill himself and was found wearing hospital clothes. But Mishack said the family doesn’t believe the hospital, and they think their son was killed somewhere else before he was hung. He said they were not sure whether his death was suicide or murder, and were demanding answers from the hospital. “Looking at the distance from the place where he allegedly killed himself and the hospital, raises a lot of questions. “We don’t believe he killed himself, but that he was killed.

Mishack said they wanted to know what really happened to their loved one. “How did the security at the gate allow him to pass while he was still in his hospital clothes? It doesn’t make sense.” Last month, a patient admitted to the same hospital for observation with a diagnosis of acute psychosis was found hanging in the toilet. He allegedly used a stockinette bandage to hang himself. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said police have opened an inquest docket. Meanwhile, Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said they were busy with investigations but didn’t have much details at this point. “We are still waiting for a report from the hospital,” said Malamule.
