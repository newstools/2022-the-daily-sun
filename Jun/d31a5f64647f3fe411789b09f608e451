THE Namibian Ombudsman won’t be instituting investigations against President Hage Geingob. He was implicated in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala farm scandal. Last week, Namibian Economic Freedom Fighters lodged a complaint following allegations made by former spy boss Arthur Fraser. In his affidavit, Fraser said Ramaphosa sought assistance from Geingob to illegally extradite a suspect who stole from his farm. The Ombudsman’s advocate Basilius Dyakugha on Tuesday, 14 June, said the complaint was that of a criminal nature, which is outside of his office’s jurisdiction. “I therefore decline to investigate the complaint submitted by the Namibian Economic Freedom Fighters.” He said that the mandate of the Ombudsman was within the borders of Namibia. “I have to investigate citizens of Namibia. The complaint should not even have focused on the head of state. “It should have focused on the operations of administrative issues, which fall under my mandate.” Dyakugha said his office could still look into the matter but that it would depend on how they were going to take his referral. He also said the Ombudsman should be the last resort, and encourage them to first approach relevant institutions. This was not received well by the Namibian EFF, that alleged there were high powers who instructed the Ombudsman not to investigate. Deputy president Kalimbo Iipumbu said: “Studying the complaint, we still think you did not respond independently as is the main purpose of your office.” Iipumbu said the idea was to see to it what had transpired until suspects were arrested. He said denying that the Ombudsman could not investigate meant there was an instruction from the highest authority. He said the office should have come up with a report that said Geingob did not conspire with Ramaphosa. “This simply means we don’t need the office in Namibia,” he said, adding that the Ombudsman would just be a waste of time.
