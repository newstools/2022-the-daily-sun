TWO women and a man, who were arrested by cops for medical fraud, appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Tuesday, 21 June. Calcutta police pounced on them in Mkhuhlu on Monday, 20 June, and charged them with fraud. They were not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before Magistrate Ayesha Kikia. The state prosecutor, Zanele Makukule, said the offence that the suspects allegedly committed is very serious and they might get a hefty sentence if found guilty. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed the suspects’ arrest by Calcutta police for allegedly forging medical reports. Mpumalanga National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said: “On the date in question, these three people were still initiating the whole application for Sassa grants. “They fraudulently obtained medical records on the date they presented them to a doctor, so that he could sign them off and show that they are people with disabilities, therefore making them eligible for the grants. The applications were for their own benefit.” The suspects were released on R1 000 bail each. They will appear again in court on 11 July.
