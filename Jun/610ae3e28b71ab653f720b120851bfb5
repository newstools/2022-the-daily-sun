UKHOZI FM’s
popular DJ Sipho “DJ Sgqemeza” Mbatha is finally back on air. This after
speculations about his on-air return following his suspension. Sgqemeza
was suspended by the SABC for a month on 18 May after he allegedly played a
song from a cellphone that was not on the station’s playlist. A few days ago,
when he was expected to be back on air, he caused panic when he posted on his
Facebook page: “Big decision to make before Monday the 20th, not my will but
thine will be done.” Many
listeners interpreted this as a decision to leave the station after a month of
suspension. DJ Sgqemeza
thanked his co-host Nonhlanhla “Mroza” Buthelezi for showing him love during
his first day back from his month-long suspension. “I’m told
Mroza was not going to be on air today because she is writing her exams but she
came to welcome me back. I thanked her for the big love. ALSO READ |

Sgqemeza, who is the presenter of the Monday to Friday’s 6am to 9am Vuka Africa

and content producer Babheke Mthethwa but they were back at work after a week. Listeners
to the station were excited that Sgqemeza decided to come back to the station. Ukhozi FM
listener Phumzile Nyide said they were happy that he is finally back at work. “We were
worried that he had taken the big decision to leave Ukhozi and go somewhere
else after the suspension. We love him,” she said. Daily Sun
contacted Sgqemeza but he did not answer his cellphone at the time of going to
print.
