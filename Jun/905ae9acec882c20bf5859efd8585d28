A priest who asked not to be named told Daily Sun iconoclasm has happened in the past, especially in Europe, which is the destruction of statues and it can be the result of hate for the Catholic church. He said alot of people are still reeling in shock over people being killed in Nigeria during mass. “The new form of iconoclasm is not to break statues but to break people into pieces with bullets and so forth,” said the priest. He said the person who did this was all alone and he had a Bible. He added that he was grateful no one was injured in this incident. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo confirmed the incident, saying that the man was arrested and charged with malicious damage to property.
