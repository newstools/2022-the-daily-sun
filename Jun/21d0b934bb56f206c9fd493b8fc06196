CAPE Town All Stars came from behind to stun Swallows FC 2-1 in the promotion/ relegation match at Danie Craves Stadium on Saturday afternoon. All Stars went to the match with nothing to play for as their dream of playing in the DStv Premiership next season went up to smoke on Wednesday when they drew 1-1 with the University of Pretoria. However, that did not stop them from producing one of their best performances in the relegation/ promotion play-offs to beat Swallows. The Dube Birds were the first to find the back of the net in the 62nd minute when Grant Margeman collected a pass from Wambi before rifling a left-footed strike into the bottom corner from distance. Swallows had a couple of chances to wrap up the match but All Stars goalkeeper Kyle Peters produced some great saves to keep his side in the match. The home side continued fighting and were rewarded in the 88th minute when Ronaldo Maarman pulled an equaliser. It looked like the match will end in a draw until the 92nd minute when All Stars were awarded a penalty after Wandisile Letlabika handled the ball in the box. Ndiviwe Mdabuka stepped up and calmly converted to hand All Stars victory which will see them finish at the bottom of the three team mini-league with four points from three outings. The loss sees Swallows remain behind AmaTuks on the playoff log, with just four points and they now need to beat Tuks on Wednesday in their final playoff final encounter to save their lucrative elite league status. A defeat or draw at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday (3pm) for Swallows will see AmaTuks winning promotion and taking the last spot in the DStv Premiership and Swallows will go down to the GladAfrica Championship.
