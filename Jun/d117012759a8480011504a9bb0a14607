MPUMALANGA police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela, has warned residents to be careful during the winter period to prevent the loss of life. Her stern warning comes after a two-year-old boy died after he accidentally burnt himself in Daggakraal, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday, 15 June. Low temperatures and load shedding experienced throughout the country drive members of the public to seek alternative ways to warm themselves. However, these methods are not always safe. “During the winter season, accidental deaths due to fire and other causes are sadly experienced where most of the victims are unfortunately children. As temperatures drop, people resort to various options to warm themselves. At times, some of the practices are hazardous, more especially when used by children without adult supervision. “This could be a recipe for disaster, resulting in fatal accidents. For instance, on 15 June, a two-year-old boy became a victim of such incidents at Daggakraal. “It is alleged that on that fateful day, the child pulled a kettle with hot water inside. He was taken to a local clinic thereafter and later transferred to Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela where he unfortunately succumbed to his injuries. An inquest case was opened,” Manamela said. She urged members of the public to take precautions when using appliances such as gas stoves, paraffin stoves, heaters, home-made fires or imbawula in an effort to get warm during this cold season. “It is on each parent’s shoulder to be vigilant, more so that the children are on school holidays. We plead with parents, as well as guardians, to look after their kids, including those children who are visiting. “Adults need to care for the young ones. Let us also make sure that they play in safe places and avoid playing near pools, holes, open drains or next to the roads,” she said.
