IVY Madyo, the owner of Lutifusion Productions, said the National Arts Festival in Makhanda is not for school-going children. The festival has been running from 23 June and will end on 3 July. He said: “It has come to our attention that one of the banners put up for advertising purposes had an error that advertised the closing music festival as a school festival. “The purpose of the festival has always been to celebrate the closing of the National Arts Festival in Makhanda and entertain adults – not underage children.” Ivy said the festival had nothing to do with schools and assured patrons that no children would be in attendance. “As a company that is supported by its community, we pride ourselves in giving back to our community. This is evidenced by our continued philanthropic work through working with schools. We condemn any underage drinking and would never be party to such insensitive and immoral behaviour.”
