THE firestorm of the Cyril Ramaphosa scandal has spread to neighbouring Namibia. The country’s EFF has called for its President Hage Geingob to be investigated for allegedly teaming up with his Mzansi counterpart, Ramaphosa, in concealing the crime that was said to have taken place at his farm in Limpopo. During a media briefing in Windhoek, EFF’s Namibia deputy president Kalimbo Iipumbu said the party was concerned that Ramaphosa unleashed his thugs to track down suspects in their country with Geingob’s aid. “The president of Namibia must be investigated for conspiring with Ramaphosa to kidnap Namibians and assisting Ramaphosa in concealing his money laundering crimes,” said Iipumbu. He said the Namibian EFF party had lodged a formal complaint against Geingob with the office of the ombudsman regarding the reported cover-up of an alleged theft of at least $4 million (about R61 million) in South Africa.

Iipumbu said Fraser recently revealed that two heads of state had worked together in concealing the crimes of theft, money laundering and bribery that had taken place in the country in 2020. “If the report from the ombudsman shows that the president is involved, we expect the authority to arrest him. The president must be arrested,” Iipumbu said. Although calls for Ramaphosa to step down continue to mount, his deputy David Mabuza came to his defence. He said the calls for Ramaphosa to step down were premature.
