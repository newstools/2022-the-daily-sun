HIS family moved to KZN many years ago and he claims they left him behind because of his addiction. Qiniso Mbuyase has now turned an old bus stop in Bolata Village in QwaQwa, Free State, into his home as he had nowhere to go. The 25-year-old nyaope addict told Daily Sun his parents, who are still alive, left him behind in 2018. He admitted that he gave his family a hard time and said he wished they would forgive him. “I would love to be reunited with my family and ask them to organise rehab for me. I’m willing to quit nyaope,” he said. Qiniso said he wanted to change his life. “My childhood dream was to be a radio presenter. It’s my wish to further my studies in media and broadcasting so that I will be a good example to all nyaope addicts,” he said. Qiniso also pleaded with residents to give him a place to stay. “I have learnt my lesson that I need to respect my parents. I wish I could turn back the clock and be a good child who listens to his parents,” he said. He said that he survived by doing odd jobs for residents like fetching water and cleaning yards. Despite the extremely cold weather in QwaQwa, Qiniso’s been seen sleeping naked and he covered his body with plastic and used pieces of tents. He was first found by community patrollers, who thought he was a criminal. Community leader Mantseka Mofokeng (39), said they asked Qiniso many questions to understand why he was living at the bus stop. “His parents and siblings lived in the area. Unfortunately we don’t have their contacts details. We decided to contribute money to buy him food and winter clothes as we saw him sleep naked. We are searching for an alternative place for him while the police are helping us find his family,” said Mantseka.
