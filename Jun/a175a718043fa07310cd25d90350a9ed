Mzansi
power utility Eskom has announced that it will be implementing Stage 2 load shedding
from 17:00 and 22:00 tonight and every evening until Thursday, 23 June. “Eskom regrets
to announce the implementation of Stage 2 load shedding starting at 17:00 —
22:00 this evening. Due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, load shedding
will be implemented every evening at the same time until Thursday night,” Eskom
said in statement. It further
said it will continue to closely monitor the system, adjust and communicate any
changes as may be necessary.  

 The power
utility then appealed to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the
shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off
all non-essential items.
