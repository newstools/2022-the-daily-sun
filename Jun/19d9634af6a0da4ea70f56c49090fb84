FORMER Correctional Services commissioner Arthur Fraser laid
criminal charges against President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday, 1 June. And Vincent Magwenya, the president’s newly-appointed
spokesman, said the Presidency could confirm that a robbery took place at
Ramaphosa’s farm in Limpopo on 9 February 2020, in which profits from the sale
of game were stolen. Magwenya said Ramaphosa was attending an African Union
Summit in Addis Ababa at the time. “On being advised of the robbery, Ramaphosa reported the
incident to the head of the Presidential Protection Unit of the South African
Police Service for investigation,” he said. According to Magwenya, Ramaphosa was standing ready to
co-operate with any law enforcement investigation of these matters. “Ramaphosa remains resolute in leading the fight against corruption,
restoring the integrity and capability of public institutions as well as
overcoming the legacy of state capture, and will not be deterred by
disinformation campaigns,” he said.
