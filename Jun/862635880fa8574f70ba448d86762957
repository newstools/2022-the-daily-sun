FORMER SAPS supply chain manager Heine Barnard and former State Security Agency chief financial officer Solomon Lazarus’ application for corruption charges against them to be withdrawn has been dismissed. The two appeared in the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane on Monday, 20 June alongside former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli on charges of corruption, fraud and theft. The crimes they are accused of were allegedly committed between 2008 and 2012 when they were in charge of police crime intelligence services. They allegedly abused the secret service account. Barnard and Lazarus told the court their case was harmed by Mdluli’s constant delays. They said after 22 months, they were appearing for the 16th time and the case was going nowhere. The state told the court it had been bending over backward to get Mdluli to court and even executed a warrant of arrest when he failed to appear on 12 March 2021. State Prosecutor Arno Rossouw said the state only heard of Mdluli’s review application in February and it was only filed in May. He said the application had no chance of success. “This court cannot be held to ransom for another five years. “We don’t know when this review application will be heard. This matter has been in court already for 11 years,” said Rossouw. The state said the court must order that the trial continues irrespective of the review application or the case will hang in the air. Advocate Ike Motloung, representing Mdluli, said his client’s review application to his former employer, the SAPS, which denied him legal funding, was in full swing. The court postponed the matter to 20 September for a pretrial conference.
