LIMPOPO cops have arrested a man in connection with the murder of a teacher. Police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe said the 34-year-old allegedly murdered 27-year-old Dudu Masango at Dindela Village on Saturday, 11 June. The victim had laid a charge of rape against her ex-boyfriend last month, and he was bust. He was then released on R500 bail. The victim was found dead with multiple stab wounds in the bedroom of her house on Sunday, 12 June. Sexual assault could not be ruled out, and Masango’s car was found abandoned at Suiwerfontein fields. The station commander, together with the local task team comprising detective commander, visible policing commander and detectives on standby, conducted an operation and apprehended the suspect. He was allegedly found in possession of Masango’s cellphone and car keys. Hadebe said: “We shall stop at nothing to ensure that justice is not only done, but must be seen to be done.” The suspect, facing charges of murder and house robbery, will appear in the Nebo Magistrates Court soon.
