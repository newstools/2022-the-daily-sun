THE South African Football Association (Safa) has welcomed government’s decision to repeal limitations on public events gatherings, allowing capacity crowds at sports stadiums. Safa Chief Medical Officer Doctor Thulani Ngwenya welcomed the decision, taken after a meeting of the National Coronavirus Command Council, and said South African football now has an opportunity to rebuild the stadium economy that was decimated by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are back to normal,” said Ngwenya after government also repealed the rules of wearing of masks in public places. “The sector has been severely affected by the pandemic and it is now time to begin the fight for recovery from an economic point of view. It is a great opportunity to recover the economy. “But I must add that we still need to be cautious, review our protocols on stadium safety. This is the time for us to review those protocols.” Doctor Ngwenya expanded further and said the change do not mean that vaccination must stop. “The country has almost reached herd immunity because more than 50 percent of the country’s population has been vaccinated, and more 70 percent of the elderly population has been fully vaccinated. However this doesn’t mean that we have to stop with vaccination. We still need to continue with vaccination so that we minimize the risk of severe illness”
