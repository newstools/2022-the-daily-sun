BRANDON Qhanga said he feels like his house is a public toilet. The 35-year-old from Dubai informal settlement, near Mfuleni in Cape Town, said people relieved themselves in an open space next to his shack. The area, which was occupied in 2020, does not have toilets. Brandon said sometimes he was woken up by the smell of kak when someone relieved themselves outside. “I sometimes shout at them to go and kak somewhere else but the problem is there are no toilets and they find this open space convenient,” he said. When the SunTeam visited the area, Brandon warned them to be careful where they stepped as there was kak everywhere. Community leader Thando Mcuntula said the municipality refused to provide them with services. “They are refusing to recognise our kasi, hence we do not have basic services,” he said. Human settlements MMC Malusi Booi said the settlement was in the Driftsands Nature Reserve and residents were asked to leave. “Assessments of all recently and unlawfully occupied areas are undertaken and will continue to be undertaken  across the metro,” he said. “The majority of the settlements have been established on unsuitable land, in waterlogged areas like wetlands, road reserves and nature reserve. “The city advises residents that unlawful occupation comes with great health and safety risks.” MMC for water and sanitation, Zahid Badroodien, said the city could not provide services as the settlement was in a nature reserve. Badroodien said the city did not support land invasions. “The services that the city renders are in line with the Constitution and are delivered within a limited budget,” he said.
