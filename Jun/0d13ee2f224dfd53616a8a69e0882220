KHAYALETHU Magadla is in the hearts and prayers of Soweto residents. The young champ has been missing since 12 June, after falling into a manhole while playing with friends. The Emergency Medical Service team has been looking for him without any success and they have handed over the search to Joburg Water. Later today, the residents of Dlamini will host a candlelight prayer to bring strength to the family. They described the six-year-old as a loving and respectful child. Resident Prudence Sithole told Daily Sun that even though the search was unsuccessful, the community hopes that God will eventually lead them in the right direction of finding Khayalethu. “It’s really sad to think about how young this boy was. He had his future ahead of him and we’re all heartbroken. We can’t even begin to imagine what the family is going through,” said Londiwe Mathe. Lungisani Michaels said he’s been praying for the family and he’s looking forward to the candlelight prayer service. “Right now, it might seem as if all hope is lost but we need to trust in God to help guide us in the right direction,” he said. Mathapelo Motseki is sending love and light to the Magadla family and encourages them not to lose hope. “I can’t imagine how devastated they are right now. No parent or child should ever go through this but we’ll pray and search till we find this boy,” said Mathapelo.
