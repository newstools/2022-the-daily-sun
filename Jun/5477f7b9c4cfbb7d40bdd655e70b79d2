THE brutal murder of Sinah Sefora has left her family members in deep pain. The 29-year-old’s body was found by the bushes near her home on Saturday, 28 May, in Lekgalong village outside Rustenburg, North West. Family spokesman Petrus Shimamlalazi said the incident had left them shocked and heartbroken. “I was called when people saw her by the bushes near home. Her face was damaged. We hope justice will take its course. The perpetrator must rot in jail,” he said. He added that more women would be killed if the perpetrator continued living within their community. Sinah’s mother Mapula Sefora said she was struggling to come to terms with her tragic murder. “I am not coping,” she said. Sinah will be laid to rest on Saturday, 4 June. Meanwhile, a woman was attacked and stabbed on Thursday, 2 June, in the same village. Dieketseng Motlhabi was hospitalised after surviving stab wounds, and said she was still processing what had happened to her. Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the police were aware of the two incidents. Mokgwabone said cases of murder and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm were being investigated, and no arrests had yet been made.
