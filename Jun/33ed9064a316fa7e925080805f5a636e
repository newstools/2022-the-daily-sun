THE family of a shooting victim, Vathiswa Langa, desperately needs help to bury her. The 23-year-old up-and-coming musician was shot in the head in Gugulethu, Cape Town on Sunday, 5 June. It’s believed the gunmen were aiming for a man sitting in a car next to Vathiswa and her friends. Her mum, Nokwanda (67), told Daily Sun: “We would like to bury her with dignity and we ask anyone who can help us to come forward. “She died a painful death and all we want is to give her a decent burial.” Vathiswa’s aunt, Boniswa (61), said her niece wanted to go to Durban to pursue a music career. “She had a lot of ambition and wanted to become a well-known singer. She was walking in that direction. “She even appeared in Prince Kaybee’s Gugulethu video. She followed everything related to music,” she said. The family said in order to give Vathiswa a decent funeral, they would need R32 000. Although they’ve managed to collect some money, they said they needed more help. The shooting incident claimed two other lives and left two people hurt. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said: “Police are investigating the murder of three people and attempted murder of two in Gugulethu on Sunday, 5 June. “Initial reports indicate that at about 8pm, unidentified occupants of a white Toyota Corolla opened fire at a group of five.” Cops said no arrests have been made yet and asked anyone with information to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
