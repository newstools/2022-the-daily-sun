FOUR suspects unexpectedly stormed into a house. They pointed a gun at a man and told him they were paid R20 000 to kill him as he was having an affair with a woman in KwaThema in Ekurhuleni. But the izinkabi changed their minds and instead of killing him, they took things from the house, loaded them in a silver grey VW Polo, belonging to the man’s wife and left. This happened on Monday, 27 June. The car was later found in Daveyton by a tracker. The traumatised couple from Springs were left tied up and later released by neighbours. The 37-year-old husband said they had just returned from Everest squatter camp when the incident happened. He told the cops how they were attacked. He said: “I unlocked the gate, parked the bakkie and walked towards the kitchen door with my wife. “We were about to get inside the house when four armed men pushed us in,” he said. He said they pointed guns at them. “They tied us with wires and assaulted me. One of them said they have been sent to kill me as I’m having an affair with a lady in KwaThema. I was shocked because I’m not involved with any woman in KwaThema,” he said. But the men didn’t kill him. Instead, they ransacked the house. They took clothes, shoes, groceries, three TVs, a microwave, home theatre, alcohol and R9 000 in cash. Sergeant Themba Tshabalala of Springs police said no shots were fired and the husband sustained minor wounds on both hands while his wife was unharmed. A case of house robbery was opened at Springs Police Station. Anyone with information on the incident can contact 08600 10111 or Springs Police Station on 011 365 5700.
