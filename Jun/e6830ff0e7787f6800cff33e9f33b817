THE final State Capture report will be submitted to
President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday 20 June 2022. The report was initially supposed to have been released on
Wednesday, however that didn’t happen due to ‘challenges.’ The Commission’s spokeswoman Professor Itumeleng Mosala said
in a statement, “The Commission wishes to announce to the members of the media
and the public that it was not able to submit the final volumes of its Report
to the President on 15 June 2022 due to certain challenges. “The electronic Report will, however, now be certainly,
submitted to the President during the evening tomorrow, 19th June 2022. The
handover ceremony will take place on Monday 20th June 2022 at the Union
Buildings in Pretoria at 18h00.”
