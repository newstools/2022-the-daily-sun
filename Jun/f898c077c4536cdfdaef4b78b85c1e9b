DAY care centres in Makapanstad, North West took a stand against child abuse in their area on Monday, 13 June. To close off their child protection campaign, the centres held an event where the kids and their teachers marched around the area and did some activities to raise awareness on child abuse. Kenyaditswe Susan Moabi (63), founder of Botsanang Day Care Centre, said she started the awareness campaign as she saw a need that needed to be addressed in their kasi and centres. She said children are being abused sexually, physically and emotionally and they don’t know where to report the abuse.

Rebecca Letebele (47), chairwoman of Moretele ECD Forum, said they also went to social workers’ offices to show the kids that they can report any sort of abuse there. She said they also visited the police station. “The reason we did this road show was that our children need to know there are places safe for them when they feel abused.” Moretele Municipality’s social services manager, Maggy Selomo-Lebedike, said she was proud to see the steps being taken by day care centres to raise awareness against child abuse. “We hope such a movement will show people that children have rights and they need to be protected,” she said.
