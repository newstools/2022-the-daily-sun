TWO women appeared in the Rustenburg Magistrates Court facing theft charges worth more than R10 million. This after they were arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit on Friday and Monday, respectively. Police spokesman Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said the duo was employed by Sitona Mining when they allegedly stole from the company. “It’s alleged that between 2014 and 2019, one of the employees transferred more than R9,3 million into two of her personal accounts and allegedly concealed and disguised the source of the money,” Rikhotso said. She now faces 126 counts of theft and one count of contravention of Section 4(b)(i), read with section 1 and 8 of Act 121 of 1998 of Prevention of Organise Crime Act (POCA). The second employee also allegedly used the same modus operandi and transferred more than R1 million into her account during the same period. She faces 18 counts of theft and 21 counts of contravention of Section 4(b)(i) of Act 121 of 1998 of POCA. They were granted bail of between R15 000 and R30 000, and the matter was postponed to 8 July for the case to be transferred to the regional court.
