COPS arrested a 40-year-old shop owner in Clayville extension 71, near Midrand, on Monday, 27 June, following a mob attack. According to Captain Ben Matimulane, preliminary investigations led the police to link the shop owner to a mob attack incident that took place on Saturday, 25 June. Matimulane said it is alleged that the victim and his friend attempted to rob the suspect in his shop. “The suspect and his shop assistant locked the victim and his friend inside the shop where community members later allegedly assaulted the duo. “One of the suspected robbers managed to escape, while the other was left for dead in an open veld,” Matimulane said in a statement. He said the victim succumbed to his injuries in a hospital on Tuesday, 28 June. The suspect will appear in court once charged. Meanwhile, the station commander of Ivory Park cop shop, Brigadier Mbongeni Ngcobo, has warned the community to avoid taking the law into their own hands. Ngcobo said community members should continue to work with the police by reporting crimes.
