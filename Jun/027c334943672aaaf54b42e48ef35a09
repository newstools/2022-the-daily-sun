MANDLA “Mampintsha” Maphumulo and his family have disowned each other. This comes after his mum Zama Gumede and his sister, Pinki Gumede, recently complained to Daily Sun that they were not paid for appearing on season one of his reality show Uthando Lodumo. Zama was allegedly paid R10 000 for season two and Pinki R5 000. They’ve now decided to leave the show. “I’ll no longer participate in this show unless they give me my money,” Zama told the SunTeam. After the two spoke out, Mampintsha allegedly phoned his family members and disowned them. Zama said: “He called and accused me of bad mouthing him to Showmax and the producers. He’s angry that I exposed him. He said he wants nothing to do with us because we’re jealous of his success. “I don’t care because he doesn’t buy me anything.

I’m therefore asking Showmax to delete all the episodes that show my face.” Pinki said Mampintsha insulted them and said they brought him bad luck. “He said we are jealous and trying to bring him down. He said he doesn’t need us because this is his project. We are seeking legal advice to demand our money from Showmax,” she said. MultiChoice executive head for programming, Nomsa Philiso, said Showmax could not intervene in the relationships between family members. “Parental Advisory Productions is producing Uthando Lodumo, and we respect that the relationship between cast and production companies is subject to the agreements between them.” Mampintsha didn’t answer his phone or reply to text messages at the time of going to print.
