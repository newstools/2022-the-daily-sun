TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula met families of the people who died in a bus and truck accident. The accident happened near Bundu Inn outside Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane on Friday, 10 June. Mbalula met the families of the 15 dead people at the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University’s hall on Wednesday, 15 June. He said government agencies were there to offer information and to also explain the services available to families, specifically the Road Accident Fund (RAF). “This has been a difficult period for the families and there is little or nothing we can do to make them better. We communicated our condolences to them,” he said. “This is a terrible and chilling road crash with many lives lost and many more people sustaining injuries. It is another sad reminder that our work on road safety is a matter of serious and national importance and a responsibility for all of us.” Mbalula told the families that RAF will help them bury their loved ones, but the RAF law only pays after seven days. He pleaded with families to talk to undertakers to make them aware that they can help them bury their loved once the money is paid after seven days. He said he understands that some families don’t have money for burials. Mbalula also said he doesn’t want to seem as if government has abandoned them. He said government should help so that people can be buried in a dignified way. He added that they still don’t know the cause of the accident. “We have instituted an investigation as it is inquired by the law to determine the cause of the accident. I will get the report regarding the accident on Friday,” he said. One of the grieving family members, Jan Tlou, said: “We lost our brother. My brother died and is sleeping in a mortuary. It’s not long ago that he got a job and he was a breadwinner.” He thanked the minister for supporting the affected families.
