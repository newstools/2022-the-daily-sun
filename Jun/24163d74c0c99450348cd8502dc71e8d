SIX people were killed following a horrific accident involving two sedans on the R71 near Letsetele-Letaba Junction outside Tzaneen in Limpopo on Saturday evening, 25 June. According to Limpopo Department of Transport and Community Safety spokesman Mike Maringa, it is alleged that the driver of a speeding Ford sedan lost control of the vehicle and collided head-on with an oncoming VW sedan before the vehicles burst into flames. “The driver was pulled out of the burning car by security personnel from the nearby filling station. All the five occupants in the VW were certified dead on the scene. “The deceased are ranging between the ages of 35 and 50 years. Reckless driving is cited as a possible cause of the accident,” Maringa said. The Ford driver also succumbed to his injuries. In another incident also reported in Mopani on the R40, a 19-year-old passenger was killed when a driver of a Toyota SUV that they were travelling in lost control of the vehicle and it overturned.
