THE owner of two pairs of takkies worth over R2 000 hung his prized possessions on the washing line to dry after washing them – but was being watched. When he turned his back, thieves were quick to sneak off with his Nikes and Jordans. The takkie owner, who lives in Etwatwa, Benoni in Ekurhuleni heard from locals that the thieves had sold them and then went in search of the thugs together with other residents. When they found them, one got away but the other was taught a lesson. It seems they had sold both pairs for only R80. The one thief had taken them to a street vendor who had bought the takkies and he had no choice but return them. He was given a stern talking to about dealing in stolen goods. “You are lucky we don’t report you to the police,” said a resident. Locals said they were tired of crime in their area. They said to report it was often a waste of time because police didn’t arrest the culprits. The owner, who recovered his takkies, said it was sad they couldn’t hang their clothes and leave them on the washing line. “We have to guard our property with our lives!” he said. The thief ran away after residents had moered him. One resident said: “Because thugs are not arrested, we are pushed into taking the law into our own hands. “We know it’s wrong but we are pushed to desperate ends.” Etwatwa police urged the residents to work with them to fight crime.
