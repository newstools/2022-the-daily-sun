CITY Power is concerned about a rise in attacks on its staff. Spokesman, Isaac Mangena, told Daily Sun on the night of Sunday, 26 June security officers were shot at, leaving one wounded in the Eikenhof area of Joburg. He said the two officers were doing their regular patrol in the bushes near the Eikenhof substation when they were ambushed by an unknown number of men suspected to be cable thieves, who started shooting. “A shoot-out ensued, with the two security officers clearly outnumbered and outgunned. One of them was shot and rushed to Milpark Hospital,” he said. Mangena said Eikenhof was a hot spot for cable theft. “This is partly due to the vast open bushy spaces where our cables are supplying Naturena, Kibler Park and other areas,” he said. Mangena said the shooting was proof that izinyoka were brazen and dangerous. “We’re no longer dealing with common criminals but well-resourced individuals.” City Power called on the SAPS to do more to help the entity fight cable theft and vandalism. Mangena said this should include regular patrols and raids in identified hot spots. “Cases of attempted murder, tampering with and attempted theft of essential infrastructure were opened with the police.” Meanwhile, 18 cases of vandalism and theft of cables, fuses and breakers were reported between Friday, 24 June and Sunday, 26 June. “One suspect was arrested in Fairlands for possession of fuses stolen from a transformer substation in the area,” Mangena explained. He said this was becoming a problem. He urged residents to work with the police to put those responsible behind bars.
