VUSIMUZI Ntuli, who was shot and killed at Moloto Big Tree Mall in Moloto, Tshwane, on 28 May, was laid to rest on Saturday, 4 June, at Bronkhorspruit Cemetery. Family and friends came in their numbers to pay their last respects. Daily Sun published the story on 3 June headlined: “Shot dead for making noise.” Vusimuzi’s mother, Pauline Ntuli (42), from Zithobeni in Tshwane told Daily Sun she is still in pain as it was hard to lose a son who left behind a five-year-old child. Her plea is that the guard who allegedly shot her son must take care of the child. “Since my son was shot no one there (at the mall) is talking to me about the incident, which is hurting me. I am left with a child without a father,” she said. ALSO READ: Joy as 310 initiates return home alive! The family claimed family members went to the mall for answers but they were turned away by security. Pauline said she wants to see justice done because her son didn’t deserve to die like that. Simphiwe Ntuli (25) said his brother’s death has left them with many questions. “What we want to see is justice and the person who killed Vusimuzi to take care of his child,” he said. Vusimuzi’s friend Rebone Masuku (22) said they were shocked to hear the sad news of his death. “He loved people and always made sure that he kept them happy with his jokes. When we see his son, we will always remember him,” she said. The family members said they are still struggling to come to terms with Vusimuzi’s death. Gauteng Police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo, said a case of murder was opened. No arrest has been made yet. The manager at JB Security, who identified himself only as ‘Palma’ said: “We are aware of the incident. The matter is under investigation with the police and we won’t comment on it.” Palma referred the SunTeam to Cullinan Police Station.
