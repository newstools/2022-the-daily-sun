ALTHOUGH the hall is nothing like their comfortable homes, the support flood victims keep receiving is making a difference. The Ntuzuma flood victims in KZN have been receiving support in the form of clothes and food. Supporters from Greater Mogale City Orlando Pirates Football Club from Kagiso, Mogale City collected clothes and blankets and donated them to the flood victims on Monday, 30 May. The supporters collected the clothes and blankets around their area and in Soweto. They wanted to lend a helping hand to KZN residents who were affected by the floods, and Ntuzuma was in their heart as there’s also a supporters branch in the area. One of the beneficiaries Nozipho Sithole (35) from Ntuzuma E told Daily Sun that she lost her entire house, where she lived with her mother and son. “At the moment we stay in the community hall. Although we don’t have a home, we’re grateful that we have each other. Our lives matter and we thank God for saving us,” she said. She said living in the hall was uncomfortable, but it’s the only place they have right now. “It’s very hard. There are a lot of people here. There’s a lot of noise as well. “But with all that is happening, there are people out there who still remember us and donate. That make us happy and give us hope,” she said. Chairman of the Ntuzuma branch, Zinja Mdlalose, said about 18 beneficiaries received the donations. “People really appreciated the donation and were pleased with it,” he said.
