MOST train stations, especially those in Soweto, which are part of the Vereeniging to Joburg Park Station line, have been looted so much that they look like skeletons. Some of the worst hit like Kwaggastroom, Residensia, Kliptown, Mlamlankunzi and others can hardly be called train stations anymore. The stench of urine in what was once plush toilets and offices in Mlamlankunzi Station is unbearable. Most material, like roofs, gates, cables and any movable objects have been stolen at all these stations.

Interestingly, there are security guards who are guarding these stations despite them being looted. People who suffer the most are the commuters, especially those who earn very little to afford the high daily taxi fares. A vendor, who still sells at Residensia station in Sebokeng, said his customers have disappeared. He consoles himself by selling to passersby who use the station bridge to get home. The man said nobody seems to care about the plight of the commuters. Lillian Mofokeng, acting provincial manager at Gauteng Metrorail, said Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa was committed to ensuring services are restored speedily. “The community can be assured that procurement processes are in progress to rebuild the railway infrastructure packages in Gauteng,” she said.
