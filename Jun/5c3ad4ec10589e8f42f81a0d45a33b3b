A RELATIVE has alleged that the son wanted money for drugs. And when his mum told him she didn’t have it, he allegedly bashed her head against the wall and strangled her. He then took his mum’s car and fled. Stepfather Johannes Mavuso (45) said they were devastated about the incident, that happened on 1 June. “On the way he confessed to his friend that he killed his mother, and he advised him to hand himself over to the police,” he said. The 22-year-old then handed himself over at Etwatwa cop shop in Ekurhuleni on the same day. And when cops and the paramedics arrived at the house, they found Mahlodi Mavuso (45) lying dead on the floor. Johannes said he wasn’t home at the time of incident. “I received a call and rushed home. I’m so broken. I never thought my wife would die at the hands of her son,” he said. He said that the suspect had always been problematic and his wife wanted help for him, but he was aggressive towards them.  “My wife was an auxiliary social worker and about to graduate into a fully fledged social worker. She was loved because of her warmth,” he said. Mahlodi’s mother, Elizabeth Gumbo (72), said she still could not believe she was gone. She confirmed that her grandson had a substance abuse problem. “I spoke to her four days before her death, and she was happy.” She said when she received the bad news, her heart almost stopped. “Mahlodi was my friend and she knew how to cheer me up.” Mother-in-law Sesi (70) said Mahlodi was a humble makoti. A murder case was opened at Etwatwa Police Station.
