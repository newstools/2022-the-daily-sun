MPUMALANGA cops arrested a 16-year-old teen mum for the murder of her two-week-old baby in Calcutta on Thursday, 2 June. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the grandmother woke up in the morning to discover that the baby was missing. “She searched but couldn’t find her. She also asked the baby’s mother, but she refused to speak. The gogo then reported the matter to the police, who questioned the mum,” Mohlala said in a statement. He added that the teen admitted to killing the baby and stuffing her body in a schoolbag. “She also led the police to the room where she had hidden the bag. She was arrested, and is expected to appear in court soon,” he said. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela described the incident as tragic and unfortunate. She further urged young mothers to seek help from relevant organisations in order to lessen the burden to prevent such tragic incidents.
