THINK back to when you were eight years old, and your main concern was probably getting home from school in time for your favourite cartoons and deciding which chocolate bar to buy from the spaza shop. But, life couldn’t be any different for Truth Jones from Atlanta, USA, who wrote his first book The Win Within when he was just eight. “It’s about three things – faith, family and football,” the 14-year-old millionaire said. WATCH: A 12 year old self made millionaire! Amazingly, the primary school pupil and his mum managed to get his book published, and Truth claimed to have made $5 000 (about R80 000) in sales in just 90 days. And while most kids would happily spend this cash on toys or games, Truth decided to save it for something special. The New York Post reported that the following year, the then nine-year-old became interested in the stock market. His mum Janel said: “I thought he was a little too young to understand the concepts. However, he came back to me and started speaking the terminology and jargon they speak in the stock market. He asked if he could open his broker account and from that moment, I knew he was serious.” Truth claimed: “I started off with $3 000 (about R47 000) and in three years, I had turned that into $1 million (about R16 million).” As a result, the teenager now has his own business called The Truth Speaks, where he teaches other people how to begin investing in the stock market.
