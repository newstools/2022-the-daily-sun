COMMUNITIES around Rustenburg in North West marched to the Impala Platinum Mine on Tuesday, 28 June, and demanded that it should employ more locals. Residents also want the mine to move away from using labour brokers, who they said exploited the workers. The march, which was led by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Bojanala region, started at Freedom Park, outside Rustenburg, and ended at the Impala offices, where a memorandum of demands was handed over. A resident, Aobakwe Sekete (32), said they were tired of sitting at home while mines benefited from their land. “The march is also in support of workers who are oppressed by the mine. We are fighting for our rights and call on local mines to do right by developing communities,” he said. Mothusi Montwedi, EFF’s deputy provincial chairman, said the mine was only concerned about making profit while failing to develop host communities. He said the mine used labour brokers who exploited workers by paying them very little salaries. In the memorandum, the EFF demanded job creation, business opportunities, increased wages and additional benefits such as medical and transport allowance for workers. The party said it was committed to fighting capitalists and securing better living conditions for people. Tumelo Nkitse, an Impala human resources executive, received the memorandum and said the mine would engage and respond within the given time period, which is two weeks. “We will review the memorandum and engage on the demands with the relevant authorities,” said Nkitse.
