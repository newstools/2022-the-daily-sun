NONKULULEKO Maphisa has launched a foundation to assist widows and children in the Zululand area. Nonkululeko, the wife of Abaqulusi Municipality Mayor Mncedisi Maphisa, said she aimed to help fight poverty. Speaking at the official launch of the Maphisa Foundation in Vryheid, KZN, on the night of Friday, 10 June, she said she and her husband wanted to do something after seeing the plight of widows and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Nonkululeko said the foundation would not discriminate in terms of gender but its main priority would be widows and children heading families.

For example, we will go to those families headed by kids and assist with school fees, proper shelter, if it is needed and other long-term interventions to make sure we take out our communities from poverty,” she said.  The mayor said it gave him hope that the organisation would reach deep into Zululand. KZN businessman Musa Myeni said it was a great initiative and he was happy it would help both genders. Myeni said many foundations were formed to assist women but none focusing on men. “There are men out there who have left their homes and turned to alcohol because of their abusive environment. “We need a foundation that will not just look at the issues of women but also attend to the plight of men.” “If a woman is being assisted, make sure her son or husband is not left out to build a proper society.” He said only focusing on women could create monsters out of men and young boys who were left out.
