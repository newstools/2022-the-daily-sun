NO children bunk school in this kasi! Residents have formed a group to keep an eye on kids, even waiting at the school gates to make sure no one was late. Latecomers are punished by picking up litter around the kasi, leading them to arriving on time. Staff at Kgothalang Secondary School in Bekkersdal, Gauteng, said they were happy with the initiative by residents as it was forcing kids to take their education seriously. “We used to have a large number of pupils coming late,” said one teacher. Group member Melusi Zungu (24) said they would not tolerate lateness and bunking. “This is not going to happen in our kasi. We want kids to get matric. Whether they study further is up to them and their parents.” Lucky Mosimane (43) said they decided to take action as the number of kids who loitered around during school hours was concerning. “When we asked them what was going on, most said they were locked out because they were late.” And since they started checking up on the kids, most had changed their behaviour. “We take them home to tell their parents that they bunk classes.” One parent, whose child used to wake up late, said she had seen an improvement.
