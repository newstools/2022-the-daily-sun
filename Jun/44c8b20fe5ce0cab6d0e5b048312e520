HUNDREDS of churchgoers from Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Southern Africa donated blood on Saturday, 28 May. This to help to ease the national blood shortage. Spokesman Msizi Mngwaza said: “Churches from different cities and towns across Southern Africa decided to organise a national blood drive. Although the Eastern Cape drive mainly took place in Gqeberha, we hope it will spread to other cities across the province.” Mngwaza said they wanted to help the community and save lives in this time of shortage. Congregant Cleo Solomons said: “I hope the one unit I donated will save more lives. I am excited that many other members have also decided to do the same.” ALSO READ | POISONED KIDS: HE SAW DEATH COMING! Another churchgoer Nolwazi Bengu said: “Our hearts are for helping people. We moved as fast as lightning to organise the blood drive. This is the very least that we can do.” South African National Blood Service (SANBS) senior specialist for donor relations Willem van der Merwe said blood transfusion was a core service in the healthcare system, and donors provided a unique contribution to the health and survival of others. “Continuous education and understanding is key in ensuring the sustainability of this life-saving resource. When one donates blood, they give patients the gift of a second chance that science cannot create,” he said.
