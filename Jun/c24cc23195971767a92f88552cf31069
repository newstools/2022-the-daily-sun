THUGS pretend to be collecting scrap metal but they are just lying in wait. When residents of Spooktown in Bekkersdal, Gauteng, pass by, they pounce on them, threaten them with guns and take their valuables. On 5 June, a 33-year-old woman was going to work when a thug appeared out of nowhere. He shot her in the arm and ran off with her handbag. She said her cellphone, house keys and money were in the bag. In terrible pain, she managed to walk to nearby houses to seek help. She was taken to hospital, where she spent two weeks while doctors tried to fix the broken bones. She was released a few days ago. “I bought the cellphone recently and I had important information on it. “Thugs wait at the dumpsite pretending to be collecting scrap metal and you don’t suspect anything.” She said the thug didn’t look armed, but then he pulled out a gun. Sergeant Linkie Lefakane said an attempted murder case was opened and cops were hunting for the suspect. Residents are tired of crime around the dumpsite and vowed to hunt the thugs. “They pretend to be collecting rubbish meanwhile they know they are waiting for innocent people to rob,” said resident Noah Ngwenya.
