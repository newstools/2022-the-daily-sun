WHEN she first became a sangoma 29 years ago, life was good. But things took a turn for the worse when Sontaga “Mafelempini” Mmamphsika (61) moved from Mamelodi to Tshwane suburb Meyerspark in 1999. She said her ancestors refused to move with her and she was left unable to use her gift. She said since then, her life had been filled with bad luck. Mafelempini said she did all the necessary rituals and ceremonies to introduce her amadlozi to her new house but nothing worked. “I have lost clients and even my husband left me in 2015 without saying a word. Everything is just falling apart. “When amadlozi visit, they will just look at me. Actually, they will be talking in signs and what worries me is that I don’t know what they are saying anymore,” she said.

She said she believed her ancestors were angry and that’s why they turned against her. “I have suffered enough and I don’t know what to do,” she said. Mafelempini said she visited different izangoma to consult but she was not getting any help. She said she was looking for a powerful sangoma who could help her reconnect with her amadlozi before it was too late. Her daughter said her mum was suffering. “It hurts to see my mother going through these hardships and challenges, which also affect us,” she said. Traditional healer Majoko Hlongwane said Mafelempini needed to perform rituals in a river to apologise to her amadlozi for leaving them behind when she moved. “After performing rituals, she will have to take them through the gate at her home,” she said.
