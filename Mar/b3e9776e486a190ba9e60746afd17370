CONTINUOUS load shedding is negatively affecting residents of Polokwane, Limpopo. This is because three reservoirs are now empty due to the impact of load shedding. According to the Polokwane Municipality, the reservoirs were sitting at 0%, despite the Olifantspoort and Ebenezer plants being in operation. Areas such as Bendor, Sterpark, Flora Park, Serala View, Nirvana, Moregloed, Ivydale and the extensions in Polokwane were the most affected. Sara Mojapelo (41) from Extension 133 said they had been struggling with water since load shedding started last week. “We only get water at night, and nothing during the day. “We are forced to wake up to collect more water so we can use it during the day. It’s really a struggle,” she told Daily Sun. Municipality spokesman Matshidiso Mothapo said the Lepelle Northern Water indicated the combination of load shedding and higher demand for power were affecting water supply and the balancing of reservoirs. “All consumers are encouraged to continue using as little water as possible to help in the recovery of reservoir levels. Those who continue to receive uninterrupted water supply are encouraged to use water sparingly. “While the municipality is working with Lepelle Northern Water on the recovery of reservoir levels, water tankers will be helping with the water supply,” said Mothapo.
