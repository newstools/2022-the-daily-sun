A MAN has confessed to splashing out over $4 000 (about R60 000) to have his 4-5 extended by 2.5 cm after his 7cm penis was cruelly mocked by lovers. The German man spent years trying to increase the size of his 4-5, even turning to “penis pumps” in desperation, as he felt he came up short in that department. His penis measured “only three inches” (about 7cm), whereas the average length in Germany is just over five inches (about 12.7 cm) when erect. The 36-year-old battled against ruthless insults from women he bedded and, feeling ashamed of his size, felt scared to have sex. The New York Post reports that one of the woman told him right in the face that he wasn’t well equipped. On a desperate mission to increase the length, he tried all sorts of ways to overcome his problem forking out hundreds in the process. “I tried pills, creams, penis pumps, and expanders to make my penis longer,” he explained. “I spent over $1 000 (approximately R15 000) and nothing worked,” he added. After exhausting all other options, he went to see a doctor in Hanover who specialises in the “autologous fat method” to have his penis extended by an inch. Despite the fact that the size difference was minor, it came at a hefty price of around R60 000. Dr Christian Kerpen, a plastic and aesthetic surgery specialist from Cosmopolitan Aesthetics, performed the 60-minute procedure. “Two centimetres in length and size make a big difference,” he said of the outcome.
