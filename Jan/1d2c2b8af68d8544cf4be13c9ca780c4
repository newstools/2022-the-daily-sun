MARITZBURG United defender, Lungelo Bhengu, has chosen to play football to avoid social ills in the dusty streets of Landskop. Bhengu opened up the club’s official website that he avoid negative behaviours in the crime and drugs infested streets. He claims he was the darling of his kasi with most showering him praise. “On top of that, people from my community used to tell me I am a good player, (and) that I must work hard (advising) one day I’ll become a professional player. I had the passion for the game,” he was quoted by the Maritzburg United website. He’s even wondering what he would’ve become had he failed to make it as a professional footballer. “I really cannot imagine my life without football. I breathe, smell, and eat football. It’s life to me,” he said. He advised the upcoming youngsters to stay far away from drugs and focus on football. He also urged them to respect coaches and their teammates. ??
