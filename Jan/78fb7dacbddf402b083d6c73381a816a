He started doing that specific dance and we took a video of him doing it in different places. He went back home and took a proper video, which is the one he posted online,” said 9umba. “The video blew up and we had to quickly finish it up. We got offers from a lot of people asking to be part of the song and we brought all of them in. We didn’t want to leave anyone out, and we released the song quickly while it was still trending,” said Mdoovar. Toss said he’s grateful to have met Mdoovar and 9umba. They trio is working on more music, which they will release this year.
