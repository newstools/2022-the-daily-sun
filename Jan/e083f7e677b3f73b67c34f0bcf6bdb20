MOROCCO opened their Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) campaign with a hard-fought 1-0 win over stubborn Ghana at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo yesterday. It was a late striker from skilful winger Sofiane Boufal that proved to be the difference between the two African heavyweights in their Group C opener. Boufal, who plies his trade in France with League 1 side Angers, scored only his second international goal for the Atlas Lions in 23 appearances. The match had been rather dull up to the point when the former Southampton player turned smartly in the box to fire his side into the lead. It appears the two teams were feeling their way into the competition, pretty much canceling each other out. The Atlas Lions, though, were arguably the better team as they did their best to impose their will on a disciplined Ghanaian defence. And they were finally rewarded late on with Boufal getting the all-important breakthrough that earned his side maximum points. The Black Stars, on the other hand, were more than happy to sit back for the better part of the match and play on the counter. Milovan Rajevac's side seemed happy for a share of the spoils, but they had their hearts broken at the death with a sucker punch. They will be hoping to bounce back as they seek their fifth Afcon title. Ghana came into Cameroon as the third-most successful nation at the tournament, claiming the Afcon title on four different occasions. However, the Black Stars last conquered the continent four decades ago and will be looking to put that right this year. The Atlas Lions, meanwhile, will be looking to end their 45-year wait for the continental crown following their 1976 triumph. In other results, Zimbabwe also had their hearts broken as they lost 1-0 to Senegal thanks to a late Sadio Mane penalty. Malawi were downed 1-0 by Guinea.
