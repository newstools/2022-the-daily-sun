It breaks my heart to hear how some parents brag about buying their kids expensive clothes for Christmas and New Year’s Day. This pressure parents put themselves through is unnecessary. They even say they don’t want their kids to be undermined by others. What kind of society have we become? A parent’s responsibility is to instil pride, self-confidence and love so kids feel valued – no matter what they have or don’t. Let’s teach our kids to be responsible and stop the obsession with buying expensive clothes to make them look better than their peers.
