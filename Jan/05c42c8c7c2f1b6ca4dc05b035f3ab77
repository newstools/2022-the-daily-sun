FORGOTTEN former Black Leopards midfielder Ivan Mahangwahaya is back at Lidoda Duvha. The 32-year-old has been invited to train with the Venda-based GladAfrica Championship side with the hope of impressing coach Joel Masutha and earn a contract. Mahangwahaya was part of the team that helped Leopards gain promotion to the DStv Premiership in 2018, with Masutha in charge. Mahangwahaya does not have a club this campaign after he parted ways with Polokwane City at the end of last season. “Yes, he (Mahangwahaya) is one of the players who is trying his luck at Leopards,” said SunSport’s source. “The good thing for him is that he has worked with Masutha before and he knows him very well. “But it’s up to him to show that he still has what it takes to play in the Championship and help Leopards move from the relegation zone with his experience.” After leaving Leopards in 2019, Mahangwahaya joined defunct Bidvest Wits under the four times PSL winning coach Gavin Hunt. He also played for Baroka before joining Rise and Shine. Another player who is reported to be training with Leopards is their former striker, Rendani Ndou. The 34-year-old has also been without a team this season. Ndou played for Leopards in 2014 until 2018 and left them to join their Limpopo rivals City. “We will make an official announcement when we have signed the players,” said Masutha. “Our focus now is to work hard with our players preparing for the league to resume in February. “I cannot talk about rumours regarding the players who are training with us as I don’t know anything about that.” Meanwhile, Leopards are set to move from Polokwane’s Peter Mokaba Stadium to use Malamulele Stadium as their new home ground when the league resumes next month.
