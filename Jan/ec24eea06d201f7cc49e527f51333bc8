WHAT do Kim Kardashian, SZA and Uncle Waffles have in common? Besides being successful and influential celebrities, they are also known for wearing clothes that reveal their underwear, especially G-strings and thongs. While some might find this unsettling, this is a fashion trend with a deeper fashion history to it. According to https://www.lofficielusa.com, the history of wearing visible G-strings and thongs began with burlesque dancers in the 1930s as part of their performance costumes. This trend, then coined the “whale tail trend”, made its fashion debut at Jean Paul Gaultier’s Spring/Summer 1997 runway show, that included exposed undergarments, thongs and briefs. Thereafter, Tom Ford’s Spring/Summer 1997 collection for Gucci featured models walking out with only G-strings on their lower bodies. Thin thong straps were also featured, this time with clothes over them, for the Spring/Summer 1998 collection. This trend was further amplified in the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards when Britney Spears performed her hit-song Oops!... I Did It Again in a gold two-piece set with a bedazzled built-in G-string. Thereafter, Christina Aguilera and Halle Berry rocked the VMAs red carpet with high-waist underwear straps showing. But now this 90s trend, that eventually fizzled out, has made a huge fashion comeback. According to celebrity stylist Rochelle White, there has been a shift in fashion and trends during the pandemic, thanks to platforms like TikTok. Old fashion trends, that had fizzled out, have now come back to the fore. As Emma Golley once said: “The future of fashion is actually about taking a step back and redirecting the path it’s been going in over the last 20 years of consumption.”
