PRECIOUS Mnyamane has been living in fear since a relative allegedly killed her 14-year-old son. The body of her son Siyabonga was found hidden under a mattress in his room two days after Christmas. The 45-year-old mum from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, said her son’s malume vowed to return to kill the whole family after he was arrested. She said the family later found petrol bombs hidden in his room. Precious said the police took away two of the bombs but three were left behind. “We don’t know if the police knew what they were doing,” she said. Members of the family showed the SunTeam some of the bombs and a letter with instructions on where to find the body. They said they hoped the suspect (21) would rot in jail. “He is a danger to us and it would be dangerous if they released him on bail,” she said. A relative said after the suspect appeared in court on 15 January, police visited to say he would be released on bail. “We had to fight for him not to be released. We went to the magistrate with evidence of the petrol bombs and the letter and the court denied him bail,” she said. “We wish he could stay there forever. That boy looks like he’s possessed by something.” The devastated mum said she was renting a room somewhere else because she was haunted by bad memories in the family home. Precious said in the room where her son was killed, they found a knife, panga, fork and spade. We believe he was killed with these things because he had broken bones all over,” she said. Colonel Molatelo Maoto of Etwatwa police said the police might have not seen the bombs at the time, but would go back to fetch the remaining bombs.
