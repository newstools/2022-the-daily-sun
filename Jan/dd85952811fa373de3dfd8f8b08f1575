Talk show legend and TV presenter Aaron Moloisi (42) is celebrating two decades in the entertainment industry. To mark this milestone, the media personality has launched an online radio station, Legend Radio, that will broadcast in more than 12 countries across the globe – gunning for more countries in the next few years. Speaking to SunBuzz, Aaron explained how the idea of the station came about. “It happened after having a stint as a presenter on Radio Bop as a breakfast show host. My plan was to stay at the station for six months and assess if it’s something I want to do longer,” he said. “Having left the station last month while I was at home relaxing something pulled me back into radio and I started researching the radio spectrum in Mzansi and made calls and the rest is history. Everything happened very fast because the next day I had to scout for presenters.” ALSO READ : I’LL MAKE MZANSI PROUD! Aaron said the radio station will have a star-studded line-up, including Nigerian superstar Denrele Edu who hosted Lip Sync Battle Africa. He said the station doesn’t have a specific focus. “We’re not a categorised content genre. We engage in a wider array of subject matters in all aspects.” Talking about why he decided to make the station a global one, Aaron said he believes he has done enough in terms of South Africa, and it is time he spreads his wings. He said that the station will broadcast in English but in between, there will be a mix of other languages. The Limpopo-born presenter also said that he will be releasing a book soon that will tell his story through the eyes of his gogo who raised him.
