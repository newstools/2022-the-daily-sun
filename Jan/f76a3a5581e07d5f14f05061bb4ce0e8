SINGER and songwriter 3FY5 is making major moves in the music scene. The musician’s latest track Dogmore has been topping the charts and has also become a street anthem. Speaking to SunBuzz, the musician, whose real name is Lungile Ndlovu, said the song is a tribute to all those who paved the way for kwaito music. “Recently a long-term dream of mine was realised. I got a distribution deal with Kalawa Jazmee and I got the opportunity to chill and learn from legends such as Spikiri. “In that moment I felt as if I’ve made it in life and this song describes exactly that – success,” said 3FY5. The Soweto-born musician said working on the song was an eye-opener. “It made me realise that there is no limitation when it comes to music, all you have to be is creative and magic will happen. I truly enjoyed myself and I’m hoping for more like that one, because I am all about growth and learning,” he said.
