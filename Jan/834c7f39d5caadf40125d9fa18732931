 VETERAN actor Patrick Shai has died. He died on Saturday, 22 January, in a suspected suicide incident. His family confirmed the death in a statement. “It with great sadness to announce the passing of veteran actor ntate Patrick,” the family said in part, asking for space and time to deal with the painful loss. It is alleged that the actor, who was spearheading a fight against gender-based violence, was found dead in his garage, hanging from a rope. And, the reasons behind the alleged suicide are still unknown. Last week, Shai dominated headlines after a video of him challenging rapper Cassper Nyovest to a boxing match went viral. In the video, Shai used inappropriate language. Then he posted another video, apologising to the rapper and Mzansi for the initial one. Outside his house, members of the community and those from the organisation he had been working with descended there as law enforcement officers went in and out of the house. Police and forensic investigators are currently on scene and have closed off the street, where the body has not yet been removed from the house. Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo said: “Police have opened an inquest docket after an actor was found dead in his house in Dobsonville. Police were called to the scene and on arrival, found a family member who showed them the body in the garage. He was certified dead on the scene. Police have opened an inquest docket, and preliminary investigations have ruled out any suspicion of foul play.” This is a developing story.
