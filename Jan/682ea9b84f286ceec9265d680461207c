MOSIMANEGAPE Thebe wishes his parents were still alive to witness him work as a traditional healer and prophet. The 33-year-old from Jouberton in Klerksdorp, North West, said his mother died when he was eight and his father when he was 13. “After my father died, I started hearing voices calling my name and I was the only one who heard them. I prayed for them to go away as I was a Christian but they didn’t leave,” he said. “At the clinic, they could not tell what was wrong with me. I was later diagnosed with TB but three weeks later, they said I didn’t have it. However, I was advised to continue taking the treatment.” Mosimanegape said his legs then became painful and swollen. “I was unable to walk and I dreamed about water and skeletons. In my dreams, I was told that the only cure for my sickness was to become a healer.” Mosimanegape said he spent three months going through the initiation process to become a traditional healer and three months to become a prophet. “This is how I stopped feeling pain and seeing things no one else saw.” Mosimanegape said he was good at healing children’s diseases like phogwane, a condition which makes the soft spot on a baby’s skull sink in. “I have saved more than 100 children since I became a traditional healer at 19.” Mosimanegape said he was also the provincial chairman for Traditional Health Practitioners. He is also a volunteer at Alabama Clinic Forum where he encouraged people to get vaccinated. “Vaccination is a way to protect ourselves, our families and friends.”
