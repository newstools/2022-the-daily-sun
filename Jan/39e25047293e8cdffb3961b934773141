LESS than a week into Big Brother Mzansi, a contestant has already dropped out. Keamogetswe “QV” Motlhale left the reality show due to mental health issues. The 23-year-old from Mahikeng, North West, said she was not in a good state and needed to work on herself. She left the house on Wednesday, 26 January, just days after its premiere on Sunday. Speaking to her housemates, she said: “I want to be vulnerable with you guys but it’s hard. I feel like for me to progress, I probably need to speak to someone I’m safe with,” she said. “I’ve spoken to Big Brother and he advised me to give it 24 hours. I tried, but it just keeps getting worse.” ALSO READ : MANDELA GRANDSON ADMITS TO ABUSE!
