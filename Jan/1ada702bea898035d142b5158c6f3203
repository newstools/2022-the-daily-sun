SOUTH Africa batting consultant Justin Sammons has full confidence in the abilities of struggling batsman Aiden Markram. Markram has found the going tough with the willow of late, enduring a lean patch in Test cricket. The 27-year-old is yet to make an impact in the ongoing series against India, with his highest score being 31 in the second innings of the second Test at the Wanderers. Markram showed glimpses of his quality in that knock but his persistent issues with his footwork reared their ugly head again. His static footwork saw him caught in the crease and trapped in front by Shardul Thakur. Nevertheless, batting consultant Sammons saw enough to suggest it won’t be long until Markram returns to his best. “We all know the quality player that Aiden is,” said Sammons, who has been enlisted to assist the team’s batting for the remainder of the summer. “That’s not going to change over three or four innings and he showed glimpses of what he’s capable of. “He’s also received some good balls and those would have got most batters out. He just needs to stick to his processes and keep doing what he’s doing. “His preparation has been very good, and he must trust it will come through because as a coaching staff, we do.” Markram is yet to make an impact in the series having been dismissed for scores of 13, 1, 7 and most recently 31 in his four innings so far. He has particularly struggled against India’s Mohammed Shami, who got him out twice in the first Test at Centurion just over a week ago. Markram’s poor form has seen the Proteas struggle to put together a solid opening partnership, with fellow opener Dean Elgar often having to rebuild. This has also seen number three batsman Keegan Petersen effectively turn into an opener, regularly coming in early to face a relatively new ball.
