SOUTH African Union of Students (SAUS) secretary-general Yandisa Ndzoyiya said they will not accept mandatory vaccination at universities. He said they recently met the Department of Higher Education and Training to express their disappointment about six universities that have already called for mandatory vaccination. “Instead, these universities must engage students on why they want mandatory vaccination. “The moment the universities start talking about mandatory vaccination, it will make people start believing in conspiracy theories,” said Ndzoyiya. He said the fight against the virus was not about being compliant, but about health. “When masks were introduced, you would see some people exchange masks at the mall. “To them it was about complying, not their health hence I’m saying forcing students is not the way to go. Convince them why they must be vaccinated than just imposing it on them,” said Ndzoyiya. Pat Nyamutswa, a third-year student at the University of Western Cape, said: “I don’t have any problem with being vaccinated, but when the university makes it mandatory we have to know why. As far as I understand, if you are vaccinated, you can get infected with the virus and spread it.” Among the universities that intend to implement mandatory vaccination is the University of Cape Town, Stellenbosch University, University of Free State, University of Johannesburg, University of Witwatersrand and University of Western Cape.
