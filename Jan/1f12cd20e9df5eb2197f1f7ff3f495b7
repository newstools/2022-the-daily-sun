CAPE Town Mayor Geordin Lewis-Hill said people of Mzansi can’t afford to pay more for electricity as they are already struggling to deal with Covid-19 hardships. Lewis-Hill said this on Wednesday, 19 January while presenting his oral submissions to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa’s (Nersa) public hearings on Eskom’s application to increase the price of electricity by 20,5% in the 2022/2023 financial year. “Like the majority of South Africans, many Capetonians are struggling to make ends meet. The pandemic and national lockdown led to the closure of hundreds of businesses in our city and the loss of thousands of jobs,” said Lewis-Hill. He said Eskom must find other means to take itself out of financial trouble than throw the burden on struggling consumers who are already paying too much for electricity. Nersa has rejected Eskom’s request for the 2022/2023 tariff hike, but Eskom approached the courts to force Nersa. On 3 December, the high court issued a court order directing Nersa to consider the request. ALSO READ |

He said they must also fight corruption and mismanagement that cost them R14,6 billion in 2020 and R7,4 billion in 2019. More than 30 000 residents signed a petition against the increase of electricity tariffs. Resident Nobukhosi Jelele (48) said: “We can’t afford this increase. I lost my job last year and have been struggling to make ends meet.” Nersa’s public hearings are ongoing, and a decision will be announced on 25 February.
