FOR the past few months, mama Jobe has been dreaming of her late husband giving her money and amabele. So mama Jobe from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni wrote to Daily Sun to ask for help from Digital Bones’ Sangoma Nzama Maluleke. Nzama said there’s a possibility mama Jobe’s husband passed away when they had planned to do something, either a business or an investment. “Her husband is trying to communicate to her that she shouldn’t be afraid to continue with what they had started or were planning to start,” he said. He said her husband was telling her to use the money she had, be it from the insurance or his work. “He wants her not to abandon their plan, but to use the money she has to get the idea moving. Amabele means she must plant,” he said. Nzama said this dream all together meant whatever money mama Jobe had, she could use it towards the business if that was what they were planning to do. “It will come back multiplied like amabele. Amabele are like mealies. You plant one and reap more,” he said. Nzama said mama Jobe shouldn’t be afraid as her husband was looking out for her. “He is protecting her from the heavens. He will make sure whatever she tries succeeds,” he said. When called after Nzama’s interpretation, mama Jobe said her husband died after they started a security company. “It wasn’t doing well because of a lack of funds. When he died, I was afraid of using the money I got from his work,” she said. She said now that she had the message, she would take a portion and invest it in the business.
