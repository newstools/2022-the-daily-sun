CHIPPA United coach Kurt Lentjies is aware of the danger posed by the University of Pretoria, who they face in the Nedbank Cup last-32. The Chilli Boys reached the final of the tournament last season only to lose 1-0 to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, who are now known as Marumo Gallants. At that time, Lentjies was still a player. The 36-year-old has warned his players that reaching the final last year will not make things easy for them against AmaTuks, who also reached the final in 2009. The GladAfrica Championship side are in the last-32 of the Ke Yona Cup for the first time in six years. Speaking after the draw on Wednesday, Lentjies said AmaTuks are a close book to him, but they will not be an easy nut to crack. “The University of Pretoria away from home is always a tough fixture and they will be motivated that they are playing a PSL team,” Lentjies stated. “I cannot say I know much about them, but we have the time to have a look and do our analysis and see what they are about. But it is more important what we do on the field of play. We will prepare well for the game and look forward to getting the season re-started with the Nedbank Cup. Lentjies added: “Even though last season we went all the way to the final, we shouldn’t think it will be easy to get there again. But we want to win every game on offer, we must take it one game at a time. We will focus on what we need to do as a team and take it from there.” When the league resumes, Chippa will also be fighting for their lives in the DStv Premiership as they are not in a good position in the standings. They are 12th with 16 points from 17 games just three points away from the drop zone.
