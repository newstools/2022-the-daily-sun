FORMER Banyana Banyana striker Khabo Zitha believes her career was cut short by jealous people who wanted her to quit football. The 45-year-old claims she encountered many evil and unexplainable things during her playing days. She said what is still stuck in her mind is how she lost a scholarship at Alabama University in the United States, where she was supposed to play football. This happened in 2000 when she was in camp at Esselen Park Sport School of Excellence in Ekurhuleni, where they were camping for the Africa Cup of Nations. She said they played a friendly match against Zebra Force from Tshwane. “I entered the field well without feeling any pain. But I felt something hard click on my left knee. I fell and had a torn ligament, which ruined my career. “People will find it hard to understand no one broke my leg. I suspect evil spirits were behind such and jealous people,” she said. Khabo said the incident has been stuck in her mind for many years, because izangoma and prophets told her lightning was sent to end her career. “I was told I have many enemies from my community who wanted me to fail and for my career to end. I was so unfortunate as I had a recurring injury and had 13 operations on my left knee,” she said. Khabo said she sometimes felt like something was moving in her leg when she played. She said there was muthi in football and it affected players’ careers. Khabo played for Soweto Ladies between 1994 and 2005, and Banyana Banyana from 1993 to 2005.
