RESIDENTS and community leaders in Mamelodi have suggested that Parliament be housed in the area. The suggestion was made by various partners in the Tshwane kasi after the National Assembly burnt down recently. Sanco Mamelodi secretary Vusi Masemola said a letter would be written to the Speaker indicating the community’s interest in having Parliament in their area. “Sanco will represent the interest of all stakeholders and organisations that have met to champion the relocation of Parliament from Cape Town to Tshwane,” he said. Masemola said they had identified two suitable pieces of land. “The first is an area of D6, the location of the old Vista University where Reverend Stanley Mogoba, the late Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Dr Mathole Motshekga used to attend,” he said. “The second is an area towards Bronkhorstspruit, near Donkerhoek Tollgate.” He said the idea stemmed from the recommendation made by the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee that a multi-purpose centre be built ekasi to bring healing to the people hurt by apartheid. “That recommendation was never implemented by the justice department. Our view is that this is a good time to implement it,” he said. “Many activists who fought for the liberation of this country had their roots in political activism that started in Mamelodi.” Sanco was calling on the government not to rebuild the “colonial building”. The EFF recently said Parliament should be moved to Tshwane.
