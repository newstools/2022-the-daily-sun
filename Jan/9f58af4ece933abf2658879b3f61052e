Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has told elected councillors it was time for them to make sure people in their wards received proper services. He said he wanted each councillor to choose a municipal project they would monitor and if no progress was being made, they needed to disrupt councils until the project was given attention. Addressing thousands of supporters at a rally to thank them at the People’s Park in Durban on Saturday, 8 January, Malema said the EFF had a number of deputy mayors in KZN municipalities for the first time. In eThekwini, the party had grown to over 10% and had a representative in the municipality’s executive committee. “There must be no EFF councillor who will drown in power. We have no VIPs in the EFF. If you are elected as a councillor, you must remember why you were elected,” he said. “You must put the EFF first and remember the branches of the EFF. Most importantly, you must remember the mandate you were given by the people of your ward.” Malema said the party would be hiring an election specialist to ensure councillors were working on the ground. He said he wanted the party to become professional to prepare it to take over the government in 2024. He also urged to President Cyril Ramaphosa to open up the entertainment industry as it created a lot of jobs. He said poor people were hungry and closing the industry was taking food from their tables. “This corona thing is a scam. He is using it to continue with his term. He must open stadiums, we want to watch soccer. If he is able to host a political event at a soccer stadium, why doesn’t he want soccer spectators to watch their favourite teams playing?” he asked.
