BUSINESSWOMAN Thandi Thubana was gatvol of being robbed, so she decided to get three big dogs. But the dogs broke her heart on 24 December when they killed her 18-month-old grandchild. The 47-year-old from Phola Park near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga said her granddaughter Hlelo was even friends with the dogs. “I trusted dogs because after I got them, thugs stopped attacking me. “When I went to the shop on Christmas Eve, my grandchild was asleep on the bed,” she said. “When I came back, I saw a doll lying on the veranda. I picked it up because I didn’t want the dogs to play with it. “I got the shock of my life when I realised it wasn’t a doll, but my granddaughter. “She was soaked in blood. “It was dripping from her neck and she had a big wound. “I didn’t know what to do, so I screamed for help.”  Thandi said she didn’t know how her granddaughter got out of the bedroom. “The dogs were her friends. She used to play with them. I suspect the neighbours’ kids were playing with crackers and they took out their anger on her. “I can’t believe the same dogs she grew up playing with turned against her,” she said. Thandi said her daughter was so traumatised she was undergoing counselling in Tshwane. She said the dogs had since been put down by the local SPCA. Colonel Donald Mdluli confirmed the incident and said an inquest docket was opened and being investigated.
