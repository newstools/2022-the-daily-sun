SHE opened a TikTok account in September, where she posts Xhosa traditional songs. But to her surprise, a lot of people started to share her clips and told her she was good at singing Xhosa traditional songs. Zizipho Jonas said some people even put her on Facebook and she has been trending. “I was shocked because I was doing the videos just to have some fun. I’m so happy people find my videos entertaining,” she said. The 22-year-old from Samora Machel in Cape Town said she will now use the opportunity to teach people about Xhosa culture.  “I did the videos effortlessly because I was doing something I love. It’s a hobby. It is us young people who are deviating from our traditions and the only way to make young people fall in love with their culture again is to get them through social media,” said Zizipho, a second-year business management student at a college in Cape Town. Zizipho’s mother, Nosakhele, said she also loves tradition and her daughter learnt from her.  “She’s a curious person and has always loved learning since she was a young girl. I remember we had a traditional ritual called mvuma kufa (a ritual done before a person goes to thwasa) when she was only eight years old. “The ritual required a goat to drink some concoction and then I drink after it. When I was about to drink, Zizipho burst out and started questioning the elders why I was drinking a concoction after a goat. They had to take her away to allow the ritual to proceed because she kept on demanding answers,” said Nosakhele.  She said after the event she explained to Zizipho what was going on and from there she became obsessed with learning traditional things.
