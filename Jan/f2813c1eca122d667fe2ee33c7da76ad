ORLANDO Pirates defender Olisa Ndah says making his debut in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) with his national team, Nigeria, was a big deal for him. The 23-year-old became the second Pirates player to appear for his team at the Afcon, which is currently underway in Cameroon. Malawi international Gabadinho Mhango is another Pirates player at the Afcon, and he has done a sterling job helping his team reach the last-16 of the tournament. Mhango scored a necessary brace when they defeated Zimbabwe 2-1 early this week. Ndah got his chance for the Super Eagles during their 2-0 victory over Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday evening. Speaking exclusively to Orlandopiratesfc.com after the game, the player shared excitement about adding another international cap to his tally. “I feel very happy,” Ndah said. “I was really excited. It’s a very big deal for me. It’s always a big deal when a player represents their country. I’m so glad to have gotten this opportunity. Words cannot express how I feel.”
