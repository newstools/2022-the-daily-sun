VILLAGERS were over the moon when they got a sports complex five years ago. But their joy has now turned into anger. The Sekgopo Sports Complex in Ga-Sekgopo, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, is neglected and has become a white elephant. Residents said the sports complex was no longer being maintained by the Greater Letaba Municipality. and it was becoming very rundown. What angered them most was that they still had to pay to host football events. Sipho Moagi (36) said the municipality had failed them. “They are busy renovating toilets while the grass is brown. They even brought people from other areas to do the renovations while we have people in our village who can do it,” he said. “The municipality must not take us for granted. They must do the right thing.” The villagers said they didn’t understand why the municipality was still paying millions of rands to security companies to guard the complex. Thabo Molewa (29) said: “What are those security officers guarding there? There’s nothing worth looking after and nothing anyone can steal. “The municipality is just wasting money.” The municipality spent R20 million building the complex and according to resident Motsatsi Mohale (33), it was well maintained at the beginning. “The grass was green and everything was perfect. Things changed along the way and we don’t know what happened. “You can’t even book the place for an event due to the bad condition it’s in,” she said. Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Mainetje said the complex was not in use as maintenance work was underway. “There is a project busy with wall painting, carpentry, plumbing and more, hence the grass cutting and other general work is currently on hold. “The complex is not neglected and will never be. It is one of our assets as an institution for our community,” she said.
