A HUGE group of protesters and cops is gathered outside Cape Town Magistrates Court, as the man suspected of torching Parliament appears in court today, Tuesday 11 January. The group said they were there to support Zandile Christmas Mafe, whom they said was a homeless man being victimised for the failures of the state. Mongezi Ntaba (45), who was part of the crowd, said: “He is just a homeless man who happened to be at the wrong place at wrong time. We know the government is just using him as a cover-up for their failure to protect Parliament. We will be standing with him, we are Mafe and Mafe is us.” Some people gathered outside wearing Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) T-shirts said cops must not try to seem vigilant when they failed to protect Parliament from fire.  Delft PAC member Mzimasi Ndongeni said: “They were sleeping on duty but now they are here making noise for nothing. We are calling for the release of Mafe and government must now deal with real culprits. The actual person who burnt our Parliament is somewhere enjoying life while cops and courts are dealing with a wrong person.” Mafe appeared in court earlier today, where the state submitted an additional charge under the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorism and Related Activities Act.  The state also said that Mafe, who’s now represented by Advocate Dali Mpofu, should be taken for mental evaluation at a state institution for 30 days instead of being granted bail. This was opposed by his defence, who said he must be granted bail. Mpofu requested for an adjournment to allow him to speak to Mafe on the additional charge and the issue of mental evaluation raised by the state.  Mafe, who appeared with uncombed hair last week was sporting a new look. His hair and beard were shaved and he was wearing a black jacket. Just like he did previously, when he got inside the dock, Mafe turned around to allow himself to be photographed. The matter is still adjourned.
