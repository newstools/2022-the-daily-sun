PORTUGUESE national Jose Peseiro was announced as Nigeria’s new national football coach on Wednesday, but he will not be in charge at the Africa Cup of Nations tournament next month. Nigeria this month dismissed Germany’s Gernot Rohr just weeks ahead of the Cup of Nations, with technical director Augustine Eguavoen taking charge on an interim basis. “After careful consideration of a memo presented by chairman of the technical and development sub-committee, the executive committee endorsed a proposal for the appointment of Mr Jose Peseiro as the new head coach of the Super Eagles,” the Nigeria Football Federation said in a statement. The federation said the Cup of Nations, to be held in Cameroon between 9 January and 6 February, would allow Peseiro to establish a working relationship with Eguavoen, who will revert to his role as technical director after Africa’s premier soccer tournament.Peseiro coached Portuguese side Sporting Clube in 2018. – REUTERS
