A CRASH involving a Datsun Go and a minibus taxi has claimed four lives. The incident happened on Monday, at about 11.20am in Baden Powel Driver, Mitchells Plain in Cape Town. Western Cape police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said the circumstances surrounding the fatal vehicle accident are under investigation. “Four occupants of a Datsun Go, two men and two women died while a fifth passenger, a woman was transported to the hospital after the vehicle collided with a minibus taxi,” said Traut. Six occupants of the taxi were injured and were also transported to the hospital. It is believed that the Datsun Go was pursued by law enforcement officers following an accident at Mnandi beach. “During the pursuit, SAPS members also gave chase in an attempt to stop the driver who then lost control and collided with the taxi,” said Traut. Nolungisa Mtya (40) said the law enforcement officers, SAPS members and the Datsun Go driver were at fault. “I just feel for the families of the people who were in the taxi. The driver was selfish,” said Nolungisa.
