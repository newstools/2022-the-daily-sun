Three people have died and another seven have been injured
after a shooting in Durban. On Sunday, at around 16:00, police officers received a
report of a shooting at Bra Mbatha Lane in KwaMakhutha. When police arrived at the scene, they found three men, aged
between 24 and 28-years-old, with gunshot wounds. The men were part of a group
who were sitting under a tree, when an unknown vehicle drove by and the
occupants opened fire. "All three victims were rushed to a nearby clinic where
they succumbed to their injuries upon their arrival," said police
spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele. Another seven men were injured in the shooting. They were
all transported to hospital, said Mbele. "The motive for the attack is yet to be established as
investigations are ongoing. Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened
at KwaMakhutha SAPS for further investigation," she said. SOURCE: NEWS24
