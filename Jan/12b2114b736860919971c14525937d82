POLICE Minister Bheki Cele says the government cannot co-govern with thugs. He was speaking at the funeral service of Elukwatini station commander Colonel Beauty Marivate on Sunday, 9 January. Marivate was gunned down during a failed business robbery in the Mpumalanga town on 30 December. At least eight people have been arrested and are expected to appear in the Elukwatini Magistrates Court on Thursday, 13 January. Cele said the remaining suspects must be hunted down by the police because failure to do so would make it look as if thugs were co-governing the country. “We must respond decisively. Criminals must know that when they have killed police, they have started a war. Police must give them some run, they must not own this area,” he said. Cele was accompanied by his deputy Cassel Mathale, national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole, Mpumalanga community safety MEC Vusi Shongwe and provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela. Marivate’s daughter Tinswalo said she was a loving person. “Even when our mother faced death, she fought with all the fight she had in her. Not once did my mum cry and that will tell you how strong a woman she was,” she said. Meanwhile, Sergeant Khomotso Mashego (35), who died in a car accident after attending to the scene of Marivate’s murder, was also buried on Sunday. His funeral was held in Ga-Motibidi, near Bushbuckridge. Provincial deputy police commissioner Brigadier Botsotso Moukangwe described him as a hero and a brave cop. “All the suspects you are seeing on TV arrested for the killing of the colonel, it’s because of him. “Unfortunately, he was driving through Hazyview during heavy rain when his duty car collided with a truck, killing him instantly,” he said. Khomotso’s sister Angel (34) said he served the police department with pride. “He was a man of many characters. We have lost a pillar, a giant and a caring father,” she said.
