According to Mbuso, the purpose of the walk was to commemorate those who fought the colonial system. On Facebook, he posted: “What an honour. My brother Ndumiso Dlangalala heard that I’ll be walking from Ulundi to Isandlwana next month to remember those who fought the colonial system, and he decided to present me with an Adidas pair of sneakers so I can walk comfortably. I can’t wait.” ALSO READ : TREVOR NOAH BRINGS GIRLFRIEND HOME!
