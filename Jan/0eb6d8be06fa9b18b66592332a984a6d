A prisoner was killed
during a fight between inmates and prison officials at the Mthatha Correctional
Centre in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday. The incident took
place during an exercise session at around midday. Department of
Correctional Services (DCS) spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said the victim was
one of five offenders who allegedly launched an attack on four fellow inmates
and officials. "Unfortunately,
one inmate from the five attackers succumbed to his injuries during the
fracas," Nxumalo added. "One official and
another inmate remain in hospital due to the seriousness of the injuries
sustained. This is a disturbing incident as correctional centres had maintained
calm during the festive season." An internal
investigation has been launched. Nxumalo said the
police were also investigating the case. "The Judicial
Inspectorate for Correctional Services has also been informed and is expected
to run an independent investigation. The outcome of the inquiry will shed more
light on the motive and circumstances that may have triggered this incident. "DCS is
monitoring the situation. The facility will remain on high alert. " SOURCE: NEWS24
