THIS might be the year of reckoning for President Cyril Ramaphosa as the ANC prepares for its elective conference, where he’ll seek his second term. The year could define the factionalised ANC that has forever been preaching unity, but failed to achieve it since the defeat of former president Thabo Mbeki. It has been downhill since then, with loss of support at the polls at each election. Ramaphosa’s triumph at the Nasrec 54th national conference was hailed as a turning point for the ANC after nine years of former president Jacob Zuma’s reign. He was seen as the Messiah who’d pull the party from the abbyss. As a successful billionaire businessman, Ramaphosa was seen as incorruptible until allegations of his campaign being funded by businesspeople to the tune of R1 billion,which he’s denied. But he revealed his campaign was funded by private people, for R300 million. Five years later and funding allegations are still raging after bank accounts of his funding were sealed by a court of law. Ramaphosa will start all over again and it’s not yet clear who he will be up against. There has been a resurgence of Radical Economic Transformation, aka RET forces, at recent ANC regional conferences. These have been behind suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule to take on Ramaphosa at the December conference. But since Magashule has been frozen through the step-aside rule, it’s not clear who their horse is. The one clear thing is they’ve been winning regions so far in Eastern Cape and Limpopo, with some registered in KZN. So Ramaphosa starts his campaign for second term in somewhat hostile territory at the ANC January 8 celebrations in Limpopo, where RET forces have claimed victories. This will be a test for Ramaphosa in the province that warmly received him initially because of his Venda roots – until he pointed out he was actually born in Soweto. Ramaphosa’s road to seek a second term this year is going to be a long journey.
