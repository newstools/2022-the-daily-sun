Oriini Kaipara’s chin tattoo is called a moko kauae and is one traditionally worn by Maori women. A post shared by Oriini Kaipara (@oriinz)  The 37-year-old noted how it has been her lifelong dream to read primetime news sporting it. A post shared by Oriini Kaipara (@oriinz)  “I’m not speechless, but it’s a buzz. I am proud of how far I’ve come in being able to anchor 6pm right now. "It’s definitely a step forward, and a step-up. If there was a goal for me, it would be anchoring prime time news, and that’s happened.” Oriini told stuff.co.nz. A post shared by Oriini Kaipara (@oriinz)  " it’s breaking new ground for us as Maori, but also for people of colour. Whether you’ve got a moko kauae or not."
