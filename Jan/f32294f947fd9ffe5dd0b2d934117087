The period under review was marked by the unprecedented spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in both second and third waves in South Africa. As a business operating on the frontlines of the pandemic, the AVBOB Group experienced first-hand the bereavement of countless families and communities in the country. The challenges that South Africans have had to face and overcome since the outbreak of the pandemic reflect the breakneck speed at which the world has changed. These were the opening words of Chairman, Mr Jannie Venter, at AVBOB’s 70th AGM where the Society’s financial results for the 2021 financial year were presented. The event, which took place on 17 November 2021, was held with a limited number of in-person attendees at the ContinuitySA premises in Midrand, in adherence with current COVID-19 regulations, and online. “The 2021 financial year was unprecedented in many ways. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated regulatory responses created a volatile and rapidly evolving operating environment. Apart from the economic and environmental impacts, the loss of life has been devastating,” Venter said. During the past financial year AVBOB Funeral Service provided R497 million of free funeral service and products to their members, and R18 million of free personal protective equipment (PPE) used by their undertakers and frontline staff conducting funerals. The Group delivered exceptional results for the year under review, setting multiple records in all three operating units – insurance, funeral service and manufacturing. “We placed increased focus on our digital transformation journey and on employee wellness and support. The business is well-positioned for further growth in a new post-COVID-19 paradigm,” Venter said. Despite the strong investment market performance during the past year, volatility has increased, and future growth prospects appear to be under pressure. The effect of these economic pressures will be managed with empathy for members.        Media queries:   Tel: (012) 303 1010 Cell: 083 625 3971  Email: dmarius@avbob.co.za
