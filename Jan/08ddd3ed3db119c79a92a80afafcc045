VOLKSWAGEN Group South Africa (VWSA), which consists of Audi and Volkswagen, dominated Mzansi roads. The group ended last year with a combined market share of 22.3%, this means around one in every four passenger vehicles sold locally was either a Volkswagen or Audi model. VWSA chairman and managing director Robert Cisek said to end off last year as South Africa’s leading passenger car brand is truly an amazing achievement for VWSA. “2021 was a challenging year for our company and our industry due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global semi-conductor chip shortages. We are especially proud of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s 20.1% market share, which is the highest of all Volkswagen markets worldwide,” he said. In 2021, VWSA delivered 71 577 vehicles (Volkswagen Passenger Cars – 60 959, Audi – 5 712 and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles – 4 906) to customers in the local market – an increase of 8 095 cars compared to 2020. The performance of Volkswagen Passenger Cars was boosted by its strong dominance in the A0 segments. In the competitive A0 Hatch, A0 Sedan, and A0 SUV segments, Volkswagen was the undisputed leader. With 21 877 units sold last year, the Polo Vivo retained the title of South Africa’s most popular passenger car. The T-Cross finished 2021 with a total of 7 516 units sold. The local premium market faced severe challenges in 2021 due to a consumer buy-down trend; however, Audi remained one of the top three premium brands in South Africa. Audi achieved 18.4% share of the premium market and recorded 5 712 sales in 2021. The brand’s best-selling model range was the Audi Q3 with 900 vehicles sold last year. Eight new Audi and Volkswagen vehicles will be launched in the local market this year. The year 2022 will be an exciting year for Volkswagen Passenger Cars, which will see the introduction of four new vehicles. These include the all-new Golf 8 R, high-performance Tiguan R, Taigo, which is a compact SUV, as well as Volkswagen’s only sedan derivative, the Polo Sedan. The best-selling Polo will receive a facelift in the first quarter of the year and so will the Tiguan Allspace and the sporty T-Roc in the second half of the year.
