A man has
pleaded guilty to more than 280 counts of fraud after he used cloned credit
cards as payments at various shops around the Western Cape. This comes
after the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime team in Cape Town took over cases
related to a possible credit card cloning syndicate operating in the Western
Cape. Two men were arrested for a crime spree that took place in 2018. Siyasanga
Miya, 39, was sentenced to 13 years on 280 counts of fraud. Six years of his
sentence was suspended for five years on the condition that he is not convicted
of fraud and theft during that period, said Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani. "He
was further ordered to serve a concurrent five years, of which is wholly
suspended for five years, on 34 counts of contravening the Electronic
Communications Act," said Hani. Co-accused
Simphiwe Bulana faced 95 counts of fraud, and was sentenced to five years,
wholly suspended for five years, and 24 months correctional supervision.
Furthermore, he was sentenced to five years, suspended for five years, on 18
counts of contravening the Electronic Communications Act. Prior to
the arrest of Miya, he was awaiting trial on another matter with Bulana. "The
court has taken into consideration that Miya has been in custody since his
arrest in 2020, meaning he is to effectively serve the remaining five years'
imprisonment. Additionally, both accused were declared unfit to possess a
firearm," said Hani. SOURCE:
