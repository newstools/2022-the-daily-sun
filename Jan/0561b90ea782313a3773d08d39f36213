 EFF MP
Naledi Chirwa has come under fire and divided Twitter after calling President
Cyril Ramaphosa a weak little boy. Chirwa, one
of the youngest members of Parliament was responding to the President’s tweet
about the need to protect the Constitution and Democratic State. Chirwa
tweeted: “You're such a weak little boy. All your fellow stooges u sent to
collapse Lindiwe were collapsed themselves. It won't be surprising if u do what
little boys do when overpowered by women. Throw the tantrum we are expecting
it. You'll forever remain a toothless boy. Mfana ke mfana.”   You're such a weak little boy. All your fellow stooges u sent to collapse Lindiwe were collapsed themselves. It won't be surprising if u do what little boys do when overpowered by women. Throw the tantrum we are expecting it. You'll forever remain a toothless boy. Mfana ke mfana. https://t.co/rmooatRufu   Sdima tweeted: “We should not stoop to such language. I don't like Ramaphosa and his politics. That language is disrespectful. That's your colleague and leader. uMongameli." Kgaugelo Moraka said: “The language is unfortunate. You are way better than this. Way better.” Rupert’sPudgyLetfTit said, “To all those outraged by Naledi’s tweet I need to understand if you were as outraged when a man from Stellenbosch called the President and his cabinet dom kops. Would you be less outraged if she replaced the offending word with domkop? Introspect.” Casanova said: “You were too quiet on the Bushiri issue cause you and him come from the same country now you're disrespecting our president ?? wa tella wena.” Lesilo Rula tweeted: “Y’all telling Naledi Chirwa to “respect her elders” the elder in question? None of those kleptomaniac ANC officials deserve our respect. They don’t respect us, our livelihoods, health, safety, or intelligence so why should we respect them?”
