WITH holidaymakers coming back to Gauteng, police made sure no one was coming back with illegal goods or firearms. On Friday afternoon, 7 January, dozens of law enforcement agency officials conducted a roadblock on the N3 as part of Operation O Kae Molao. Police, Gauteng traffic cops and South African Revenue Service officials conducted the operation. Police spokeswoman Constable Doris Nkosi said the operation was a success. Motorist Sizakele Zwane (34) said the operation was necessary. “We are safer from all the thuggery as police are visible now,” said Sizakele.
