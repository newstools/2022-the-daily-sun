SEEING pupils go to school without proper uniforms did not sit well with Kgothatso Mafa. So, the 20-year-old second-year chemical engineering student from Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo started a campaign asking businesspeople, partners and residents to donate school uniform for poor pupils. Kgothatso realised pupils might drop out or be made fun of for not having proper uniform. “Going to school without proper school uniform can break a pupil’s confidence, especially torn shoes. Despite being ashamed of their torn uniform, it is worse going to school barefoot. ALSO READ | SUNPOWER
TO GRAVE MIX-UP RESCUE! “Imagine smart pupil whose grades are affected all because of torn shoes,” she said. Kgothatso told Daily Sun she aimed to raise 260 pairs of school shoes before March for needy pupils across all schools in Ga-Sekgopo. “The shoes or uniform don’t need to be new, as long as they are proper for a pupil to wear. I’m also going to look for stationery and sanitary towels.” ALSO READ | MANHUNT
FOR SLOVO THUGS! Her goal is to never see pupils suffer and fail to go to school because of their poor background. “It is tough for parents to provide for their children’s educational needs as most of them no longer work. I’m trying to close that gap,” she said. Kgothatso plans to grow her campaign to offer scholarships and bursaries to deserving pupils. Her cousin Junior Mkansi (22) supports her project. “A lot of poor pupils will benefit. This will help them stay in school and study,” said Junior.
