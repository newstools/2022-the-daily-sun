AMAZULU boss Sandile Zungu has assured coach Benni McCarthy he will be backed in the January transfer window. Zungu said they have done the hard work, as they have identified players who will be confirmed once the window is open next week. Usuthu are set to complete the signing of Uruguayan striker Facundo Juarez, having missed out on him during the off season. Juarez plays for Club Atletico Mitre de Santiago Del Estero in Argentina. AmaZulu are set to sign him for free as his contract will expire on Friday. McCarthy has told the club he needs new blood to bolster his squad in January. McCarthy lamented he wanted to add more players during the off season, but he was not wholly satisfied with the signings he got, considering that they will be competing in the Caf Champions League. The ambitious McCarthy wants to challenge Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns in the January transfer market. The Durban club last won a major trophy in 1992. “I can assure you in January we will be announcing new faces to our team to strengthen a strong squad that will lead us to better performances in the Champions League,” said Zungu. Usuthu are in a tough Champions League Group B with Raja Casablanca (Morocco), Horoya (Guinea) and ES Setif of Algeria. McCarthy stated a few weeks ago his current squad will not be able to go toe to toe with the top sides on the continent. Said Zungu: “We are in the group stages and that means there are six matches before the quarterfinals, so we have to tighten our squad.”
