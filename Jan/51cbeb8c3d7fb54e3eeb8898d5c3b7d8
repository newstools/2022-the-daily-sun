THE Pretoria Magistrates’ Court has sentenced Phenis Mzimba (24) to life imprisonment for murder and robbery. Mzimba was convicted and sentenced for the murder of Peter Thobela. According to Colonel Dimakatso Sello, on 3 September 2019, Thobela gave Mzimba a lift on the N4 in Bronkhorstspruit. He was accompanied by two other men. “The trio hijacked Thobela before shooting him and leaving his body in a ditch, where it was discovered by community members. “The vehicle was recovered in Emalahleni and through the assistance of the public, Mzimba was traced and arrested for murder and hijacking,” Sello said in a statement. She added that the case was investigated by Sergeant Dennis Tshepo Mahlangu, attached to trio crimes from Tshwane District. “The court found Mzimba guilty of robbery with aggravating circumstances and murder. He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for robbery and life sentence for murder. The sentences will run concurrently,” Sello added. She urged public members to be vigilant at all times and not give lifts to strangers as by doing so, they could be putting their lives in danger.
