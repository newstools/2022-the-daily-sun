ZAMBIAN referee, Janny
Sikazwe, stole the show when Mali beat Tunisia in their Afcon Group F encounter
at the 20 000-seater Limbe Stadium on WEdnesday afternoon. Sikazwe blew the whistle some
nine second before the actual regulation time of 90 minutes and didn’t allow
for any additional time, an act that sparked an uproar from the Tunisian bench. In fact, with VAR available
as option for him, but Sikazwe failed to utilise the assistance of the video
technology but pointed to the spot in the 48th minute to give a soft penalty. Ibrahima Kone stepped forward
to successfully convert from a spot-kick. From there onwards, the
Carthage Eagles pushed forward for an equaliser, and their efforts ultimately
paid off in the 75th minute, being awarded a penalty, which was confirmed by
VAR. Wahbi Khazri stood up, taking
the responsibility, but his effort was denied by Mali goalkeeper Ibrahim
Mounkoro, pulling a wonderful save to protect their lead. Tunisia came into the
tournament in Cameroon following one of the most dominant qualifying runs in
history, where they topped Group A with a healthy seven-points over runners-up
Equatorial Guinea after claiming five wins from six games. They also scored the
second-most goals with 14. Led by the experienced
manager Mondher Kbaier, Tunisia were looking to quickly move on from the Arab
Cup disappointment where they lost in the final, 2-0 to reigning African
champions Algeria last month.
