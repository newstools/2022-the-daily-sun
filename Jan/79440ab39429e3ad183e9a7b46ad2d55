PROTEAS batter Keegan Petersen has credited his father, Dirkie, for helping develop him into the batsman he is today. The 28-year-old caught the eye with a stellar performance with the willow in South Africa’s first innings. Petersen scored a career-best 62 before he was dismissed by player of the match candidate Shardul Thakur at the Wanderers. Petersen’s impressive batting technique was the talk of the town with many predicting a bright future for the stylish right-hander in the format. And speaking after his impressive knock, Petersen gave credit to his father, a former cricketer himself, for helping polish his skills from a young age. “My technique, I don’t know where it comes from, but I think it comes naturally,” said Petersen. “I have just batted the same way since I was a kid and that’s all. Thanks to my dad because he is the only guy I have been working with all my life. I always tell everyone that he probably knows my technique and my game better than I do.” Petersen grew up looking up to his father who played for the Western Province B and Paarl Cricket Club in the latter stages of his career. Dirkie was an outstanding all-rounder in the 80s and 90s and played with the likes of Shukri Conrad and Marais Erasmus, who is umpiring in this match. “He (Dirk) played cricket back in the day a little bit, but I don’t know the complete history of it. I was a kid back then when he was at the back end of his career playing club cricket,’ added Petersen. “That is where I always dragged along to club games, and I fell in love with the game from that time. If you can ask the people that know me from back home, they used to see my dad throwing thousands of balls to me in the nets all the time and that’s where I learnt my trade.” Meanwhile, the Proteas are chasing 240 runs to win the second Test and level the series at one-all.
