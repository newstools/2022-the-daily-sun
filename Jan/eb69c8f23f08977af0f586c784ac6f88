KHENSANI Baloyi said her mum must be smiling from her grave as she fulfilled her wish of passing matric with flying colours. The 18-year-old from Tambo Village in Hammanskraal, Tshwane matriculated from Sikhululekile High with seven distinctions. She’s also the top pupil in Gauteng who got full marks for business studies. Khensani told Daily Sun she wished her mum was still alive to share this achievement.“I was struggling emotionally for a long time because my mum and I used to study together. She always told me I will one day make my family proud and I believe this is what she was referring to,” she said. Khensani, who is going to study BCom at Wits University, said she used old question papers to study and spent sleepless nights studying for the final exams. She advised the class of 2022 to use whatever resources they have to study hard. Her sister Martha Mabolola (32) said they were proud of what she has achieved. “My mum encouraged all her children to be focused and would emphasise we should give my younger sister all the support she needs to pass matric. She used to tell us my sister had the potential to be successful and we should support her at all times. “My mum died in November 2020 during the exams and we thought she wouldn’t make it, but she instead used her books to deal with her loss,” she said. Bishop Zebulon Nkwana of House of Prayer Church said he knew the difficulties Khensani went through after her mum, Pastor Mary Baloi died. “We are so proud of this girl because she was able to perform outstandingly even in tough times,” he said.
