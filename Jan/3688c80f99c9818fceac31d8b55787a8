Minister Bheki Cele honoured the women in blue during the commemoration of the
annual National Police Day on Thursday, 27 January. It was held
at the South African Police Service’s Tshwane Academy. “Wa thinta
abafazi, uzofa finish!” he said. Cele said
the day was meant to commemorate the contribution of women in policing, to
celebrate those who serve the nation with integrity and pride, and to pay
homage to those who have fallen. “We salute
those women trailblazers who, against all odds, demonstrated that women are
more than up to the task to lead with integrity and excellence. Thank you
maphoyisa for delivering a safer festive season and managing to keep crime at
manageable levels,” said Cele. Among
others, the minister appreciated Sergeant Catherine Tladi, who is deemed as
having a passion for solving crimes affecting women and children. “She has
flown the country’s flag high through her investigation work that resulted in
five life sentences and 1 088 years’ imprisonment imposed on the convicted
Pretoria serial rapist,” he said. Cele said
there were many more officers who had taken up the call to improve their
service to victims of gender-based violence and went beyond the call of duty to
ensure justice was served. “It has not
been easy for women to make their mark in previously male-dominated units
within the organisation but I’m happy that this organisation values the
importance of gender equality by increasing the number of female officers. Let
us focus our energies on what needs to be done to create a safer environment
for all people in South Africa, especially women and children,” said Cele. Police
commissioner General Khehla Sitole said the celebration was about the women in
blue and that the number of women in the organisation was increasing.
