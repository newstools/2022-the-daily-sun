PROMINENT South African road runner, Irvette Van Zyl, is determined to break her 50km ultra-marathon world record. Last year, the mother of two boys smashed the women’s 50km world record during the Nedbank Runified race in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape. The three-time Soweto marathon champion took three minutes off Briton Aly Dixon’s time, stopping the clock at 3:04:23. The 34-year-old runner, who is married to retired 400m hurdler LJ Van Zyl, made her country proud. She received R100 000 for crossing the finish line first and a whopping R150 000 for breaking the world record. The race returns bigger and better at the Nelson Mandela Bay on 6 March in Gqeberha, with a star-studded line-up. It is open to 35-to-65 age groups in both the men’s and women’s races. “I am healthy and training to prepare for my first race of the year. I battled with a headache and did not train for a few days, but it’s gone now. The feeling of breaking the world record will only sink in if I break it for the second time. I am confident and ready to do it again,” Van Zyl told SunSport. But the two-time Olympian said breaking the record would depend on the weather and how she felt on the day of the race. “The plan is to run my race and do my best. It’s a big race, and I am not worried about the competition on the day. If I can have a pacesetter on the day, it will help me a lot,” she said. The two-time Spar Grand Prix champion said she would plan for her year after the 50km run. “It’s good that races are opening up again. But I do not want to compete a lot. I will do the Two Oceans marathon in March, Spar Ladies, and the Soweto marathon,” she added. The registrations for the eagerly awaited race will not surpass 200 runners, and the organisers urged elite runners to submit their entries to avoid disappointment. Race director and the Nedbank Running Club manager, Nick Bester, told runners that entries would sell on a first-come, first-serve basis.
