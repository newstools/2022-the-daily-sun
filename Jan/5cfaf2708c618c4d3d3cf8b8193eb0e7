WHEN Johannes Nokeri was sentenced to five life terms for rape, his victims finally felt relief. This came after he was found guilty of 18 counts of rape, 23 counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, theft of a motor vehicle and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. The 33-year-old showed no remorse when he was sentenced in the North West High Court sitting in Moretele Magistrates Court on Friday, 14 January. The court heard how Nokeri targeted women travelling from taverns in Hammanskraal at night between 2012 and 2017. A 37-year-old victim, who was 31 when she was attacked, said telling her story was still traumatising. “I was five months pregnant and didn’t have the power to fight back. “He covered my face and pointed a gun at me. I’m relieved after the sentencing but the pain won’t go away,” she said. A 36-year-old victim, who was 32 when she was raped, said Nokeri pounced while she was waiting for a bus to work. “I woke up near Babelegi industrial area after being hit on the head with a gun. It’s difficult for me to speak about this because I am trying to move on.” Nokeri was bust in 2017 in possession of a stolen vehicle, found by a tracking company. Six rounds of ammunition were also in his possession. He had two previous convictions for rape and robbery. Judge Maleshane Kgoele described Nokeri as a person with no respect for women. She said the court had a responsibility to protect communities against people like Nokeri and said the sentence was a way to send a strong message. “Nokeri started his manhood on the wrong foot. At 22, he already had a conviction,” she said. “This clearly shows the chances of him being rehabilitated are zero.” Acting director of public prosecution for North West, Rachel Makhari-Sekhaolelo welcomed the conviction. Provincial National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Henry Mamothame said although Nokeri was granted leave to appeal, they would oppose it.
