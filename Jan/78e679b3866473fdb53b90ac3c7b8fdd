The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) is probing Cape Town police after a man allegedly swallowed a white powder. The 40-year-old man was later declared dead on the scene. The deceased was identified as a Constantia resident. IPID spokesperson Grace Langa said the officers claimed that, after cornering the man, he swallowed the white powder. It is alleged that, on Friday at about 16:30, Piketberg police officers spotted a vehicle, which had been reported missing in Kirstenhof, Cape Town. "When officers approached the bakkie, the driver sped off. Police attempted to stop him, and he ignored them. He drove even faster. "He was chased along the N7. The bakkie was driving recklessly and even faced oncoming traffic. More officers were called for back-up," said Langa. The Cape Town flying Squad responded and also gave chase. "The driver (again) refused to stop. Officers fired shots at the wheels of the vehicle to stop the car. The chase continued towards Cape Town (CBD), where the driver was forced to a halt as the car was driving on rims. "Police approached the driver. They noticed that the man held about seven small containers, containing a white powder, as they opened the door. He swallowed the white substance," Langa said. The man was pulled out of the car, ordered to lie on the ground, and tied with cable ties. "... a white foam came out of his mouth. He was also bleeding through his nose. Paramedics were called to the scene. They tried resuscitating him. "They later declared him dead on the scene. There were no visible injuries on his body. IPID is investigating an inquest docket," Langa said.
