WESTERN Cape Premier Alan Winde has suspended Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz with immediate effect. A source told the SunTeam this was due to sexual harassment allegations. “It has to do with unwelcome sexual advances he allegedly made to the ladies who work at his office. It’s not clear what exactly happened but his troubles are coming straight from his office,” said the source. On Sunday, 23 January, Winde said the suspension was based on serious allegations of misconduct. Provincial legislature opposition members called on Winde to be clear on the reasons. GOOD party general secretary Brett Herron said the public had a right to know. “The premier owes it to the people of the Western Cape to explain the announcement and to provide some basis for the suspension. The premier should clarify whether the allegations relate to Fritz’s conduct in government matters or outside and of a personal nature.” ANC leader Cameron Dugmore echoed those statements. “No reasons have been given for this extraordinary measure. We demand a full and immediate explanation of allegations against MEC Fritz.”
