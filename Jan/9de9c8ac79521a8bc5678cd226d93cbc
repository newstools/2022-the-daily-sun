WHENEVER rain clouds gather, these residents become terrified their homes will be swallowed by sinkholes. For over three years, the people of Khutsong in Carletonville, Gauteng, have been begging the municipality to help them with no luck. Speaking to Daily Sun, gogo Mamokete Malebo (75) said her 12-roomed house was covered in cracks and she had to beg neighbours for a place to sleep because it was no longer safe. “When we bought houses here, we had no idea we would end up dealing with a problem like this,” she said. Gogo Mamokete said she was at home during the day but slept at friends’ houses at night. “It pains me to watch my house collapse before my eyes. Some of the furniture is getting stolen because no one is home at night.” She said the municipality offered affected residents RDPs but it was not a solution. “Not even half of my belongings would fit into an RDP. It’s not our fault that land surveyors hired by the municipality couldn’t tell they were building on wet land. We need fair compensation,” she said. The municipality revealed that 70% of the land in Khutsng was not suitable for people to live on and 25 000 families had to be relocated. Only 200 were moved to RDPs last year. “Since 2016, the situation has drastically deteriorated. New sinkholes formed at several locations in old Khutsong, which severely damaged internal water supply pipes and sewer pipe networks,” said the municipality. Merafong Mayor Sello Mogomotsi previously told Daily Sun the municipality was negotiating with families who didn’t want to move. “It’s difficult to convince them to move to RDPs. People are attached to their homes and moving is a huge task,” he said.
