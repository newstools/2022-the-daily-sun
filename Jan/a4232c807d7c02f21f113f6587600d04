Mpumalanga
police are searching for the perpetrators of an attempted hijacking, who shot
at two children and their mother near Kruger National Park on Monday. One of
the children was wounded. According
to police spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, the family left the game
reserve and the 40-year-old mother drove close to a taxi rank in Mganduzweni
Trust, White River. "[The]
woman was driving in her white Hyundai vehicle with her two children when two
armed men attacked them. The suspects fired some shots at them, injuring a
girl. It is said that the woman then drove off and stopped [somewhere] where
she got assistance from a member of the public," Mohlala added. The girl
was taken to hospital for treatment and the police were alerted. Police
could not provide the ages of the children. In a
statement, the South African National Parks (SANParks) said the family had been
travelling along the R538, near the park's Numbi Gate. "This
regrettable incident involves a family that brought much-needed tourism revenue
to the Mpumalanga province," acting SANParks CEO Dumisani Dlamini said. He advised
visitors to be extra vigilant when travelling through crime hotspots outside
the national park because the risk of opportunistic crime was higher there. "We
have communicated with our colleagues in the provincial security cluster to
secure all routes leading to the Kruger [National Park] through regular patrols
and visible policing. The South African Police Service (SAPS) has launched a
manhunt for the perpetrators. We urge responsible community members to be
active in protecting tourists visiting the province as tourism is key to
boosting rural economic activity," Dlamini said. Mohlala
added that anyone who has information on the whereabouts of the suspects should
contact Detective Warrant Officer David Hlatswayo on 072 233 7530.
