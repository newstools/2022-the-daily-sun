GRAVEYARDS are sacred places and should be respected. But mourners in Tweefontein, Mpumalanga, are forced to hide behind tombstones to relieve themselves when nature calls during funerals. This is because the graveyard does not have toilets. Residents now want the municipality to build them. Madala Geelbooi Sibanyoni (68) said it was a shame to see mourners hiding behind tombstones and the grass. “There is no respect and privacy at our graveside. What we see during funerals is a big shame. Male mourners just stand behind tombstones and pee on them. Women do the same and hide behind the tall grass. The only way to fix the problem is to build toilets at the graveyard. “Families who have graves here should clean them so no one hides in the grass. People no longer have respect for the dead.” Meshack Mahlangu (67) told Daily Sun that he once pitched the idea to clean the graveside to the municipality, but it was ignored. “This should not be happening during funerals, but at the same time you can’t blame people. There are no toilets. Even grave diggers have nowhere to go when nature calls. They just pee on graves. We have been crying for toilets for a long time but nothing has happened,” he said. Residents said if the municipality did not hear their cries, they would build them themselves as they could not watch the dead being disrespected. Sangoma Mehlwemamba Sikhosana said urinating on a grave was a sign of disrespect to the dead. “People must respect the dead as much as they respect the living. We still believe in, and talk to them even if they are no longer with us,” he said. Thembisile Hani Local Municipality spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane-Mokako said they would consider the issue of toilets in their next budget. “We have built toilets in other graveyards but some still have no toilets. “The other problem is that people vandalise them, and then they need to be fixed,” she said.
