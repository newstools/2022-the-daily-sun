THE Vrede Dairy Project was finally handed over to 65 beneficiaries on Friday, 14 January. The handover was in line with Public Prosecutor Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s recommendations in December 2020, after an investigation into allegations of maladministration in 2017 and 2018. The project in the Free State town, which was also investigated by the Zondo Commission, was started in 2013 as a partnership with Gupta-linked company Estina and was used to channel millions of rands into the controversial family’s pockets. The initial plan was for Estina and the agriculture department to invest R500 million into the project. As part of the project, black farmers were promised five cows each. In August 2014, the Estina contract was cancelled but it emerged at the Zondo Commission that between December 2014 and May 2016, Estina received further payments of R130 million.  Mkhwebane welcomed the handover of the project. “We are pleased our investigations continue to be of value to society and, in particular, grassroots communities,” she said . She congratulated the beneficiaries and urged them to make the most of the opportunity, saying it would go a long way towards tackling unemployment, poverty and hunger in the province. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela led the handover ceremony. She said the day reminded her of June 1955, when 3 000 people gathered in Kliptown to adopt the Freedom Charter. She said the struggle for land and resources was continuing. “What our government is doing today is indeed a step in the right direction,” she said. Ntombela said the 65 beneficiaries were the owners of 51% of the project, while the remaining 49% was open to partners to ensure its long-term success.
