CAMEROON captain Vincent Aboubakar continued with his fine form in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) when he scored another brace in their 4-1 win over Ethiopia last night to propel the hosts into the last-16 of the tournament. Aboubakar was the hero on the opening day, netting two late first-half penalties as the Indomitable Lions – who won the last of their five titles in 2017 - came from behind to beat Burkina Faso 2-1. It was almost a similar scenario yesterday at Olembe Stadium in Yaounde, Cameroon, as Ethiopia were the first to find the back of the net just under five minutes through Dawa Hotessa. However, Ethiopia’s lead was short-lived as Karl Toko Ekambi levelled the matters with a fine header in the eighth minute of the match. It was an exciting clash between the two nations as Ethiopia showed no respect to the host nation, piling pressure throughout the first half. They went to the break tied on 1-1. Cameroon flexed their muscle in the second half and took the lead in the 53rd minute through captain Aboubakar. The 29-year-old completed his brace two minutes later to make it 3-1. In the 63rd minute, Ekambi also scored his second of the match to make it 4-1, ensuring they qualify for the last-16. The defeat means it is the end of the road for Ethiopia, who have now lost two matches in Group A. Ethiopia, the first team to arrive in Cameroon, will play their last group match on Monday and be the first team to go back home.
