Dear MizzBMY girlfriend is acting strange lately. W e’ve been dating for a year and she never wanted me to visit her, but always comes to my place  .  Would I be wrong to ambush her and find out what she is hiding? Dear BroOpenness and honesty is needed in every relationship. I believe that there are many reasons your girlfriend has that don't allow you to visit her place. Regardless of what her reasons might be, she needs to be honest with you. Be careful of ambushing her as you don’t know what dangerous situation you might find yourself walking into. Insist on her telling you the truth so that you can both reach an understanding. Good luck!
