  "Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has noted a media report which is nothing but a desperate propaganda aimed at tarnishing her name," read the statement issued by her communications team on Friday. The statement comes after the Daily Maverick on Thursday published an article titled "Lindiwe Sisulu met Gupta-linked Salim Essa’s banking buddy in December Dubai visit".   The article stated that Sisulu had visited the Dubai Expo in December last year and met with four leading business people, including Hamza Farooqui, Salim Essa’s erstwhile business partner.   Sisulu's office accused the media of being on a fishing expedition for nefarious reasons.   "The pictures they have been using as those of a Gupta ally are unfortunately of a member of the Royal family and CEO of Emirates airline.  Speaking to New24, Sisulu’s spokesperson Steve Motale said Sisulu wanted to set record straight after attempts were made to distort what had happened during the minister’s official visit to Dubai. “Since this was an international event, Minister Sisulu met many people. This allegation about a Gupta ally is just part of a sponsored smear campaign that will not succeed." Sisulu also took the opportunity to reiterate that she had an impeccable track record of fighting corruption and that no amount of "propaganda" would erase this. This debacle comes following weeks of controversy after Sisulu attacked the judiciary.  News24
