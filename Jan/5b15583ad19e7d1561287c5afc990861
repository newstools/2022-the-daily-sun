HE HELPED a passerby catch a pig and his family believes he paid for his good deed with his life. The family of Patrick Mkhabela suspects he was killed by the animal’s owner, who believed he was trying to steal it. The 51-year-old from Phomolong section, near Hammanskraal in Tshwane, died when his shack went up in flames on Christmas Day. His body was found after neighbours noticed flames coming from the shack. His niece, Tebogo Seshabela (35), said she heard from neighbours that he helped people catch a pig that was roaming the streets, only to realise he was helping them steal the animal, which was later slaughtered. She said neighbours told her he tried to explain to the pig’s owner that he had only helped catch it. However, the owner didn’t believe him. Later that same day, his shack suddenly caught fire. “My uncle was not a thief. He was loved by his neighbours and made money fixing bicycles,” she said. Neighbour Mariah Maluleke (33) said she was woken by smoke at about midnight and when she checked through her window, she saw huge flames coming off Patrick’s shack. “We had to use buckets and rain water from the streets to put out the fire. “When the firefighters arrived, it was already too late. What happened is very sad. He was a good person who never bothered anyone,” she said. Community leader Kgomotso Ramasodi said the residents told her about the incident and they needed donations to bury Patrick. Sergeant Herman Moremi of Temba cop shop said an inquest docket was opened.
