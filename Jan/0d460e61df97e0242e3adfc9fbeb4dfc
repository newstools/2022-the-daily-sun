AMERICAN singer India Arie is singing Lloyiso Gijana’s praises. She recently shared a video of herself complementing the Mzansi-born musician on how much of a good singer he is. In the video, which has been widely shared on social media, India can be heard saying Loyiso has soul. “He sings with so much heart and depth that it is striking because a lot of people can sing notes, but it is a more rare thing to see people go to this place when they sing. “I was watching a bunch of his videos the other day and I was impressed and I sent him a message the other day and he hasn’t responded and if he is seeing this video, I am waiting for your reply,” she can be heard saying.

Late last year he was signed to Republic Records and took to social media to share the good news. “This is such surreal moment. As a boy growing up, I used to perform to a fake crowd at the back of my house. Now it’s all coming to life. To think I wanted to quit but I didn’t and with the support of my family and friends I can proudly say mama we made it, we are global. I’m excited to create magic with the @republicrecords and @umgsa family and want to thank @ambitiouz_entertainment for all support they’ve given me,” he said. A post shared by indiaarie (@indiaarie)
