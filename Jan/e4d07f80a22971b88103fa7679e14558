AWARD-WINNING music producer Dlala Thukzin will be giving a lucky fan the means to get a driver’s licence in every month of 2022. The gqom sensation, whose real name is Thuthuka Zindlovu, said he would be contributing R6 000 towards the process for each winner, in partnership with Wine Wednesdays, as he knew the importance of having a licence. “We’ll give winners the money to book for the learner’s licence, driving lessons and then book the driver’s licence test,” he said. “Right now, people are crying for jobs and there are small things that make people lose out on jobs,” he said.
