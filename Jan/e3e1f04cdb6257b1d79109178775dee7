On Sunday, 26 December, the Arch passed on at the age of 90. Since Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s passing, there are those who have accused him of being a sell-out. They use the case of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as an example. She appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which the Arch was chair. He asked Madikizela-Mandela to apologise for the death of 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, who was killed in her home. That did not sit well with Winnie’s supporters. Hence, the accusation. The legacy of great leaders is always contested when they have passed on. When Nelson Mandela passed on, there were those who accused him of being a sell-out. Was he? Not at all. Instead, he was a world class leader and appreciated by many. But people hold different views about leaders. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that Tutu is also accused of being a sell-out. The truth is: he was a hero and great leader. No amount of vilification will erase that.
