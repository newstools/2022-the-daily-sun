MZANSI is disappointed after learning that Grammy-winning rapper Drake is not coming to the country. This is after they were fooled by a fake Konka Facebook account, claiming the nightclub is bringing the rapper to Soweto. The page uses Konka’s name and has over 70 000 followers and the post about Drake had 16 000 reactions and over 6 000 comments. The page started posting about Drake on Monday, 24 January and said the rapper would come soon. “We are bringing Drake to Konka soon,” the post said. Then a follow-up post said it was confirmed the rapper was coming, and entry would start from R20 000. ALSO READ : SINGER RETHABILE IS ENGAGED! “It is official and confirmed Mzansi!! Drake is coming to Konka. Date: 10 March 2022. Entry: R20 000 per person. VIP: R30 000. It’s gonna be a lifetime experience.” However, the real Konka account quickly stopped the excitement and said the post was a scam. “Scam Alert!! Fake News!! Mara one day is one day,” they wrote. Twitter user @ReighNay commented: “I was ready to sell my heart. Be ndizo phefumla ngenxeba.” Another user Moshapo R said they wanted Drake. “We don’t need one day is one day, we need Drake,” he wrote. Others suggested that Konka should bring him for real and they would attend. Scram Alert !! ?? Fake News ?? Mara one day is one day ?????? pic.twitter.com/VZHEvREk3h
