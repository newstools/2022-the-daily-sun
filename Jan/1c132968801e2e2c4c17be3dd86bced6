LINDAH Majola’s opened up about the pressures he faces as a gay man. The 25-year-old actor, who plays Langa on Showmax’s hit series The Wife, recently shared a video on social media in which he can be seen crying and saying he was just gay and not a god, so people shouldn’t expect him to be perfect. Before landing the role of Langa, he made funny videos on social media and ran a food truck. He told Daily Sun: “The video was inspired by my need to transform my pain into something creative. I am continuously trying to fill gaps in me with affirmations of love and self-acceptance.” Lindah from Bonela in Durban, KZN, said growing up as a gay person, he had to fight to be recognised. “I felt the need to overcompensate, do better, be better. My entire life felt like I had to prove I had a right to exist. I needed approval, which I never received, and it made me believe I was never enough. “Being in the public eye has made me more vulnerable.

I have used that noise to confront my insecurities and understand I’m imperfect. I’ll never be perfect, but I can still be a positive contributor to society.” However, he said he’s learnt to be more open and not to let bad comments get to him. “As humans, we’re under a microscope. Someone out there is always observing and scrutinising what we do but the difference with me is the scale is a tad bigger,” he said. “I surround myself with people who ground me. Even if we have different views, we respect each other,” said Lindah.
