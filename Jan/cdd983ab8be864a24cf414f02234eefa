An Absa employee who allegedly defrauded the bank to the
tune of R103 million will appear in the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial
Crimes Court on Thursday. The police's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation
(Hawks) arrested Xolela Masebeni, a specialist engineer who worked in Sandton,
for allegedly stealing R103 million from the bank. He allegedly transferred the
money into six different bank accounts over four months between September and
December 2021. Masebeni was arrested in Queenstown in the Eastern Cape last
week. Hawks spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mulamu said Absa reported the
matter to the authorities following an internal investigation. After the law
enforcement unit arrested Masebeni, he appeared in the Komani Magistrate's
Court in Queenstown, where he was remanded in custody pending further
investigation. The Hawks said they have not ruled out more arrests on this
matter or bringing additional charges against Masebeni. "The matter was transferred to the Palm Ridge
Specialised Commercial Crimes Court and is expected to be in court on 27
January for a legal representative and bail application, " said Mulamu.
