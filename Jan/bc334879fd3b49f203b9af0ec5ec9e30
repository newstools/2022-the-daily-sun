SAMKELISO “Sam Sam” Thubane is fast becoming known as one of Mzansi’s best stunt drivers. The 24-year-old from Mahushu, outside Hazyview in Mpumalanga, said he realised he had talent in 2010. “I started spinning cars in 2010 at the age of 12. I was inspired by legends such as Nicholas Moosa from Barberton and Jeff James from Soweto. Mandla Nikiwe from Mkhuhlu trained me to perform stunts,” he said. Samkeliso said his manager Laundrick Ground helped him win spinning tournaments across Mzansi and abroad.  In 2016, he won first prize in the So You Think You Can Spin competition. In 2021, he was crowned champion in the Redbull Shayi’Moto Competition, which was broadcast worldwide on Redbull TV.  “Spinning has been associated with criminality but over the past 10 years, we have managed to turn this into a sport that is enjoyed by young and old. My dream for this sport is obviously for the government to give it some funding because it’s the fastest-growing motorsport in South Africa,” he said. Samkeliso said sometimes it was a challenge to balance his studies with travelling to spinning events.
