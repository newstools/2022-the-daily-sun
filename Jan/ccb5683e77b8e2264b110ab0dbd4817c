RESIDENTS of Tywaka Street in Philippi have been living with kak on their door steps for the past month. This is after the municipal officials couldn’t enter the kasi to fix the blocked pipes since they didn’t have escort. The residents told the SunTeam they reported the sewerage burst for the first time on 16 December but the problem had not been fixed and was getting worse. Some said their kids had developed a rash that they believed was caused by the kak water. “We had our Christmas surrounded by kak water. We are now in the new year but we are still talking about the same old problem,” said Nomawethu Qumza. Another resident Abongile Motswatswa (41) said the kak smell affected him a lot when it was time to go to bed at night. “It gets worse at times that I feel like the kak is next to my pillow. The life we have been living for the past few weeks makes me feel like I’m a prisoner,” he said. When the SunTeam visited the area on Thursday, 13 January, Ward Councillor Bennett Payiya was on the street with some workers from the municipality. He said he had also been asking them to fix the problem but they feared for their safety. “They told me they did not have security to escort them around. That is why I’m also here to ensure their safety,” he said. The MMC of water and sanitation, Councillor Zahid Badroodien said their workers were once shot in the area. “Our first line response teams work in volatile communities and in some cases, we have to arrange a law enforcement escort. The city’s law enforcement has a large number of escort requests from officials and our service schedule depends on the safety and security department’s availability. As you may be aware, a staff member was shot in this area while repairing the pipeline. Our teams have also been victims of armed robbery on several occasions in this area. Due to these reasons, it then becomes difficult to respond to residents’ service delivery complaints timeously,” he said.
