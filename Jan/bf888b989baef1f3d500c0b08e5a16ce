AMONG the shacks of Ethembeni squatter camp in Khayalitsa, Vuyani “Rasta” Madikane (49) has built a brick house. It is the area that residents invaded in 2020 during the peak of Covid-19. It is here where law enforcement dragged a man out of his shack naked while they were demolishing shacks. Madikane said he built a brick house last year because he will not agree to anyone moving him again. He showed the SunTeam the wounds where he had been shot with rubber bullets while fighting for the place. “It was like a war for me to be where I am today. I have been moving from one place to another in my life and I vow never to be moved again,” said Vuyani. “I have 11 children and have never had a place I call home all my life. I would rather die than be moved from here.” Though the people in the Ethembeni area had clashed with the City of Cape Town, they have, however, managed to speak to the City to provide them with services. MMC of Human Settlements Malusi Booi said the City of Cape had obtained an interdict to prevent residents from illegally occupying the land which is a wetland. “The City has conducted numerous operations to stop the residents from occupying this land but it became fully occupied as a result of public violence and overnight building activities,” Booi said. Booi said the residents are staying at the place at their own risk. He said the place was designed to catch water and no flood intervention will be feasible because of this. “For as long as the residents live in a dam it will flood when it rains,” he said. “The City has constantly advised that there are health and safety risks if residents remain on this land.”
