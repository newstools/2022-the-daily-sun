FORMER DA member and Midvaal municipality mayor Bongani Baloyi has joined ActionSA. This was revealed on Monday, 24 January, in Joburg. Baloyi said joining the party was his way of saying he was committed to working for the betterment of South Africa. “I’m encouraged by the brand of ActionSA,” he said. He said he had a fantastic journey with the DA, but it was time to move on. “My joining ActionSA is not out of anger or disappointment. It is actually by the hope they invoke in me. All South Africans need to join hands because we have one enemy and that is the ANC,” said Baloyi. He said he was proud of his record and the work he achieved as a member of the DA. He thanked the people of Midvaal for their support. Baloyi became the youngest Mzansi mayor when he was appointed in 2013. He was only 26 years old. He served two consecutive terms as mayor with seven clean audits. “I’m committed to project 2024 of unseating the ANC and I will be using my skills, capacity and experience in government to bring good governance to even more South Africans. I’m really excited. As they say azikhale,” said Baloyi. ActionSA president Herman Mashaba said he was proud to welcome Baloyi to his party. “Baloyi’s reputation of excellence is well-known. He has served in government for nearly a decade. ActionSA2024 project is well underway,” he said. He said the project was meant to save the people of South Africa.
