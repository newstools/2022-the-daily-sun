FOUR suspects have been bust and a fifth killed after their getaway vehicle overturned during a high-speed chase with police. They had allegedly robbed a post office in De Doorns on Tuesday but were later arrested in Paarl near Cape Town, almost 100km from the crime scene. The suspects allegedly entered the post office and threatened the staff with guns before they took money, Sassa cards and then left. Police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk said the suspects were bust after the information was relayed through police radios. “The suspects held staff at the post office at gunpoint and fled with cash and Sassa cards. The information was broadcasted on police radios and several police vehicles participated in the search for the fleeing suspects. In Paarl, the suspects overturned their vehicle which led to their arrest. Three unlicensed firearms and the stolen cash and cards were seized,” said Van Wyk. He said the suspects would appear in De Doorns once charged.  Post office spokesman Johan Kruger confirmed to Daily Sun that their De Doorns branch was robbed. “The robbers tied up the employees at the post office and fled in a silver Toyota double cab bakkie with an undisclosed amount of cash. Members of the public immediately reported the incident to the police, who pursued the getaway vehicle. The vehicle overturned outside Paarl. One of the suspects lost his life and four were arrested,” said Kruger. This incident comes after two armed men robbed a post office in the Gatesville area on 7 December last year. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said the men entered the post office around 7.40am and robbed it but cops quickly reacted. “Several shots were fired as the suspects fled the scene. SAPS and Metro Police responded to the robbery and managed to arrest both suspects, aged 28 and 39,” Traut said.
