ORLANDO Pirates will qualify for the quarterfinals of the Caf Confederation Cup! This is the prediction of Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane after the Soweto giants were drawn in the continental tournament Group B against Algerian side JS Kabylie or Eswatini outfit Royal Leopards, JS Saoura of Algeria and Libyan side Al Ittihad in Cairo, Egypt on Tuesday . “It’s a very tricky one as Algerian and Libyan teams always cancel each other out,” said Mosimane, who is now one of the most respected coaches in the continent after success with Mamelodi Sundowns and now with the Red Devils. “I fancy the Buccaneers to come out of the group but you know the story with JS Kabylie, they are always a very strong team. But Pirates looks good. I think they (Pirates) will go the quarterfinals and maybe JS Kabylie too (if they qualify).” Added the 57-year-old Kagiso-born mentor: “I don’t know about Saoura but Al Ittihad are always in this tournament and the Champions League. So you never know but I fancy Orlando Pirates.” The last time the Soweto giants won a continental competition was in 1995 when they lifted the Champions Cup (now renamed the Caf Champions League) beating Ivory Coast giants ASEC Mimosas 1-0 in Abidjan in the second leg via a goal from their legendary striker Jerry Sikhosana to win the trophy 3-2 on aggregate. But in 2013, Pirates made it to the Champions League final but lost to Al Ahly. In 2015, Bucs lost the Confed Cup final to Tunisian side Etoile du Sahel. The only drawback for Pirates co-coaches Mandla Ncikazi and Fadlu Davids this time will be travelling to North Africa three times in February if Kabylie beat Leopards in their postponed clash. Kabylie’s game with Leopards was delayed due to complications of travelling due to Covid-19.
