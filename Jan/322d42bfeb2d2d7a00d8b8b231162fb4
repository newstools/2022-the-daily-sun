THE Shabalala family was looking forward to 2021 being a year of celebrations. Members of the family from Nongoma, northern KZN, had two big traditional ceremonies planned and started saving at the beginning of the year. However, things started going wrong in March and their joy turned to sorrow. Everything they bought for their celebrations, including gifts for their in-laws ahead of a wedding, was devoured by a mysterious fire, suspected of being vutha. Qhamukile Zulu (48), whose family was meant to receive the izibizo gifts, said they were forced to postpone the ceremony. “This mysterious fire just came from the wall and started burning things,” she said. Qhamukile said when it first happened, she thought maybe the ancestors did not approve of her marriage. “We went to a sangoma who told us our ancestors were angry and we should have a ceremony to apologise. “We did this but more fires came. We saw other izangoma, who told us the fire was sent by someone who was jealous,” she said. Qhamukile’s daughter Zandile Shabalala (24) said at one point, fires were breaking out every day. She said vutha started attacking every day after her uncle’s wedding in September. “As this is a rural area, there are different houses in the same yard but we have lost everything in all the houses. “The fire comes through the wall,” said Zandile. She said before a fire started, a little hole appeared in a wall and left a dark mark like it was hit by fireworks. “We don’t buy groceries any more because they will be destroyed. We just go to the spaza shop. “We don’t understand who would want us to suffer like this,” she said. KZN Traditional Healers Association chairman Thandonjani Hlongwane said the family needed a powerful inyanga to get rid of vutha or it would terrorise them for the rest of their lives.
