LIFA Hlongwane has vowed to get his football career back on track. The 28-year-old midfielder has joined DStv Premiership bottom side TS Galaxy after parting ways with Maritzburg United last month. Hlongwane signed with the Team of Choice at the beginning of this season, but his contract was terminated due to allegations of ill-discipline. The former Black Leopards star was reported to be skipping training and enjoying party lifestyle, which did not sit well with the KwaZulu-Natal based side chairman Farook Kadodia. At United, the Diepkloof-born star lasted only five months after signing a two-year contract and played 12 league matches scoring one goal. But now Hlongwane is aiming to prove that he still has what it takes to shine in the top flight. “It feels great to join TS Galaxy,” Hlongwane said. “I love Galaxy as they play football that suits my style of play. “I am confident that I will adjust fast. I also think I will have a great season at Galaxy and help them survive relegation and finish (the league in) a good position. I’m also targeting to score six goals in their remaining matches. “I’m not feeling any pressure as I am not scared of any team. I’m here at Galaxy to do my best and enjoy playing football again. Honestly, I don’t see Galaxy get relegated after I have seen the players we have at training. “I think all we have to do is to change our attitude and make sure we win games. The good thing is that the point gap between us (Galaxy) and other teams who are above us is not that big.” The Rockets are bottom on the log with 13 points with 13 matches remaining to end the season, which resumes next month after the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations finals being played in Cameroon.
