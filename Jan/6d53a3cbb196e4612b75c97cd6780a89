FIVE people including a child were injured after a VW Polo allegedly skipped a red light and ploughed into a Fiat Uno in Heideveld, Cape Town. According to cops, the driver of the Polo was drunk. The driver was saved unscathed by cops as people bayed for his blood after the incident. The Uno was driving from Ascension Road into Duinefontein Road towards Gugulethu and the Polo from the N2. Matthew Peterson (23), who saw the accident, said the Polo failed to stop at the traffic light. “The Uno was already in the middle of the robot when the Polo came up flying. At first I thought I was dreaming. He rammed into the Uno on its left side and the next thing people from the Uno were screaming for help. Lots of accidents happen at this robot, but I had never witnessed one happening.” A fuel attendant from the Shell on Ascension Road was shocked because he’d just filled up the Uno minutes before the accident. “I filled up some fuel for them. It was unbelievable to see they were involved in an accident. Somebody told me there was an accident by the robots so when they described the cars involved, I went there to check, only to find out it was the family I had just served.” Captain Frederick Van Wyk confirmed the incident. “A case of reckless and negligent driving as well as drunken driving has been registered. According to reports, the driver of the white Polo jumped a red robot and collided with a green Uno. The driver of the Polo has also been arrested for drunken driving by SAPS members. A boy was injured and taken for medical treatment by ambulance. The driver of the Polo has been charged and is being released on bail,” he said. Traffic services spokesman Richard Coleman also confirmed the incident.
