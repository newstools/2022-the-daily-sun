IN THIS week’s episode of Digital Bones, sangoma Nzama Maluleke explains a dream to a SunReader. The reader wrote to the People’s Paper complaining he had the same terrible dream every night. He said in the dream, he was driving a car and it always ended up in a river. Nzama said the dream was a warning from the ancestors. “Something is following him. He needs to watch out,” he said. He said there could be evil people who weren’t happy with the reader’s success and would do anything to see it die. “He needs to stand up and do something now,” Nzama said the reader needed to go to a sangoma for strength. “If he has bought a new car, he needs to strengthen it too, because that’s where they’ll catch him.” He said evil people would try anything to get at someone they wanted to hurt. “If they try one thing and it doesn’t work, they will try some’thing else. That’s why it’s important to be strengthened.” Nzama said when a car was strengthened, it was protected against everything, including theft, hijacking and evil accidents. “There are normal accidents and there are accidents caused by evil people. Your car needs to be strong. People shouldn’t find it easy to just do anything to it,” he said.
