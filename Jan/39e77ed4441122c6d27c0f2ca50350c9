CRICKET South Africa (CSA) has moved to clarify why they have kept some hospitality suites open at the Wanderers while crowds aren’t allowed in to watch at the stadium. CSA has explained that the hospitality tickets they have made available for the ongoing Test series between South Africa and India aren’t for sale. They said they are part of commercial deliverables for their partners. Fans are not allowed to watch the matches at stadiums. Those watching the second Test between the Proteas and India on television have noticed spectators who are clearly not part of the playing groups or backroom staff watching the action from the suites in the ground. In a statement released yesterday as the rain fell in Joburg, CSA said the hospitality tickets that have been used to allow some people to watch at the stadium form part of a commercial deliverable and they are not for sale. At the first Test between India and South Africa at SuperSport Park in Centurion, there were also few hospitality boxes that were open and attended to by some supporters. The same has been applied for the ongoing second Test at the Wanderers. “CSA is still contractually obligated to issue hospitality tickets to its commercial partners and guests travelling with Team India. Therefore, attendance of matches by commercial partners is a contractual commercial deliverable, in pursuance of partner obligations,” the statement said. XSport24
