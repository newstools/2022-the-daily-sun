EAST London cops are investigating an attack on the home of senior Amathole Municipality ANC councillor Nanziwe Rulashe in Eastern Cape. A gunman opened fire through the bedroom window of the 40-year-old strategic management and development MMC’s Baysville home. Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana confirmed the incident happened at about 2am on Sunday, 30 January. He said: “An unidentified suspect arrived and started shooting shots through the bedroom window. The MMC was not present, but only children who allegedly escaped unhurt, as they were in other rooms. The circumstances surrounding the incident are not known.” Last week, Rulashe was seen being dragged and assaulted by security guards at her municipal office in a video that went viral on social media. Five accused appeared in the East London Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 25 January, in connection with the incident.  The five, aged 23 to 43, face charges of assault, malicious damage to property and intimidation. They were granted bail of R500 and will be back in court on 11 March. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nomthetheleli Mene has ordered a task team to be set up with capable investigators and appointed a senior officer to lead investigations. No arrests were made at this stage. Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of those responsible can call CrimeStop at 08600 10111.
