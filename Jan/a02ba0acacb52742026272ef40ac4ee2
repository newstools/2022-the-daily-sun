THE alleged arsonist responsible for the blaze that gutted parts of Parliament, including the National Assembly, appeared briefly in the Cape Town Magistrates Court. Zandile Mafe’s case was postponed to 11 January after his application was denied on Tuesday, 4 January when the state asked for more time to prepare and investigate further to confirm his place of residence. Mafe was bust on Sunday, 2 December at about dawn in the Parliament precinct after fire had broken out on the premises. He was allegedly found in possession of items stolen from inside Parliament. Dressed in a grey shirt and shorts, Mafe, who is believed to live in Khayelitsha, seemed dazed as he stood in the dock and turned round as cameras snapped him. He is facing charges of theft, housebreaking and arson and will be charged under the National Key Point Act.
