COASTAL United reached the DStv Compact Cup final after thumping Dinaledi FC 3-0 in the semi final at the Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Stellenbosch forward Ashley Du Preez, Cape Town City defender Taariq Fielies, all scored in the first half. City young star Lufuno Sifumba added the gloss to the score, curling home the third in the second half. Dinaledi, coached Dan Malesela, were toothless and chances they had all could not go pass Baroka towering ‘keeper Oscarine Masuluke. The only came close to score but Mamelodi Sundowns’ Gaston Sirino missed a penalty in the second half. The Coastal side, coached by Steve Barker, were first on the money, as Du Preez fired them home in the ninth minute. This after Luke Fleurs’ miscued clearance and fell to Evidence Makgopa whose attempted shot was saved by Ricardo Goss. While Dinaledi tried to reply through Sirino, they fluffed their chances and one in particular Thabo Rakhale later in the game. Dinaledi replied and Masuluke had to improvise to clear by adjusting his feet to clear the goal line shot in the 29th minute. Du Preez also came close again to make it two on the night for himself but missed the target in the 33rd minute. However, Fielies made it 2-0 in the 36th minute, sliding the ball through the crowd, leaving Ricardo Goss stranded in goals. Dinaledi got a better chance in the 53rd minute as they were awarded a penalty. But Sirino was given a confidence to take the spot but his penalty was poorly taken as Masuluke dived to his right to save it. However, the day will belong to Sifumba of Cape Town City. The 15-year-old scored in his touch, beating Reyaad Pieterse just outside the box with a curler, to make it 3-0 which excited his coach Eric Tinkler in the stands. The latter was in the stands as the part of the Coastal technical team. However, Coastal finished with 10 men as Robyn Johannes was sent off.
