SOME of the scents that become really unpopular during summer are bad armpit smells. According to health experts, sweat tends to cool the body down, but our body odour is because of bacteria in our sweat. When the sweat can’t dry up easily, or gets trapped in clothes, especially synthetic materials, we tend to give off a sweaty smell and our armpits tend to get that bad odour. So apart from applying roll-ons, how can we naturally remedy the smell of our armpits? According to https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com, here are the natural ways of remedying smelly armpits: 1.Use coarse salt Add some rock salt to a bucketfull of lukewarm water. Mix well until it dissolves and then take a shower with it. It has cleansing properties and also eliminates extra sweat. 2.Spray on some apple cider vinegar Take a cup of apple cider vinegar and mix it with half a half of cup of water. Put this in a spray bottle and use it every night on your underarms before sleeping.
