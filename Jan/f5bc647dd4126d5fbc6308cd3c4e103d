TSHEPO “Skhwama” Matete is back in the professional ranks! The skilful and versatile player, who is famous in the Kasi games, has joined Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) on a short-term deal that will see him at the GladAfrica Championship club until end of the current season. Last month, Matete was part of the 18 Mambas team that reached four finals (The Philly’s Games, Imbewu Enhle, Kwa-Mahlobo games and Snekeneke Pre-Festive Games). This will not be Matete’s first time in the Championship. He played for the University of Pretoria in 2020 in the First Division. “It is good to be back,” he said. “I know I need to work hard to play again. I’m grateful for the opportunity and they have given me more freedom to play the football I know.” Matete, who signed his first professional contract in 2015 when he joined Baroka FC, has not delivered much in the professional ranks. And that led to him being criticised for not being a team player. When asked about his role and what will be different this time at TTM, Matete said he has grown as a player. “The past stints with the different clubs came with lessons,” he said. However, TTM will not limit him on how he should play. He explained: “It depends on the coaches. When I was at Tuks, coach Zipho (Dlangalala) gave me an opportunity and allowed me to be myself. “Even now, at TTM, they are not limiting me because I can only do better when I play my football. “I have to be Skhwama at the end of the day, but more mature now. I have improved a lot, my defending and fitness level. Now I just have to take this chance and work hard.” Matete, who can play as a wing-back, winger and midfielder, has played for Baroka and AmaTuks in Mzansi and Township Rollers in Botswana. TTM will be hoping to turn around their fortunes when the league resumes next month. In 17 matches, TTM are 12th with 19 points, six points ahead of bottom club Jomo Cosmos.
