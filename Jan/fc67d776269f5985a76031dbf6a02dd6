TWO years after the death of gospel singer Pastor Neyi Zimu, his widow is still struggling. Pastor Nelisiwe Zimu told Daily Sun losing him was the most painful thing. Neyi, the founder of all Nations Revival Ministries in Tshwane, died of cancer in 2019. Nelisiwe, a medical doctor, said she started the Neyi Zimu Foundation in 2019 to support cancer patients and young artists. “He left a big gap as a father and spiritual leader.” Nelisiwe said although lockdown made it difficult to run the foundation, they continued with their work online and at home.

She said she told church members that although her husband was gone, his teachings were still with them. “It’s challenging to run a church but it’s fulfilling. I am a doctor and have to balance two callings. In hospital, I do physical healing and at church, spiritual healing.” With lockdown easing, she planned to hold a tribute for her husband. “People are still blessed with his music. It will be fitting to keep the momentum going through a concert,” she said. Nelisiwe would continue releasing gospel music and identifying young artists in his memory. Her message to others who had lost loved ones was not to give up and to hold on to God.
