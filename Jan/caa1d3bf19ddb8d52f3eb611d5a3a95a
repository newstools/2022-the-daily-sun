PATRICK Ntuli has been missing since September and after spending Christmas without him, his family is very worried. The 51-year-old from Soshanguve, Tshwane, is mentally challenged and suffers from epilepsy. His mum Linah (69) told Daily Sun she had looked for him everywhere, including mortuaries and hospitals, with no luck. Linah said on 28 September, Patrick went out without saying where he was going and never returned. She said although he had his own place in block MM, he spent most of his time at her house. “He just left at around 10am without saying anything. We are used to him coming and going but he always returns. Unfortunately, he has not been back since that day,” she said. “I have been looking for him since then. People have told me they spotted him in various places but when I go to check, he’s nowhere to be found.  “This has really taken a toll on me because last January, I lost my husband. I can’t lose two people I love within a year of each other.” Linah said she couldn’t sleep at night and every morning, she went out to look for Patrick. “I have been to Odi and George Mukhari hospitals and government mortuaries. but he is not there. “I’m very worried because he is mentally ill and has epilepsy. My wish is for SunLanders to help me find him,” she said. Linah said on New Year’s Eve, the police told her they couldn’t find Patrick but they’d continue with their search. “I even searched for him at dumpsites,but I have run out of ideas and I’m starting to lose hope,” she said. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a missing persons case has been opened and investigations are continuing.
