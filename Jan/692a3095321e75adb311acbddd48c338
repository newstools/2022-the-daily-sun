DA shadow MEC for sports, arts, culture and recreation Kingsol Chabalala alleges that MEC Mbali Hlophe spent R7 million on a three-hour event while Gauteng athletes and artists are struggling. Chabalala said many Gauteng artists and athletes had lost their livelihoods and had been forced into unemployment because of the Covid-19 lockdown. “The DA has been reliably informed that the department has spent R7 million on the 2021 Gauteng Sports Awards despite the DA cautioning the department on excessive spending on this event. There was nothing spectacular about the event. Guests were served a three-course meal with a soft drink or juice and only three renowned artists performed at the event,” he said. Chabalala said the money spent on the awards could have been used to provide relief grant to 1 166 athletes and artists at a rate of R6 000 each. He said in the 2019/2020 financial year, the department spent R9 494 000 on the awards. “We demand a breakdown of how R7 million was spent on this event, considering that it was an in-door event and there is a limitation in terms of the number of people who can attend such events due to Covid-19 regulations,” said Chabalala. Nkosana Mtolo, spokesman for MEC Hlophe, said they had hoped the criticism would be constructive and based on facts instead of gossip. “The fact is the department has to date spent R19,6 million on Covid-19 relief grants and close to 3 000 artists and athletes have benefitted,” he said. Mtolo claimed it is a lie that the department had spent R7 million on the awards.
