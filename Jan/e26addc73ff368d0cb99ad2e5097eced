TIRELONG Secondary School pupils in Kroondal near Rustenburg, North West, will return to classrooms from Friday, 14 January. This after parents finally agreed to allow the relocation of pupils to other schools. The parents initially didn’t want their kids to be moved to other schools despite their school being in a bad state after it was vandalised last month. On Wednesday, 12 January, parents protested, demanding mobile classes instead of relocation. They continued with the protest on Thursday, 13 January, but public order policing officers were on sight to maintain law and order. One of the parents told Daily Sun they agreed to move the pupils because of the pressure from the Department of Basic Education. “We also want our children in school. But our fear is that the school will never be fixed,” he said. “We did not receive a time frame on how long our kids will attend other schools, which are far from us.” School Governing Body member, Moilwa Molotsi, said parents were anxious. He said sending pupils far from home was not ideal for them. “We hope the department will ensure pupils don’t face any complications as time goes on,” said Moilwa. North West Education MEC Mmaphefo Matsemela said parents of grade 12 pupils agreed to the proposal by signing consent forms, giving pupils permission to relocate to a boarding school. Grade 12 pupils were transported to the boarding school by the department. “We will transport grade 8 and 10 pupils as well,” said Matsemela. Matsemela claimed those who were protesting and blocking roads were not parents of the pupils, but people who “just wanted to destroy the future of pupils”. “The department is pleading for cooperation with all stakeholders in order to build the future of pupils of Tirelong Secondary School,” she said.
