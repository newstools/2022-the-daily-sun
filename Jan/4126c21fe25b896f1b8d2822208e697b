A
man died at Witsand beach in the Western Cape on Sunday. According
to the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), emergency services were called to
the beach on Sunday at around 12:30, after the body of a man was found in the
water. Members
of the NSRI Witsand duty crew were activated following reports of a suspected
drowning in progress at the Witsand main beach, said NSRI Witsand coxswain Thys
Carstens. "On
arrival on the scene, we found a 73-year-old male from Heidelberg had been
rescued from the water by bystanders after he had been found floating,
lifeless, in the water," said Carstens. NSRI
medics and a local doctor commenced with CPR, but the man was declared dead at
the scene. The
case was handed over to the police for investigation. "It
is suspected that the man may have suffered a medical condition. Police have
opened an inquest docket," said Carstens. The
body of the man was handed over to Government Health Forensic Pathology
Services. Meanwhile,
search efforts continued for a teenager who was reported missing at sea at a
Blythedale beach, north of Durban, on Saturday evening, News24 previously

an extensive search, there remained no sign of the teenager. The search will
