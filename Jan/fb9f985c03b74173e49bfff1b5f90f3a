TS GALAXY midfielder, Karabo Tshepe, has revealed that had it not been for the support from his family and responsibilities, he would have given up playing football. At the beginning of last season, Tshepe sustained a serious knee injury and was forced to undergo an operation that disrupted his promising start at Galaxy, having joined them from Black Leopards. Now it has been 14 months of no-action for him. He told SunSport yesterday that he has admitted frustration, also revealing that at some point, he was feeling like giving up. “It has not been easy, I do not want to lie. I have been out for too long, right now I just want to see myself playing football again,” said Tshepe, who is a bread winner to his family and children. “At first, I could not run. I could not walk because my knee was swollen. I had to get it fixed. Now I have recovered from the long-term injury. “I started training with the DStv Diski Challenge team. But there is a niggling pain that I feel on the side of my knee. “Now I cannot even jump appropriately because of that pain. I have consulted with doctors, and they said there is nothing. Next week I’m going to see the doctor again, hoping that we’ll find the problem and sort it out, added Tshepe. “It’s really frustrating, but I can’t give up. I have responsibilities to take care of and my family that has been supportive throughout this journey. But I have faith in God. Kuzolunga.” Galaxy are at the bottom of the log with 13 points from 17 matches Tshepe said it also hurts to see the team struggling in the DStv Premiership, and he cannot help.
