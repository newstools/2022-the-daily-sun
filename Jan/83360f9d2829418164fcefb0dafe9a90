YouTube podcast The Master Class Podcast wants to teach people about all things music. Hosted by YFM presenter OG Samke and former Metro FM presenterRashid Kay, the weekly show was about the South African music history, especially hip-hop. Samke told SunBuzz about the show: “The idea was because we felt there was a gap between documenting SA hip-hop history and educating people on where it comes from. The podcast is like a class where we document and tell people about the history of music, especially hip-hop.” ALSO READ : UZALO ACTRESS HEARTBROKEN BY RUMOURS OF HER 'DEATH' He said they spoke about content that would have a lasting impact. “We want it to live online forever, we don’t want to speak about things happening at the moment. We speak about things that live forever. We’ve had episodes where we speak about homophobia in hip-hop, contracts and teaching young artists on how to sign. However, at the same time, we are also learning from the comments.” Samke said he and Rashid were a good match. “I’m the OG to the young kids and up-and-coming hip-hop musicians, but Rashid is the OG for the SA hip-hop space. He has all the information about hip-hop, and when you merge those two dynamics, then you can educate young people about the future and speak to them,” he said. Samke said a lot will be coming from The Master Class Podcast this year. “We have a lot of plans for the channel. We are trying to create a network and have a female podcast about just hip-hop. We’ll also be doing a master class tour and go to hip-hop spots around the country. More is coming.”
