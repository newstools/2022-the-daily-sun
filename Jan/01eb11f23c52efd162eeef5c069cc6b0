MPUMALANGA cops have launched a manhunt for thugs who allegedly stole donated shoes and stationery on Wednesday, 19 January, at St Peters International Independent School in Kwaggafontein. According to spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, a security guard was allegedly attacked by seven unknown suspects while conducting patrol at the school at around 11.15pm. Mohlala said the suspects tied up the guard in the administration office and demanded his cellphone, 22 pairs of school shoes, 186 packs of Typek paper and 75 packs of toilet paper before they disappeared. A business robbery case has since been registered. Mohlala said police have appealed to anyone with information to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111.
