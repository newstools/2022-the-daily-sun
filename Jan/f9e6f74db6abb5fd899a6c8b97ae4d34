FORMER Orlando Pirates striker, Justin Shonga, is optimistic of reviving his fading career at Sekhukhune United. The Zambian international confirmed to SunSport that he has finally signed with the DStv Premiership newcomers this week after he parted ways with Egyptian side Ismaily SC last month. Shonga, the once feared striker in the Premiership during his time with the Soweto giants in 2017-18 season, has promised to give his best at Babina Noko. “I want to regain my best (form) and help Sekhukhune United finish the season in a good position,” said Shonga, who did not want to reveal how long is his new contract with the Limpopo-based side. But a source told SunSport that Shonga has signed a contract with United until end of this season. “Shonga is a good player and United want to give him a chance to revive his football career,” said the source. “For Shonga to win a long term contract with United, he needs to show his best form. He (Shonga) needs to work hard and prove to coach MacDonald Makhubedu that he can add value to the team.” Since leaving Bucs in 2018, the 25-year-old player has played for Marumo Gallants when they were still called Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Cape Town City. But he never spent more than six months with any of those clubs. At Gallants in the 2018-19 season, Shonga left after only spending three months with the then Venda-based side. He then signed with the Citizens last January, but his contract was terminated at the end of last season due to poor performances. Shonga then signed for Ismaily last October, but he terminated his contract after spending only two months in Egypt. And now it remains to be seen if he will last longer at United.
