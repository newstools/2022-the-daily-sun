THE Chinese automotive industry has weathered the storm of the last two years, and no company has done so better than Chery. Despite disruptions such as a shortage of electronic components, shipping delays, and sales restrictions in many international markets, Chery produced 961 926 cars in 2021, according to industry sales data. Of its total production, Chery exported 269 154 cars or nearly 30% of its production volume to international markets. This makes Chery China’s largest car exporter, a position that it has held for the past 19 years in a row. Executive deputy general manager of Chery South Africa Tony Liu said as China’s largest car exporter and one of its best known vehicle brands, Chery is now comfortable in many of the largest automotive markets in the world. “In fact, two million of our 10 million current customers are in markets outside China,” said Liu. Liu said Chery has not only found new customers, but also many more fans in its major export markets.  In Russia, the Tiggo 8 Pro was voted the Most Popular Chinese SUV, Most Technologically Advanced SUV and it earned the award as the automotive media’s Most Popular Medium-sized SUV. In Qatar, the Tiggo 7 Pro was voted the country’s best- selling SUV after it became the top-selling SUV a mere three months after its introduction in the country. “And in South Africa, the SA Guild of Motoring Journalists has selected the Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, our first model, as one of the semi-finalists for the 2022 SA Car of the Year competition. We are truly honoured to be on the shortlist after such a brief time in the country,” said Liu. Chery considered quality as its second major growth pillar, both the quality of the product and of its customer service. “In today’s highly competitive market, quality is the table stakes that merely ensure your entry into the market. That is why Chery South Africa has completely changed the rules of the game with a one million kilometre, 10-year mechanical warranty,” added Liu.
