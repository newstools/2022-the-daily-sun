AFTER residents blocked the road on Monday, 17 January, councillor Kate Mabaswa from Odi near Mabopane in Tshwane was forced to defend herself. She said: “I have never interfered in any project. When I intervene, it’s after residents ask me to. That’s not interfering.” Mabaswa said a group of community liaison officers were organising protests. “I would also like to appeal to them to stop using the name of late councillor Tshepo Motaung whenever they protest. “They should focus on dealing with the issues facing the community.When people approach me to raise issues relating to projects, I have to stand up and address the concerns. When I do this, they end up closing streets and causing chaos.” Residents said Mabaswa wanted her friends and family to be employed. They said the former councillor worked hard for projects for locals to be given opportunities to work and the new councillor was destroying all his hard work. “We’re scared to talk because we heard the councillor hangs around dangerous people who might be sent to finish off those who question her leadership skills,” said a resident. “She’s not even set up a meeting to introduce herself. Instead, she’s meddling in construction projects, wanting to know which people are being employed.” Another protester said whenever there was a protest, the councillor was unavailable. “If she was a good leader, she would run when she heard people were burning tyres. She is ignoring us as residents.” Mabaswa said she would soon be meeting all project managers to resolve all the issues raised by residents.
