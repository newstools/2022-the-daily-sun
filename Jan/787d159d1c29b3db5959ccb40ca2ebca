IT HAS been five days since the trial of the alleged mastermind behind Tshegofatso Pule’s murder, Ntuthuko Shoba, began. Muzikayise Malephane, who claimed to have been tasked by Shoba to kill Pule, continues under cross-examination. On Thursday, Malephane told the court that he hanged Pule 800m away from his place of residence. He said he had bought the illegal gun he used months prior to the incident, claiming it was for his safety. He told the court that he did not tell or take the police to where he bought the gun because he couldn’t even if he wanted to. “I had been driving around for a while looking for a place where I could hang her and was getting frustrated. I then decided to go to Durban Deep along a very dark road to hang her on a tree. I just wanted to get it over and done with; I wanted to forget about that night,” said Malephane. Shoba’s defence Norman Makhubela questioned the credibility of Malephane’s statements, claiming the witness was obsessed with involving Shoba in a crime he did not commit. Malephane’s first statement was that he was with Shoba during the commission of the crime, which he later changed. He claimed he decided to speak the truth so Pule’s family could find peace and Shoba’s true role be exposed. Makhubela questioned his motive in giving out a “true confession”. He said Malephane only gave his confession because he had been given a plea deal that would give him a lighter sentence. Malephane maintained that all he did was take instructions from Shoba. He said Shoba now wanted him to take the fall alone, yet he did not know Pule or even had her phone numbers. Evidence from cellphone records have showed that on 29 May, Malephane called Pule. “Shoba gave me her number to call her because I had been waiting for her at McDonald’s. He told me that she was not taking her calls. Eventually I left. Clearly at that point, the plan had to change and that was in Shoba’s hands,” said Malephane.
