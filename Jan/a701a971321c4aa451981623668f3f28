RESIDENTS of Mthatha in the Eastern Cape are accusing the Madeira cop station of charging them to certify their documents. One resident visited the station and when she got there, she was allegedly told to go to the temporary structures next to the station to certify her documents. “Just before I could enter the premises, I met three guys who offered to make things easy for me by taking my documents inside while I waited for them outside.” When she asked why were they offering to do that, they allegedly told her if she didn’t pay them R10 for each document, she’d wait in the queue for hours. “At first I thought they were playing until I saw a long queue. I went to the residents who were queuing and asked if the queue was slow or what and they responded they were being punished since they refused to pay the money.” She then allegedly decided to pay because she was rushing somewhere. The SunTeam visited the station and was told to go to the temporary structures, where we were asked to pay the money. Residents said they couldn’t be paying for free government things. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Kaya Matola-Mvenyashe said the department was not aware of allegations that members were soliciting a fee for such a service at one of the stations. “An affidavit is a sworn statement which could be written by any police officer, and that service is available free of charge at all police stations.” Mvenyashe said police were viewing this in a serious light and were urging anyone with information to lodge a formal complaint or a criminal case of fraud for further investigation.
