“I WOULD rather sing gospel in taverns and shebeens than churches because pastors are making churches look fake.” This was what legendary musician William Mthethwa said after a number of church scandals. The musician from Lenasia, south of Joburg, started his career as a pop, reggae and disco singer in 1975 but switched to gospel in 1986. He was inspired by his late father, Bushop John Masondo Mthethwa of Faith Mission Church. William has condemned pastors who use gospel and the church as business opportunities. “Some pastors are greedy. They’re after money and do horrible things. They must stop being wolves in sheep skin. There are fake pastors who are evil,” he said. ALSO READ : ‘MAMKHIZE’ SCAMMED ME! William, who doesn’t drink or smoke, also lashed out at gospel artists who took drugs, drank and chased after material things, calling them hijackers of gospel. “I don’t sing for money and fame but to preach the good news to people. What has kept me going all these years is prayer,” he said. William said he used the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020 to write 17 songs and released his 12th gospel album Moment of Silence at the beginning of January. “This album is dedicated to Christians around the world, Covid-19 victims and social and health workers. The first track is Lefu la Corona, a tribute song to Covid-19.” He said last March, he started the William Mthethwa Foundation to help poor and up-and-coming artists. In November, he started Project Gospel Piano to help young people who are vulnerable.
