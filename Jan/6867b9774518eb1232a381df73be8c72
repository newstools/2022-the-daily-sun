AN ANC
Women’s League lecture due to be addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa at
Lebowakgomo Civic Centre was called off on Thursday, 6 January after the league
broke lockdown regulations. It was
discovered the number of people who had entered the hall were over the limit
and that others who’d entered the hall had not been scanned. According
to adjusted alert level 1 regulations, gatherings are restricted to no more
than 1 000 people indoors and no more than 2 000 people outdoors. Where the
venue is too small to accommodate these numbers with appropriate social
distancing, then no more than 50% of the capacity of the venue may be used. Ramaphosa
had arrived in the hall to a warm welcome, but had to leave soon afterwards
when the organisers were informed there were people who had entered the hall
without being scanned and this led to the number of people allowed by
regulations being breached. League
deputy president Sisi Ntombela explained to members that due to the breach,
Ramaphosa would no longer deliver the lecture because he’d be party to the
violation of regulations if he did so. “We can not
allow the president to continue to deliver the lecture because we would be
putting him at risk with all the problems we are having,” she said. Ntombela
announced the league would have to arrange another date for the lecture to be
addressed by the president.
