DJS and producers, DJ Mikah S and C Keys, have partnered up to produce some good music. The musicians, whose real names are Michael “DJ Mikah S” Sibisi (35) and Charity “C Keys” Kobo (43), will be releasing three singles next Saturday, 29 January. They are not a duo, but they joined forces to drop music together. Mikah told SunBuzz about the new songs. “The three singles are titled Thuse Ntate, Corrections and Ma Sghebengu. My favourite one is Ma Sghebengu, which is about a lady who is very street wise and intelligent. But she’s also cool and is a pantsula. She is a bit of a gangster but is still attractive. I love her the way she is. ALSO READ : THENJI ON HER MRS WORLD JOURNEY “I don’t even have eyes for other women as she plays the main charector in my life,” said Mikah. The two musicians have been working together for years “We met through a mutual friend who is also in the music business and we clicked. We started by working on some music for a group we were working with. “Later on we started doing beats for artists and writing songs for them because we love creating music, especially for up-and-coming talent,” said Mikah. “What drew us to working together is that we’ve always loved the music. We have done songs with big names like Brian Temba, Kabomo and more. C Keys has had an opportunity to play instruments for the likes of Benjamin Dube, Afrika Mkhize, Kholeka, Lira and Joe Nina. Together, we have found some new talent as well. We work well together,” he said. They will be dropping an album soon. “We have a full 12-track album that’s ready and we’ll release it soon,” he said.
