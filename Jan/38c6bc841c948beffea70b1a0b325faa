RELEGATION-THREATENED Baroka FC will leave no stone unturned in their quest to avoid the dreaded axe. The Limpopo-based outfit were hard at work when the other teams eased their training programmes and released the players to spend time with their families during the festive season. The ship is sinking, and the management is looking for ways to save it before it is too late. Bakgaga were drawn into an all Premiership affair in the Nedbank Cup first round against Stellenbosch FC. However, the acting CEO Richard Mashabane said they are more concerned about winning the Limpopo derby against Marumo Gallants than booking a place in the second round. If they had to choose between progressing to the next round of the cup competition and winning their next league game, they would take the three points. The Premiership is on recess due to the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) taking place in Cameroon. After the break, Bakgaga will play against Marumo in the Limpopo derby on 16 February. Their mission is to get the three points in the derby and climb their way up the log table. “We are only thinking about the derby and not the cup competition. If we have to choose, we have to go for the league. We started training on 2 January and gave the players three days to cool off. We have been training non-stop. The ship is sinking, and we are worried about our league position,” Mashabane told SunSport yesterday. Bakgaga are second from the bottom of the log table with 13 points from 17 games tied on points with the bottom of the log TS Galaxy. “We have to move away from relegation. We have quality players in the team we have to start winning games. The cup competition is not a priority. We are more concerned about surviving relegation,” added Mashabane.
