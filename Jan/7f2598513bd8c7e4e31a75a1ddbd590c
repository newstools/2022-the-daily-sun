RADIO presenter and reality TV star Dineo Ranaka is back on air. This comes after she was allegedly suspended for taking part in the #UmlandoChallenge and dancing on top of office furniture. She was gone for a week and resumed her duties as host of The Bridge on Metro FM on Monday, 24 January. News of her alleged suspension caused an uproar and the hashtag #BringBackDineoRanaka, started by media personality Zola Hashatsi, trended. In the video that landed her in hot water, Dineo can be seen dancing on two tables and a chair. After the incident, SABC corporate affairs and marketing head Gugu Ntuli told the SunTeam she couldn’t discuss the details. Although Dineo didn’t respond to claims she was suspended or talk to the media, she posted a video of herself DJing, which fans assumed was a response. The caption to the video read: “The same boiling water that hardens the egg softens the potato.” She also announced that she’d be releasing her first single on Friday, 28 January. “We recorded this song I think June last year ... there couldn’t be a better time to release it! All of my being is excited about my music/DJ journey in this season of my life. Ayikhale,” she wrote.
