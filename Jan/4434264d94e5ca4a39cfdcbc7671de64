KAIZER Chiefs’ versatile youngster Happy Mashiane reckons it’s high time they rediscovered their touch in cup competitions. Amakhosi, dubbed the “Cup Kings” of South African football in their heydays, have been anything but in recent seasons as they continue to endure a long trophy drought, with their last being league title in the 2014-15 season. The league title might be out of their reach this season with Mamelodi Sundowns poised to make it five in a row as they boast a 14-point lead at the summit. But the Nedbank Cup could be a more realistic target for the Soweto giants who are desperate to end their six year trophy drought. They have been drawn against the familiar opposition of TS Galaxy in the Round of 32, presenting them with an opportunity to avenge arguably their most embarrassing defeat in the 2019 final. Although Chiefs are the most successful team in the Ke Yona Cup, recent memories in the competition haven’t been the best. In addition to their heartbreaking loss in the 2019 final to little known Galaxy at the time, Amakhosi suffered an early exit at the hands of less fancied Richards Bay last season. Mashiane insists they are eager to erase those unpleasant memories and replace them with happier ones this season. “It is our objective to win the Nedbank Cup,” Mashiane told his club’s official website. “We have a challenging draw against TS Galaxy, but we will work hard. We did not do well in the competition last season and we are looking to do better this season.”
