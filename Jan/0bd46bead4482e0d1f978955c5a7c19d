THE Mseleku wives have gone into TV presenting. Reality TV stars Bulisiwe “MaCele”, Nokukhanya “MaYeni”, Thobile “MaKhumalo” and Mbali “MaNgwabe” Mseleku will be hosting a new show on SABC1 called Igumbi Lamakhosikazi. The show, which starts airing on 7 February, will give viewers advice about their personal lives. Speaking to Daily Sun, MaYeni said: “This is a show that talks about things that are happening to everyone, married or not. “We also touch on things that happen in relationships at home and talk about children. We will really be touching on everything we know people at home need advice on. “We’ll discuss these issues and we will share our thoughts about them.” MaYeni said fans of their Mzansi Magic reality show Uthando Nesthembu inspired the new show. “People who have been following us since it started are always sending us messages asking for advice. It doesn’t only happen to me but to the other wives as well. ALSO READ: BUST BRINGS JOY FOR REALITY TV STAR “Sometimes it’s about marriages and sometimes general questions about other problems. We felt responding online only helps the person who asked, but a TV show will help a lot of people.” MaYeni said viewers would take away a lot from the show. “We chose to talk about things people go through in real life because we wanted to reach out to other people out there, not just the people who reach out to us. “It’s also great that there are four of us because people won’t just get the opinion of one. We’re four different women from different backgrounds and don’t think the same. Sometimes we agree and sometimes we disagree. It will benefit the people watching.”
