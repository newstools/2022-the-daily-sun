ON Friday, 28 January, two men were shot dead in Mfuleni, Cape Town, while waiting for their other friend. Now their families want to know who killed them. Simthembile Poni (22) and his friend Malakhiwe Menu (24) were waiting for their friend when suspects in a silver VW Polo started shooting at them, killing them on the spot. Simthembile’s father Richard Poni said they were devastated and were struggling to accept his death. “I was told they were accompanying their friend who was taking clothes to his baby mama in the other side of the kasi. He got inside and while they waited for him outside, that was when a silver Polo came and started shooting and killing both of them.” They have been left with so many questions. “I just want the killers to tell me why they killed my son. What did he do to them?” Richard asked. Malakhiwe’s father Zuzekile Menu still thought his son would come home. “It feels like a bad dream. Somewhere in my mind I still believe he will come home just like he used to do,” he said.  Malakhiwe was doing his third year at Cape Peninsula of Technology. “He was studying to a paramedic and we were looking forward to seeing him graduate. We never expected this but it happened and there is nothing we can do about it.” Zuzekile never thought he would bury his son. “As parents, our wish is to be buried by our children, not the other way around. Our children are dying like flies every day and it is sad,” he said. The three men had been friends since primary school. “The three of them grew up together and we still believe their lives were taken away too early. We were looking forward to seeing them grow,” said Zuzekile. A resident said maybe the suspects wanted to kill all three of them. “The third one was just lucky he was still inside his baby mama’s house when the suspects arrived. Maybe the plan was to kill them all as they are friends,” said the resident.
