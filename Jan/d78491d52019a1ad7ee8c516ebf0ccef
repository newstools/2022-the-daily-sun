KAIZER
Chiefs assistant coach Arthur Zwane has given an update on the recovery of
Lebogang Manyama and Samir Nurlopvic, who missed the first round due to long
term injuries. Nurkovic
underwent surgery on his groin in September last year, and he was expected to
return in November. Zwane has
revealed that the Serbian striker "coming up well" could be back to
boost Amakhosi when the league second round resume in February. Manyama was
forced to restart rehabilitation after suffering a relapse from his recent
injury. Talking to
the club media department midweek, Zwane said: "So far, so good, in terms
of the response from the boys. "It
has not been easy because we come back from a situation. Getting about 10 to 12
days of rest, spending time with our families allowed us to reflect. Zwane
admitted that the second round would be more demanding. Chiefs will be
competing in the League and Nedbank Cup competition when the campaign resumes
in February. Zwane
added: "Coming back this year, and the second round of the league games,
it is going to be demanding. In our six training days, the boys look good, even
those coming back from an injury like Samir (Nurkovic). He is coming up well.
Lebo also looks good. "From
the sessions, the boys have responded positively and we are looking forward to
the games. We are going to be in camp for about 11 days, if not 12 days.
Hopefully we are not going to experience some bad injuries in the camp and that
we will have everyone available by the time we play our Nedbank Cup game." Chiefs were
drawn against TS Galaxy in the Nedbank Cup last-32.
