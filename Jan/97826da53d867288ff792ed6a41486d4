A FORMER senior health official from the Gauteng Department of Health was accused of not showing concern during the deaths of Life Esidimeni mental health patients. Retired Hannah Jacobus, who held the position of deputy director of mental health at the time of the Marathon Project, returned to the witness stand before the Life Esidimeni Inquest on Thursday, 20 January. She was cross-examined by Advocate Phyllis Vorster, who is representing four families related to the victims. It’s understood that the four victims were moved from Cullinan Care and Rehabilitation Centre, where they had been cared for to Siyabadinga NGO, which operates on the same premises, to make space for Life Esidimeni patients. According to the families’ testimonies, patients’ health deteriorated while at Siyabadinga and they were later returned to Cullinan Care and Rehabilitation Centre and shortly died. Vorster said the movement led to their deaths and asked Jacobus why were patients moved to Siyabadinga. She said she wasn’t aware of the existence of Siyabadinga until a later stage when the deaths occurred. ALSO READ |

Vorster said Jacobus was not concerned. However, Jacobus said this was because she spent less time at the office, hence she could not keep track of the number of deaths that kept occurring. The hearing also heard that Jacobus was physically involved in transporting sickly patients transferred to NGOs to hospitals on a daily basis. Asked what was wrong with the patients, Jacobus said she could only remember two patients, of which one was HIV positive and the other had suffered heart failure.
