THE Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations has denied the murder of its general secretary Cecil Dibela was related to taxi violence. Its spokesman Andile Khanyi said the incident, which took place at Monwabisi Beach in Cape Town, on Monday 17 January, left everyone shocked. “I heard people were suggesting it might be connected to taxi violence but it wasn’t. We‘ll wait for the police to tell us what happened.” The murder happened just six months after warring taxi associations signed a peace pact brokered by the provincial government. Transport MEC Daylin Mitchell said he was saddened by the death of Dibela, who was also the SA national taxi association’s deputy chairman in the province. “I had been working very closely with Mr Dibela in dealing with challenges facing the taxi industry. He formed part of leadership delegations I have been engaging in my effort to end taxi violence,” he said. He described Dibela as a firm leader who was dedicated to changing the industry’s image. Mitchell called on cops and other law enforcement officers to work around the clock to bring Dibela’s killers to book. Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said Harare police attended to the crime scene. “Upon arrival, they found the body of a man next to the road with gunshot wounds to the head. The victim was declared deceased at the scene by medical personnel. The motive for the attack was taxi related.” Anyone with information’s urged to call CrimeStop on 0800 10111.
