BEFORE he kicked a ball for Bafana Bafana, Hans Vonk was labelled by a section of the media as a “palooka”. However, this gentle giant proved not just to be one of the best goalkeepers to represent his country of birth, but became a guardian angel to many kids at the SOS Village in Mamelodi. Vonk, who was born in Alberton but grew up in Holland and played for Heerenveen in the Dutch Eredivisive, answered his critics by making the number one jersey his own during and after the 1998 World Cup in France. Few will know the story when Vonk showed he had a heart of gold when he donated R10 000 of his match fee in March 1999, after helping Bafana beat Gabon 4-1 the previous month. So touched was Vonk at what he saw when the Bafana squad visited the Children’s Village prior to that Afcon qualifier against Gabon that he wrote to the SA Football Association (Safa), telling the association to deduct R10 000 from his match fee and donate it to this special charity. Vonk did not want any publicity and quietly donated this sizable sum without any fanfare which made his gesture that more special. But then Safa CEO Raymond Hack decided to make the donation from this unsung hero public. Said Hack at the time: “It is an incredible gesture and one that is deeply appreciated. “It shows what sort of commitment some of our international stars have to the development and well-being of others not as fortunate.” Vonk played 43 times for Bafana. He made his debut in May 1998 in the 1-1 home draw against Zambia. But the Holland based Vonk was not impressed a year later when he was called up for a friendly against Sweden at Loftus Versfeld Stadium, only to sit on the bench the entire match. Vonk, in an interview after the game, told me: “I don’t mind sitting on the bench. “But why did Safa waste their money by flying me from Holland when the coach could have selected a promising young local keeper to sit on the bench and save paying for an air ticket from Holland?”
