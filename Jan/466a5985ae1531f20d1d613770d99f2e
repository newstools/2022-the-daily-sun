OUTGOING Maritzburg United striker, Bongokuhle Hlongwane, will say his goodbyes to the club before his departure to the United States to join Minnesota United. But there might be a delay in departing the country for the budding Bafana Bafana star, with Maritzburg United chairman Farook Kadodia saying “everything is beyond our control” when asked exactly when Hlongwane will leave the country. Hlongwane was signed by the Loons on a three-year contract, with a one-year option to renew with the MLS team earlier this month. As an international player, Hlongwane was the club’s first U-22 initiative signing and will join Minnesota pending a physical and receipt of his P1 Visa and ITC (international transfer certificate). He will occupy an international spot on Minnesota’s roster (squad), according to the club. However, it doesn’t seem like it’s all system go for the 21-year-old to start his new journey, because he’s still sorting out his work permit and visa issues with Minnesota. “He’ll be bidding his farewell with us by the weekend, but the process (departing to US) is out of our hands,” said Kadodia. “His work permit and all that (other documents) are in America and that is beyond our control.” Hlongwane, who made his PSL debut for Maritzburg under coach Eric Tinkler on 24 April 2019, featured in 56 games for the Team of Choice and scored eight goals along with seven assists. Meanwhile, Kadodia said coach Ernst Middendorp “will be the driving force in the project” after the club signed a partnership with Germany Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld. Middendorp has struggled this season and there was speculation he was on his way out. But the German-born tactician convinced management he could turn around the club’s fortunes at a meeting held earlier this month. Kadodia added: “I don’t think we should be short-sighted. We should be looking at the situation where we know that as long as the coach stays here, we know that his value is important.”
