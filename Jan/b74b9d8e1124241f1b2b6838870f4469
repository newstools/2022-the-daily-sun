THE community and parents of pupils at the Elukhanyisweni Secondary School are calling for the Department of Basic Education to take action against a teacher and clerk. The two were allegedly caught stealing food intended for the school’s nutrition programme on Monday, 24 January. They were found in the afternoon by community members who were passing by the school in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. A community member told Daily Sun that they confronted the teacher and clerk. “We found them loading maize meal, milk and other items. We asked where they were taking them, but they couldn’t tell us.” He said they gave different explanations, making it clear they were taking the food for themselves. “Children from disadvantaged backgrounds rely on this food. If the school’s staff takes it then it’s a problem. The department must punish them. We cannot allow thieves in our schools,” he said. Another community member Sizwe Buthelezi said they would be meeting with the department. “How can you take something that is not yours? What they did was very wrong,” he said. Department spokesman Jasper Zwane said they were waiting for a report from the district and would then know what action to take. Another community member said they wanted the department to take action. They said they had not yet reported the matter to cops as they wanted the department to deal with it. He said this is not the first incident where staff allegedly stole food. It was alleged that sometimes, they sold the food, stationery and donated items to the community.
