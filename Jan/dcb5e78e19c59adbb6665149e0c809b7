IT’S time to stop judging people who take drugs and calling them names such as makhula ka nzima, mgresto and amaphara. This is according to Clara Monnakgotla (49), a community developer and trainer at the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca). “Let us help and give them the necessary support,” she said. “They have a right to dignity and acceptance to treatment,” she said. The community builder from Braamfischerville in Soweto said drug treatment was voluntary, unless ordered by the courts when a person could harm themselves. There are 31 Sanca centres in nine provinces where people can come for help. Clara said substance abuse could lead to unplanned pregnancies, Aids, crime, road accidents, mental disorders, death and chronic diseases. She started working for Sanca in 1998 as a volunteer while still at university. After she graduated in public administration and management, she joined it full-time in 2004. “This is where I developed my way of helping people to change,” she said. Clara, who is a member of the International Society of Substance Use Professionals, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America and Colombo Plan Drug Advisory Programme, said her job made her insightful and improved her knowledge about substance use disorder. “For harm reduction, I refer to behaviour change and demand reduction, basically prevention and awareness campaigns,” she said. Clara has appealed to the community to report people who are battling substance abuse to them. “Otherwise this will affect the whole family and community,” she said. She said due to the coronavirus, they encouraged people with substance use disorders to strictly stick to general Covid-19 precautions.
