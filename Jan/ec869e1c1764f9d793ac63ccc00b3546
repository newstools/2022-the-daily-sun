THE ANC January 8 celebrations got underway at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium amid security concerns in Polokwane. This was after a week of activities that led to some events being cancelled. Only 2,000 people were allowed inside the stadium as in keeping with lockdown regulations and as the official programme started supporters inside the stadium were encouraged to social distance.  The programme director warned that they were advised that the event was not complying with regulations. President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived to a warm welcome with Police Minister Bheki Cele telling journalists on the sidelines of the event that the power blackout at the gala dinner during Ramaphosa’s speech was an act of sabotage. Cele told journalists that somebody deliberately switched off the power and police were investigating. A heavy police contingent has been deployed to the stadium amidst security concerns with officers blocking more than required numbers of people allowed into the stadium in keeping with lockdown regulations. This led to other followers having a parallel celebrations outside the stadium with their cooler bags. Inside the stadium, proceedings were continuing with alliance partners delivering their messages of support before Ramaphosa delivered the main speech.
