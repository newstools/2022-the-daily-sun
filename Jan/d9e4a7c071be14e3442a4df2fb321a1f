ALTHOUGH it was tough when she started, Lebohang Dhludhlu is excited about her future as a farmer. The 32-year-old from Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun the poultry business had its challenges but it was her passion and nothing would stop her. She has a farm in Badplaas where she has 3 800 chickens. She said it was not easy when she started in 2019, as 500 chickens died during heavy rain, leaving her with 700, some of which were not doing well. “The main challenge was venturing into poultry without much knowledge of it. It took me almost six months to know about chickens,” she said. Lebohang said her chickens did not make much noise as long as they were given enough water, food and proper accommodation. The mother of two said since she started her business, she’s been able to support her family. She said every six weeks, new chicks came in to replace the ones she sold. Lebohang, who is studying sustainable agriculture at University of the Free State, said farming was her first love. “There is life in farming as long as you work hard,” she said. She appealed to women to get into farming as it empowers them. She also appealed to government to invest in farming. Lebohang said in the future, she would love to start a chicken spice business. So far, she has employed four permanent workers and eight resellers. Her husband Dumisane (39) said chickens were a good business. “I have realised there is a shortage of chickens in South Africa and decided to be part of the poultry business. This business is interesting and makes me feel happy,” he said.
