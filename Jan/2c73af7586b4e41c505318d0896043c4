A CAPE Town cop is in hot water after he allegedly shot and killed a homeless man in Rondebosch on Saturday, 8 January. A resident called the police after homeless people started a fire on Chester Road, where they were cooking food. When law enforcement arrived, they apparently ordered the homeless people to put it out, but they refused, saying they were still cooking. This led to a fight that saw one of them allegedly being shot in the face and dying. A resident told the SunTeam he was shocked the matter escalated as quickly as it did. “I passed by the scene when officers were ordering the homeless people to extinguish their fire. They always make fire on the street, it was not really a new thing so I did not bother to stop. I was however shocked when I heard gunshots and later learnt one of the homeless people was shot and killed” The City of Cape Town confirmed the incident and said it would let the law take its course. “The city can confirm a shooting incident involving a law enforcement officer. The matter is being investigated by SAPS and enquiries should be directed to them. The city views the incident in a very serious light and will co-operate with the investigation, where needed,” it said in response to a Daily Sun query. Colonel Andre Traut said a 22-year-old cop was arrested. “Rondebosch police are investigating the circumstances surrounding a murder, following an incident where a 38- year-old homeless man was shot and killed on Sunday morning at about 10am in Chester Road, Rondebosch. The suspect, a 22-year-old officer, was arrested and is expected to make his court appearance in Wynberg on a charge of murder,” said Traut.
