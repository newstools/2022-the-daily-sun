Equatorial Guinea have booked their spot in the knockout stages of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). This after they overcame a spirited Sierra Leone 1-0 at the Limbe Omnisport Stadium yesterday in what was essentially a knockout match. Pablo Ganet was the hero of the day for Equatorial Guinea as he bagged the winner in the first half to send his side to the next round. Equatorial Guinea will also be grateful to their goalkeeper Jesus Owono who produced a heroic penalty save from Kei Kamara at the death. The National Thunder, as Equatorial Guinea are known, were able to hold on for dear and will now march on to the next round with plenty of optimism. The Leone Stars, on the other hand, are forced to pack up their bags and head home despite putting on a brave effort in a tough Group E. They came into the game high in confidence having come from behind twice to snatch a 2-2 draw against Ivory Coast last in their last match. But they could not replicate those heroics as they were defeated by a more determined team on the day in Equatorial Guinea. The Leone Stars will take some solace from the fact that they finished above defending champions Algeria. The Algerians had a terrible tournament, failing to win even a single game as they lost twice and drew once. The Group winners Ivory Coast put the final nail in Algeria’s coffin with a 3-1 win in their final match. Equatorial Guinea, on the other hand, will hope to ride the momentum of their impressive run in the group stages in the knockout stages. Their win over the Leone Stars was the first since 2008 having come short in their last three meetings.
