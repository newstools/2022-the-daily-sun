Dear MizzB I’M in love with a 35-year-old woman who I suspect is now seeing someone else. She asked for a break after her baby daddy died, but they were no longer together. She said she’s performing rituals because according to her culture, she’s mourning. She also doesn’t answer her phone, especially on Wednesday and Sunday nights. I hate this as my previous marriage ended because of cheating. I planned to get engaged but have put that on hold. Dear Anonymous Suspecting your partner is unfaithful can’t be easy. You sound angry she isn’t being open with you about what she gets up to when she’s not with you. It’ll be helpful to ask for clarity as to what motivated her to want space and what she expects from you. It would also help for you to get more insight into her culture.
