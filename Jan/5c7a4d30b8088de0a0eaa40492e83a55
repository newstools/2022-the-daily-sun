ON the morning of 8 December, Joseph Mhlongo (59) got up, took a bath, got dressed and went outside. His family thought he was sitting outside as usual, but when they went to look for Joseph, who is mentally ill, he was nowhere to be found. Joseph from Ntshongweni Mission near Hammarsdale has not been seen since. His daughter Thandeka Mhlongo (21) told Daily Sun after realising that her father wasn’t at home, they started searching for him but didn’t find him. She said he was dark of complexion and tall. “My father was wearing cream trousers, a white cap, white shoes and a red white jacket. “Nobody saw him leave the house. “Even the neighbours didn’t see him,” she said. “He is mentally disturbed and this is the first time he has gone missing. “We contacted the hospital and went to taxi ranks but we can’t find him. “We also reported him to Mpumalanga Police Station.” She said if anyone saw him they should please contact her on 065 322 9173. She said their December holidays were bitter. “It’s now going to be a month without finding him. I’m so hurt as I wonder where he might be and what he is eating. “I’m sure he is also wondering where we are as he can’t see us,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the family opened a missing persons case. “Investigations regarding his whereabouts are ongoing,” said Mbele.
