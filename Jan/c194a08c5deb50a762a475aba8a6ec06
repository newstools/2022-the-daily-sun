TENSION is mounting as pupils and parents at Tirelong Secondary School have barricaded roads connecting the school to the N4 route. Instead of moving their children to a neighbouring school, parents demand that the provincial department of education provide them with mobile classrooms. The Glencore mine in the area has sent private security officers to monitor the protest on the R104 road in Kroondal, near Rustenburg. At least five times, parts of the North West school have been vandalised, with the most recent resulting in the theft of electric cables, taps, roofing, books, window frames, and doors. #WATCH Learners at Tirelong Secondary school near Rustenburg in the North West have taken their frustrations to the streets as their school remains closed after it was vandalized.
