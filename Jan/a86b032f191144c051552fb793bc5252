THE discovery of a burnt body on Monday morning, 24 January has left a community in fear. Residents of Windmill Park, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun crime was on the rise and they were scared for their children. The body was found near a taxi rank and no one knew what had happened. However, residents told the SunTeam it was not the first time a burnt body had been found. They said last month, another body was found and two months before that, a girl’s body was found. A resident (39) told the People’s Paper: “I have a teenage daughter who is unruly and always wants to go out at night. “Even though I try to stop her, she goes out anyway and I fear one day, I will get a call to say something horrible has happened to her.” Another resident (36) said she was recently mugged right in front of her house. “We need police to intervene and we need community members to work with them to end crime in our area,” she said. A 56-year-old said she was afraid of attending night vigils in the area. “Neighbours think I have a bad attitude but I’m getting old and my remaining years are precious to me. I can’t take risks.” Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said Dawn Park cops registered an inquest docket. “The unidentified body was burned beyond recognition. “The circumstances that led to this gruesome discovery are unknown at this stage and police are investigating,” she said.
