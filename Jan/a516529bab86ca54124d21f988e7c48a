POPULAR media personality Bonang Matheba has won the defamatory case that she had opened against podcaster Rea Gopane. In 2021 in his podcast Everything SA Music TV, Rea claimed that Bonang introduced AKA to cocaine. But soon after that, he released an apology to Bonang and AKA in the form of a video. Bonang, however, went ahead and took him to court. According to the legal letter, she wanted R500 000 to be paid within 10 days, but tweeted on Friday, 28 January, that Rea had been ordered by the South Gauteng High Court to pay her R300 000 plus legal costs. In part, her statement read: “It is with a great deal of humanity that I acknowledge and welcome the vindicating and ground-breaking ruling by Judge Gcina Malindi on 27 January. Following false and defamatory attacks on my reputation by a certain Rea, and only after two written requests to desist which were ignored, I instituted an action for compensatory damages in court.” She added that the court ruled that Rea must pay R300 000, but it was not yet clear how the money would be paid or when. Bonang said her intention was to teach a lesson through Rea. “It is not my intention to benefit financially from the ruling. Rather, I wish to uplift those less fortune than me. And I will be donating the damages received to my philanthropic endeavour, the Bonang Matheba Foundation,” she said. The statement further said the judgment should serve as a lesson to people that there are consequences for abusing public platforms to defame and humiliate others. Right after the statement, Rea took to Twitter, commenting: “I don’t have time for delusional women. Back to work.”
