PARENTS want the education department to intervene after pupils who don’t have blazers were allegedly chased away from school. A parent, who has a child at Mgezwa High School in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, said: “We were never told about this. We were shocked after our kids were sent home and told they should come to school when they have blazers.” She said education was more important than blazers. “We send our kids to school to learn. We understand the importance of wearing a school uniform but not having a blazer shouldn’t be the end of the world,” said the parent. Parent Nolonwabo Jiko (54) said they were unemployed and were stressed about getting school uniforms. “We don’t have money for blazers at the moment but we will buy them when we can. “Some of us borrowed money to buy school uniforms. Where are we expected to get money now? Our kids are stressing over blazers,” said Nolonwabo. Another parent said if the department didn’t intervene soon, things could escalate into something bad. “We are not people who believe in protesting but if the school continues treating us like this we will do what other people are doing to be heard,” said the resident. Eastern Cape education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the parents must make arrangements with the school and explain when they would buy school uniforms. “No one has the right to chase pupils away,” he said.
