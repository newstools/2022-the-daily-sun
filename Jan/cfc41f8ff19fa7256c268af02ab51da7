PEOPLE ran for cover as a gang of robbers armed with AK47s and pistols hit the Ximhungwe Post Office on Tuesday, 4 January. The drama unfolded a few minutes after cash guards dropped off cash for Sassa grant payments at the post office in Ireagh outside Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. This is the second time the post office has been hit. A resident said they were in the queue when they saw a white Ford Ranger and a silver BMW speeding onto the premises. “A VW Polo was parked just outside. An argument broke out between a security guard and a thug who forced his way into the post office building saying he wanted to certify papers. “Gang members disarmed the guard and forced people to lie down. They went in and assaulted staff members before robbing them of the money,” he said. He said a few minutes later the gang came running out with the money bags and started shooting randomly. Another resident said: “Four armed thugs were standing next to the satellite police station near the railway line bridge, ready to engage the police officers had they tried to intervene.” As the thugs fled, a high speed chase with police ensued. The bakkie hit a tree stump and burst its tyres. They hijacked a Nissan Sentra at gunpoint. But police got to them and they ran into the nearby bushes on foot. One was arrested a few kilometres away fleeing in a BMW. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed a man (28) in possession of an unlicenced gun was arrested. He said: “Employees at the post office were on duty when a group of about 10 armed men attacked. A preliminary investigation showed the Ford Ranger was hijacked at Masoyi near White River.” Post office spokesman Johan Kruger said the employees were not seriously injured and were receiving trauma counselling.
