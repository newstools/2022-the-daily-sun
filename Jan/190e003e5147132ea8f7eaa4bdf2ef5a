NATIONAL Arts Council’s (NAC) motivational message has been met with criticism. The government institution shared tips on how to stay motivated as an artist. Part of the motivational reads: “Tips on how to stay motivated as an artist. Seek input from others. Create space in your schedule for your craft. Revisit your favourite artist, share your creative purposes, read at books daily, make money with your art, set goals.” But artists made it clear that the NAC’s motivational tips were not welcomed. Choreographer Musa Hlatshwayo posted: “What nonsense is this? This is offensive in so many levels. We aren’t kindergartens kids. We are creatives. Some of us have degrees in human psychology as part of our academic qualifications, and this right here is not right. Please remove this.” ALSO READ : PEARL THUSI AND MR SMEG TO GO ON A DATE! Jackie Rens described the motivation as an insult. Jackie wrote:” Please fire your content creator. It is downright insulting to artists.” Mukendi Tshimanga posted: “After declining our applications and coming with sick depression.” For sometime, the NAC has been at loggerheads with the artists. Last year hundreds of artists applied for relief fund but most of them were declined. Instead, several companies which had nothing to do with the creative industry received the funding. A forensic report by the Department of Sport Arts and Culture, as well as the public protector proved that there was mismanagement of public funds.
