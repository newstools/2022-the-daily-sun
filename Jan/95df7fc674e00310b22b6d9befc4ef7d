THEY were starting to come to terms with the death of their loved one. Little did they know that they were about to bury the wrong body. A family from Ohio, USA, was recently left stunned after opening their loved one’s casket for a final goodbye, only to find the body of a stranger inside. According to Insider.com, the family of the late Sonya White (51) made the gruesome discovery on 10 January. “When we walked in there, it was a different body in her casket. We wanted closure, but that is not something we will ever get. I have never, in my life, seen something like this before,” the deceased’s cousin told the publication. The family reportedly told ABC 6news that the funeral parlour had apologised, and promised to pay for the funeral services because of the mix-up. Insider.com reported that Marlan Gary Funeral Home had not responded for comment.
