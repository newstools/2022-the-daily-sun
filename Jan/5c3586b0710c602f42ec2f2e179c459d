Right now, I don’t know what to do and I have no idea who might have done this. I don’t have beef with anyone,” he said. Vuthela said the incident caused a setback with his work. He said he has been finishing tracks, which were lost. He said there were also studio bookings from local artists he had to cancel. “I am not working and I’m losing money at the same time. “I am stuck and the bookings were going to boost me financially,” he said. Vuthela discovered and produced well-known artists Sico-T and Smition. He also worked with DJs Bobo and Mbuzana from Ikwekwezi FM. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed the incident and said a case of burglary was opened. He said no arrests were made and cops were investigating.
