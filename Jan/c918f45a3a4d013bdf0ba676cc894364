DJ and YFM presenter Kea Zawadi has scored her first lead role in a TV show. She will be starring in SABC1’s new romantic comedy series, 13 Weeks To Find Mr Right starting 6 February. It stars Didintle Khunou, Lerato Mvelase, Mohau Cele, Monnye Kunupi and The Wife actor, Bonko Khoza. Kea (25), who was born and raised in Klerksdorp, North West told SunBuzz the rom-com will be fun to watch. “It is a beautifully written show and I play Nkuli who is tired of putting other people before herself. She’s a journalist and she’s in a place where she thinks she hasn’t figured her life out. “She gets to a point where she wants to start over again. “In a desperate attempt to save her job, she agrees to write an anonymous dating column to prove she can find Mr Right in 13 weeks, but ends up falling for one of her dates, Zakhele. She tries not to fall in love with him because he’s not her type.” ALSO READ : MASTERMIND BRINGS BAFANA TO LIFE! Kea urged Mzansi people to watch the show. “People must be glued to their screens and they will enjoy the series. Viewers will laugh a lot and there’s a lot of emotion. People will relate to a lot that’s happening on the show. It’ll show people the beauty of love and the challenges it comes with.” Sharing her journey, she said: “I fell in love with acting while I was a child. I’d watch a lot of TV, then go in front of a mirror and re-enact the scenes I saw. I started acting in primary school because teachers would make me perform on school shows and concerts. In high school, I was fortunate enough to go to a school that offered drama as a subject. “But I studied something else when I got to university. Even though I didn’t study acting, it always followed me, just like it has now. My first TV role was a cameo on Inconceivable on M-Net and a movie called No Hiding Here. “Now I am on this show,” she said. Catch 13 Weeks To Find Mr. Right on SABC1, on Sundays at 7.30pm from 6 February.
