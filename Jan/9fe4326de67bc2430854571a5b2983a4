FORMER Bafana Bafana midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo is on the verge of re-joining Dutch side FC Twente. FC Twente technical Jan Streuer told Dutch website Tubantia that they will medically examine the player on Thursday before they decide whether to sign him or not. The 30-year-old is currently without a club after his contract with Major League Soccer club FC Cincinnati was terminated in November last year. If signed, this will be his second spell with FC Twente having joined the club in 2014 and left them to play for Premier League side Brentford in 2017 while they were still campaigning in the Championship.  He then joined FC Cincinnati in 2020. "We are in no rush (to sign him) because he has no contract (with another club). We're going to take a look at it calmly, " Said Streuer. Streuer says the technical staff will assess how Mokotjo will fit into their system since they have Ramiz Zerrouki, Michal Sadilek and Wout Brama who play in a similar role. "But we don't know how they will go with a view to next season, that remains to be seen. Mokotjo is a good player, and we will now see how fit he is," concluded Streuer
