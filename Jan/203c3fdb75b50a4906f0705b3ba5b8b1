KHULANI Phiri says he has always loved tattoos and helping people decorate their bodies. The 24-year-old tattoo artist and musician, based in Protea Glen extension 12 in Soweto, said seeing his clients happy made him feel fulfilled. Khulani, originally from Matatiele in the Eastern Cape, started Mamba Ink Tattoos in 2019. “Making tattoos and doing music are the two things I love most, so I make sure I sacrifice for them. “I work six days a week, from Monday to Saturday. “ On Sundays, I put my energy into recording songs and promoting my music,” he said. Khulani said he has been a tattoo artist for eight years. “My love of art motivated me to do tattoos. “I believe without art, we are nothing. It gives meaning to our lives.” Khulani said people complimented his work all the time because he provided nothing but quality. “Some of the tattoos have meaning, but some people just want something artistic. I feel blessed to be doing this because it’s exactly what I wanted to do for a long time.” Khulani said he has a music studio on the same premises as his tattoo parlour. He said he hoped to see the business grow so he could employ more people. He has so far employed one person. Speaking about his music career, Khulani said he released a number of EPs in 2019, including 100 Favours, Okuhle, Push Through the Pain and Piece of me.
