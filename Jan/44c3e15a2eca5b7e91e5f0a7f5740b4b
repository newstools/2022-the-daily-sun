FROM the time the kidnapped Moti brothers were found in November of 2021, the family has refused to co-operate with the police. The family has now filed an interdict barring cops from speaking to the kids, who’ve reportedly been relocated to Dubai, making the police’s job even more difficult. National police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Netshiunda told Daily Sun: “If we were given a chance to work on the case, maybe we could have got some leads. They never co-operate.” The family has reportedly said speaking to cops would just traumatise the children again. “When those kids were found, if we were not stopped, we would have taken them to a medical institution where they were going to be evaluated by experts,” said Netshiunda. “We were also supposed to take their clothes to the laboratory for investigation to check if we could find any clues. “None of this was done because the father and the family were not co-operating. “To say children are traumatised, it must be a report from the experts.” Netshiunda said despite the Motis not co-operating, investigations would continue and they hoped the parents would change their minds. “We are hoping for their co-operation as the police and we will do what we have to do to ensure we investigate the case. “But with reports that they have moved to Dubai, we don’t know how that is going to work out,” he said. The boys were kidnapped in Polokwane in October 2021. Zia (15), Alaan (13), Zayyad (11) and Zidan (7) were on their way to school when seven armed men blocked the vehicle they were travelling in and fired shots. The men were in a black Mercedes-Benz and a white KIA.
