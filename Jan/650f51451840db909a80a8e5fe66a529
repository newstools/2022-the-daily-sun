This is a competition for up-and-coming presenters. The person must be teachable and be willing to learn. People will send their demos and the public will have to listen and vote for them.” “We’re not necessarily focusing on gender or qualifications, but talent. We’ll also happily take more than one presenter if there’s a compelling reason to do so,” he said. One of the station’s hosts, Jacinta Ngobese, also went live on Facebook and gave some tips on how to do a demo for presenting.

You also need to decide how long your demo is going to be. It shouldn’t be over two minutes,” she said. Jacinta said radio programme managers listen to hundreds of demos and voices. “You need to give them something that sets you apart from the rest. But you must also not try too hard, just keep it simple, don’t be too much and try to sound like someone else,” she said. Jacinta described radio as “theatre of the mind”. She said: “As a presenter you need to resonate with the listeners. You must know who you are talking to, know the age group of the radio. You must also remember that when you’re on radio, you always talk to a single person and not to a crowd. “Know what the radio station is about, know and understand its culture.”
