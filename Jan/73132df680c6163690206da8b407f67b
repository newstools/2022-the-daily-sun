American sexologist, Shan Boodram claims men come 'flocking' to her when she wears her vagina scent as a perfume. On her new book The Game of Desire with Refinery29, Shan Boodram was surprised by just how much attention her "delicious scent" attracted. Shan asked three of her clients to see if coplulins - which are chemicals secreted by the vagina - would also "attract anyone traditionally attracted to women with vulvas" if used as perfume. She wrote: "I instructed them to wash their hands, get in a stall and then move their finger around their vaginal opening. The goal was to get a sample from the Bartholin's glands, which are the size of a pea but play a large role in vaginal lubrication". Sadly, Shan's clients said that they didn't have much success with men than beforehand, only noting that a few leaned in a little closer, which could have been to do with the background noise but the expert she's still unsure of how effective this method actually is, the author concluded: "I am certain that every single time I employ it, it makes me feel like an enchanted goddess with a delicious scent..." What are your thoughts on vabbing ??? Yesterday a story about me using my vaginal fluids as perfume circulated the Internet and was translated into several languages. Naturally there were questions that I tried to answer here! You can also read the excerpt of my book published on @refinery29 by clicking the link in my bio ??
