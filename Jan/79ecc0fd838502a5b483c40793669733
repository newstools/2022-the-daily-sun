FEATURING kwaito artist Mampintsha in a track is something many aspiring artists wish for. However, this wish will not come true for an artist with a small bank balance. The 39-year-old Durban-based artist, whose real name is Mandla Maphumulo, has announced any artist who wants him to feature in a track will have to cough up R100 000. If they want him to dance, it will cost an extra R20 000. The former Big Nuz vocalist made this announcement recently on various social media platforms, including Instagram. “I have been getting a lot of calls from people who want to work with me, so I have a solution for you. I come with a song, I teach you how to sing, how to make your voice sound good and we do a music video and promotion,” he said.

Some thought he was asking too little while others said he was blocking up-and-coming artists from working with him. Misasen_arts said: “Yoo-but then I feel sorry for up-and-coming artists who wish to work with you because there’s no up-and-coming artist that would have this kind of money.” Sitabonga_071 said: “You’re really making money Mampintsha.” Mrbuhoso commented: “That means we must just forget.” Nkanyisoka ESA said: “Shimora people from ekasi wish to work with you but they don’t have this kind of money.” Knmlambo said: “Ha ha ha, this very cheap considering that you just sit and do nothing.” Mampintsha’s manager SBI Ncube said recording a song was expensive and people didn’t understand the music business. “Artists must just understand that Mampintsha is worth this much. But there’s always a room for negotiations,” he said.
