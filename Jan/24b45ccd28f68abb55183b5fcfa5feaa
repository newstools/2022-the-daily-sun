A BATHROOM or toilet is one of the most unhygienic spaces in the world. On average, a toilet seat contains 3,2 million bacteria per square inch. Safe to say one should never keep or eat food and refreshments in the toilet, right? Well, not according to Taiwan, that has made dining in a toilet a pleasant experience. According to One Step 4ward magazine, the city of Ximending, Taipei, now has a new modern toilet restaurant that has sent social media into a frenzy. This is a restaurant, café and dessert place themed in a toilet space. The seats are real toilets, where beverages are consumed out of mini urinals and tables have toilet bowls with fake kak inside.

Visitors generally don’t need to make reservations – unless it’s on holiday at peak times. And even then, a 10-minute wait should get you a table.

Longshan Temple, one of the main temples and tourist attractions in Taipei, is a 20-minute walk from the restaurant. It opens seven days a week for lunch and dinner, from 11.30am to 10pm Monday to Tuesday, and 11am to 10.30pm during weekends.
