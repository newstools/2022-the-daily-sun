ZODWA Wabantu has said her nudity was her ancestors’ will. The dancer has responded to her ancestral calling. She posted a photo on Instagram where she was standing in the river, wearing ibhayi (a traditional cloth) and holding two horns which are believed to have belonged to goats. Her Instagram followers praised her like they praise a sangoma when they say, “Thokoza Gogo.” Speaking to Times Live, Zodwa confirmed that she had responded to the ancestral calling. But she said her nudity was her ancestors’ will. She said: “No wonder I’ve been walking around naked. They make you lose your mind in different ways. So they were taking me out of poverty and gave this kind of life so that I have my fill. They know that’s not the end of me, it’s not my purpose that I have to fulfil.” ALSO READ : TNS: I’M OFFICIALLY SINGLE! Zodwa also posted a photo of herself surrounded by goats. She told the publication she has not started the initiation yet, but she is still going through prior processes. She said during the past weekend, she was performing rituals with the aim of informing her ancestors that she has started the journey. She said she spent R34 000 on goats. Zodwa has always insisted that she loved to get laid. And this time, she said she loves sex so her ancestors must not deprive her of that chance. “I told them I want lots of money, I want to be happy. I told them with men, I don’t want to be deprived and be a bitter old woman or a sangoma if I’m going to be one. I don’t want to be angry that I can’t have sex. If they don’t like or want him then they must send another one. They should never refuse for me to be with someone. I love sex,” she said. A post shared by zodwalibram (@zodwalibram)
