PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa was whisked away by the presidential protection unit at the Lillian Ngoyi memorial lecture in Limpopo on Thursday, 6 January. According to the ANC Women’s League, this was due to people who had gained access to the venue without being screened. ANC national spokesman Pule Mabe said the president didn’t walk out of the memorial lecture, but was advised by the leadership of the ANC. When asked if the president would walk out of the venue on 8 January, ANC member Dakota Legoete said: “Just to add on the points emphasised by comrade Pule Mabe, the president left after he was advised that we were not complying with the Covid regulations. As a law-abiding leader, he had to vacate. There’s no issue of any threat, the country is still intact, we are safe in South Africa, we have a legitimate government.” He further said that nobody is under threat: “Those who are credited to come on Saturday at the main event are allowed to do so and others can join us on TV and my ANC platforms.” ANC Women’s League secretary-general Meokgo Matuba said they were not sabotaged when Ramaphosa walked out of the memorial lecture in Lebowakgomo, citing Covid-19 non-compliance as the reason. I wonder what security threat they picked up...?? Can't be Covid. Never.This year, it's either we are facing a serious national security crisis OR we are just conspiracy theorists...?? We must fasten our safety belts coz 2022 has inyawo lwemfene...?? #ANC110 https://t.co/jCoDtPXgZv  Deputy state security minister Zizi Kodwa spoke to the president before he was whisked away, and when speaking to Newzroom Afrika, he declined to comment on whether he made the call to pull the president from the event or not. News24 reported that after the abrupt ending of the meeting, a large delegation of what looked like police personnel and ANC provincial leaders gathered for a debriefing at the back of the venue.
