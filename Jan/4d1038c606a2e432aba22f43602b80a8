REALITY TV star and businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize was meant to go for auditions for Mzansi Magic’s show Umkhokha, but it did not happen. While sources claimed she had already landed a role, it is alleged production put the auditions on hold. “In fact, Shauwn had initially landed a cameo role, but things are not organised at the show at this moment. The auditions for season two have been put on hold. So that’s hard luck for Shauwn,” said the source. According to the source, Shauwn going for auditions was just meant to be respecting procedure. “The role was hers but she had to go to auditions as per protocol,” said the source.
