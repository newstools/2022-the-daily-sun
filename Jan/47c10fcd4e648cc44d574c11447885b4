 A Nigerian national was arrested after being found in possession of fake US dollars at the Harrismith taxi rank on Thursday, Free State police said. The suspect was arrested after two people lodged complaints against him.   Mophiring added the officers took the complainant to the Harrismith taxi rank where he pointed out the suspect. "When seeing the police, he tried to run but the members were too fast and apprehended him. He was taken to the police station." When they arrived at the police station, the second complainant was already there. He pointed out the suspect as the same person who also defrauded him. "The police seized 29 fake US dollar notes," Mophiring said.
