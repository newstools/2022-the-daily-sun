THE man who killed Tshegofatso Pule was cross examined by the defence on Wednesday, 26 January. Testifying in the South Gauteng High Court, Muzikayise Malephane revealed that it was agreed that the money to pay him would come from a trust fund. Malephane claimed Pule’s boyfriend Ntuthuko Shoba hired him to murder her. She was eight months pregnant when her body was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Joburg. “During one of our meetings, Shoba told me his wife received a trust fund worth R8 million,” Malephane told the court. He said after the murder in June 2020, he called Shoba but he didn’t pick up. “He later called and asked if the job was done, and I said yes. His main concern was Pule’s phone as he kept asking me about it. He didn’t tell me what his panic about the phone was about,” he said. Malephane said two days after the murder, he bumped into Shoba at a shop in Meadowlands, Soweto. “He told me he was there to buy material for a car wash he wanted to open in Dube. He called me to the side because he didn’t want his friends to know our business.” Malephane said Shoba told him he was preparing his payment of R70 000 and gave him R20 before walking off. The trial continues on Thursday 27 January.
