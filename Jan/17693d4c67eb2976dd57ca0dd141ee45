A MAN convicted of killing his wife at the graveyard in Mamafubedu near Petrus Steyn in Free State was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment by the Bethlehem Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 18 January. According to Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring, cops were called to Mamafubedu graveyard on 1 December 2021 by community members who saw the body of a woman lying among the graves. “On their arrival, they found the body with bruises and stab wounds. She was certified dead and identified by her mother as Puseletso Motaung (28). A case of murder was opened and a suspect was arrested seven days after the incident,” Mophiring said. Thabiso Motloung (40) appeared several times in court until he was found guilty. Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane said gender-based violence (GBV) crimes won’t go unpunished in the province. “I want to thank the investigating officer for ensuring that the accused finally gets his term in jail. As police, we will continue the fight against GBV internally and externally, also through our soft approach crime awareness campaigns led by the SAPS Women Network and Men for Change structures in the province,” said Motswenyane.
