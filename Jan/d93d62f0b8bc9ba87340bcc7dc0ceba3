CONSUMER Electronics Show 2022 is in full swing and BMW has
a surprise up its sleeve. The German automaker debuted an innovative colour-changing
paint scheme on its all-electric iX. It confirmed in the run-up to the show it would demonstrate
technology that changes the exterior colour of a vehicle with the touch of a
button. BMW hasn’t released more information about the paint at this
time, but a video has gone viral on social media. In the video, the iX can be seen covered in a simple shade
of dark grey but all of a sudden, it changes to white after a man standing next
to the SUV apparently activated the system. Voici la nouvelle BMW iX Flow. #cES #CES2022pic.twitter.com/oHfbLY0q45  If you didn’t know better, you’d think this video was
completely fake. According to Carscoops, car manufacturers and technology
companies debut innovative technologies and features at the show, and while
many of them hit the market, many also don’t. Taking personalisation to new heights.

offering its customers the option of colour-changing paint like this, or if it
has been developed exclusively as a technical. Up close with the new color changing BMW iX pic.twitter.com/6cnZphkdd0
