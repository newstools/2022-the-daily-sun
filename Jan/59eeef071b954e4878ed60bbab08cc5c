ZANDILE Mafe, who is accused of setting parliament on fire, says he will sue the state for wrongfully arresting him. He said this in an affidavit presented to Judge John Hlophe on Saturday, 15 January. “I maintain my innocence and I intend to initiate civil proceedings to claim damages against the state for wrongful arrest, malicious prosecution and violation of my rights to freedom and human dignity over the past 11 days or so,” his affidavit read. “I have, and continue to be, portrayed negatively in the local and international media.” Mafe said he was being treated like a terrorist, while nothing was being done to those whose responsibility it was to secure parliament. The affidavit also stated he would not be pleading guilty to the charges against him. “In this matter I intend to plead not guilty but I also do not wish to reveal my defence or explanation of plea at this stage. I’m not a terrorist,” he said. “I’m an ordinary and destitute South African like millions of my fellow citizens. Like them, I am angry about my conditions but I am not a violent man. I am also not insane.” Mafe’s lawyer Luvuyo Godla said his client was on a hunger strike but he agreed to eat after hearing his new bail application would take place on Wednesday, 19 January. He said Mafe previously refused to abandon his hunger strike. “Now that there’s some progress, we can walk out of court happy. “At least we could convince him the wheels of justice are moving,” he said. Godla challenged Mafe’s referral to a mental institution and the matter will be heard in Western Cape High Court on Tuesday, 18 January.
