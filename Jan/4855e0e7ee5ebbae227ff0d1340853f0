A MAN found himself instantly deep in debt after he was caught, literally with his pants down, in another man’s house and bed. The heartbroken husband now wants his lobola money back from the man who he found allegedly sleeping with his wife in their home. The man, who was seen in a video on social media shirtless and only wearing blue socks, offered to pay the husband the money that he demanded, but couldn’t commit on the date. It is also not clear how much the husband paid for lobola when he decided to start a family with his wife. Not in a fighting mood, the husband was seen sitting on a chair giving a serious tongue lashing to the man and his wife. ALSO READ: CALL THE COPS IF YOU SEE THIS MAN! He asked: “Do you have a wife? So you just wreck people’s homes?” He said their child is not even a year old and is already witnessing such. The husband also assured the man he would not be fighting with him as his goal was to get him to pay back the money. “I am not fighting with you. I am not going to fight with you. I want my money now – the money I paid for lobola.” He further said: “I can use a gun, but I don’t want violence in my home.” The husband took the man through the processes he went through to get his wife. “I properly took her from her family. I paid lobola. When they said they wanted something, I gave them.” The incident is said to have happened recently in Hillbrow, Joburg.
