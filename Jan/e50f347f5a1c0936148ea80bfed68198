 ORLANDO Pirates has pleaded not guilty on the misconduct charges over the scuffle involving TS Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi. This was revealed by the Premier Soccer League advocate Zola Majavu on Wednesday evening. On Tuesday last week, Majavu revealed the club was officially charged for the incident, which saw Sukazi being denied entry into Orlando Stadium on 11 December 2021. Pirates appeared before the PSL DC on Wednesday, and their case was postponed. PSL prosecutor Majavu explained: "Charges were formally put to Orlando Pirates to which they pleaded not guilty. The matter had to be postponed to 15 February for evidence to be led. "One of the main witnesses of Orlando Pirates is currently out of the country on CAF business, and under the circumstances, the committee deemed it prudent to grant a postponement to 15 February when the matter will resume and hopefully proceed to be finalised. "Once it is finalised, I will give a further update on the outcome, therefore," Majavu concluded.
