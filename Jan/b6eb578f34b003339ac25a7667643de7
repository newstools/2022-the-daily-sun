SUPPORTERS have gathered outside the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg to await the start of Ntuthuko Shoba’s trial today, Monday 24 January. Inside the gallery, tensions were high as Tshegofatso Pule’s family brawled with Shoba’s family. Pule’s sister couldn’t hold back her tears, yelling: “This man killed my sister, yet he boldly stands in front of us showing no remorse.” To restore order, everyone was ordered to exit the gallery and the trial will now begin later than scheduled. The matter was postponed to next Monday because the state and defence had to sort out cellphone evidence matters. Shoba is the alleged mastermind behind the murder of Tshegofatso, his girlfriend. He was accused of hiring Muzikayise Malepane (31), who was sentenced last year for carrying out the murder. Shoba faces a Schedule 6 offence of premeditated murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and defeating the ends of justice. The heavily pregnant Pule was found by a passerby hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort in June 2020 with multiple stab wounds to her upper body.
