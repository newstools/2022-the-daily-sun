JOMO Cosmos owner coach Jomo Sono has resorted to mind games as part of his motivational strategy to ignite the fighting nerve in his players to retain their GladAfrica Championship status. In what seems like a business move, Sono has cautioned his players that they will starve to bed without money if Ezenkosi are relegated to the ABC Motsepe League at the end of season. Ezenkosi are bottom of the Championship table on 13 points from 17 matches – a point behind Black Leopards, two behind TS Sporting and trail 13th-placed Pretoria Callies by three points. Said Sono: “This is not a good position to be in. But we are going to survive. We’re playing so well. “At one stage we were 10 points behind Leopards, and we came from behind to close (down) the gap to one point before the festive break. “The players also don’t want to see the team relegated because they know this is their bread and butter. They are paid to feed their families, and if the team gets relegated, where are we going to get the budget to pay them in the Motsepe League?” The Orlando Pirates legend is positive they will survive as he is eyeing a striker currently on national duty in the Africa Nations Cup in Cameroon to solve their scoring problem. However, Sono refused to divulge his name before he seals the deal, as PSL clubs might snatch him. Added Sono: “We are capable, ask JDR Stars? “We could have beaten them 7-2, but we ended up losing the match 3-2 as we missed plenty of scoring chances. “We dominated majority of our games, but 80% we couldn’t score.”
