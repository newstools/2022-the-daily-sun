After 20 years on the run, the mafia gangster thought he had gotten away with murder but that wasn’t to be. Gioacchino Gammino was convicted of murder in Italy but managed to flee from prison in Rome, in 2002. Following that he became one of Italy’s most-wanted fugitives but has now been caught. The Daily Star reports that detectives spotted him on a Google Maps Street View and was found to be using the false name, Manuel. Detectives in Italy were able to learn about his new life in Spain after changing his name and opening his own shop thanks to the image on Google. According to The Mirror, Gammino was found with his head down and evading capture for nearly two decades in Galapagar, near the Spanish capital, Madrid. Detectives tracked him down outside his grocery store after spotting him on Google Maps. It is unknown if Gammino owned the restaurant, but images on the Facebook page appear to show him dressed as a chef.
