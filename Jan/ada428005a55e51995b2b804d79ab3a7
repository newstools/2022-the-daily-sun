ACTRESS Thuli Phongolo has responded to the allegations that she was fired by The Wife after she would not pitch for shooting. According to the allegations, Thuli gave the producers a hard time by not pitching up when they were shooting her scenes of her role, Lerato. It is alleged that that forced writers to write off Lerato, which was allegedly not part of the initial plan. In a statement that Thuli’s management sent to Daily Sun, she refuted the allegations labelling them as baseless. “Concerning the allegations that have been in the media relating to Thuli’s professionalism and work ethic, we vehemently would like to refute them as baseless and devoid of substance.” The statement further said that the former Generations:The Legacy star was not fired from this show which is inspired by Dudu Busani-Dube’s book titled Hlomu The Wife, but she reached a mutual agreement with the producers to end her role. “It is imperative to note that Thuli and the producers of the show reached a mutual agreement to end her role on The Wife pursuant to them agreeing that the production schedules for continued filming were unsuitable for all parties involved,” read the statement. Her management further defended her in the allegations of unprofessionalism. They said: “Thuli has always displayed the utmost level of professionalism and commitment towards her clients and craft. This is evident in her decision to continuously manage expectations of her clients even when in circumstances where difficult decisions need to be made.”
