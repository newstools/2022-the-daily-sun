FORMER finance minister Tito Mboweni has resigned as ANC MP with immediate effect on Monday, 31 January. His resignation was confirmed by Parliament spokesman Moloto Mothapo through his Twitter account. “This is to confirm that former minister of finance, Mr Tito Mboweni, has handed his resignation as MP in the National Assembly to Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. The resignation is effective from today, 31 January 2022. Speaker wishes the former minister well on his retirement,” he tweeted. The ANC is yet to confirm his resignation or his replacement to the National Assembly. Mboweni last year asked to be relieved of his duties as finance minister and was replaced by Enoch Godongwana in his portfolio. Announcing his reshuffle of Cabinet in August, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Mboweni had put in a request to be excused some time back and it was time to give in to the request. “Minister Mboweni took up this position following the sudden departure of former minister Nhlanhla Nene in October 2018. Since then, he has effectively and ably steered National Treasury through extremely difficult economic times, providing stability and instilling confidence. I am grateful to minister Mboweni for responding to the call to serve our nation at its time of need,” Ramaphosa said at the time. Mboweni, who is known for his rants on Twitter, shied away from announcing his exit from Parliament but instead posted cryptic messages and the scenery of Magoebaskloof, which is his hometown. “It has been a long journey. Sometimes very lonely,” he tweeted.
