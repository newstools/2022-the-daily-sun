MAMELODI Sundowns’ DStv Diski Challenge coach, Surprise Moriri, is fully aware that his charges are way behind, and they need to climb up the log table to catch up with leaders. Sundowns have been struggling to maintain consistency since the start of the season, which resulted in them falling behind favourites to win this season title, Orlando Pirates and Stellenbosch FC, as well as Chippa United. The 2017 Diski Challenge winners have only managed to get 23 points in 14 games. They are 10 points behind Pirates, who are leading the standings. On Sunday, Sundowns host Baroka FC at Lucas Moripe Stadium at 10am. Baroka are heading to the match with hopes of getting back to winning ways after losing 4-1 to AmaZulu last weekend, while Downs want to make it two wins in a row, having thumped Royal AM 4-2 last weekend. “The past result gives us huge confidence going into our next home match against Baroka,” said Moriri. “It is a game that we have to go out there and make sure we get our three points. “We have to work hard that we have to climb up the ladder.” With games coming thick and fast in the Diski Challenge, inconsistency is also starting to creep in. The top three teams Pirates, Stellenbosch FC and Chippa, suffered a blow last weekend when they all lost their matches. And the trio face another tricky weekend, where they could drop more points. Pirates travel to Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday (10am), where they will face AmaZulu who are slowly gaining momentum. TS Galaxy, who ended Pirates eight-match winning streak, host Chippa at Tsakane Stadium on the same day at 10am, while Stellenbosch welcome Abafana bamaMkhize at Idas Valley Sports Ground at noon.
