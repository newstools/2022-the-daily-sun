  Emalahleni Local Municipality mayor, Linah Malatjie was killed in a car crash that left his husband and the driver of the other vehicle dead in the early hours of Monday morning, 3 January. Malatjie and her husband were travelling towards the direction of Emalahleni from KwaMhlanga when the accident occurred. It is understood that the couple was from a birthday party of Mpumalanga Human Settlement MEC, Speedy Mashilo. The accident happened on R544 between Gemsbokfontein and Verena. Mpumalanga Community Safety spokesman, Moeti Mmusi said the accident was a head collision between a sport utility vehicle and a bakkie. He said the driver of the bakkie died on the scene while Malatjie and the husband succumbed to their injuries at the KwaMhlanga hospital. Tributes continue to pour in for the late Malatjie, ANC Acting secretary, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali said it is indeed a sad moment for the ANC in Mpumalanga and the whole community of Emalahleni.  She said when she received the news she had to rush to the scene with the family. "We are sending condolences to the Malatjie and Lushaba family, the entire Emalahleni community, and the ANC in Mpumalanga. It’s painful is that the kids said we are orphaned just like that. It is heartbreaking hence we are requesting that we at least give the family some time to process these matters. The family members are still gathering and we are really in shock at what we have seen. We are sending condolences to the other occupant of the other vehicle. Emalahleni has lost a really great leader," she said Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC, Vusi Shongwe said he is devastated by the news. He said Malatjie was a humble individual who served the ANC very well. Mpumalanga premier, Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, and members of the Executive Council are expected to visit the family this afternoon.
