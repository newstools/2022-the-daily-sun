A CIT robbery has  left a father dead while his wife and children are fighting for their lives in hospital. Police have launched a manhunt for suspects behind this incident. Lieutenant Robert Netshiunda said the G4S cash truck was traveling along the Van Dyk Street near Carnival City when it was allegedly rammed from behind by a Mercedes Benz sedan. He further stated that it was reported that the cash truck rolled over a private vehicle and allegedly killed a 44-year-old father and injured his wife and children. "Security guards inside the cash truck were also injured during the incident and were taken to hospital for treatment," said Netshiunda. He said no money was stolen and no firearms were taken from the security guards. "Two cartridges were found at the scene. The suspects were said to be traveling in three vehicles, an Audi, a Golf, and Mercedez Benz," he said. "The Mercedez Benz was abandoned at the scene and preliminary investigations revealed that the vehicle was reported stolen in Jeppe in December 2021," he added. Netshiunda said cases of Attempted Cash In-transit and Culpable Homicide have been opened and police investigations are continuing. "Anyone with information is urged to contact the nearest police station. Alternatively, they can tip-off the police anonymously on MySAPS App which can be downloaded on any smartphone," Netshiunda concluded.
