SOUTH Africa’s deeply-rooted gender-based violence may have contributed to Patrick Shai taking his own life. The backlash that the veteran actor and activist received on social media platforms, that many have claimed contributed to his suicide, played no part. This was according to Thami Madondo, spokesman of Khuluma Ndoda Foundation founded by Shai to help men speak about their problems. Speaking at Shai’s memorial service at the Market Theatre in Joburg on Thursday, 27 January, Madondo said: “When Bab Patrick Shai took this decision, it had nothing to do with his family. “It had nothing to do with all you see on social media. It had everything to do with himself.”  Madondo said he and Shai travelled around the country to speak to communities about gender-based violence and when they drove back, they would cry together in the car. “He could not stand and face the people who were consulting him,” he said. Patrick’s brother Solly thanked his sister-in-law, Mmasechaba, for taking care of his brother and their family. “You made him a good man and took care of him,” said Solly.  Actress Nambitha Mpumlwana said Shai didn’t seek the spotlight but it followed him. A representative from the Kwanele Foundation said: “Shai was one of the influential voices that pushed us to formalise our cause.” Shai’s funeral will be held on Saturday, 29 January at the Soweto Theatre.
