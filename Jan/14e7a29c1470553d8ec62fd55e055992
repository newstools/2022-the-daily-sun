Baroka FC have confirmed the club have parted ways with two players, though did not give reasons for the departures. The Limpopo side, who are struggling near the foot of the DStv Premiership, have released defender Elliot Seema and forward Joslin Kamatuka. “We take this opportunity to wish them well in their feature endeavours,” Baroka said in a brief statement. Seema, who has previously played for Polokwane City, Highlands Park and Swallows FC, leaves after 18 months at the club in which he made only nine league appearances and two starts. Namibian Kamatuka has also been used sparingly in his 18 months at the side with 11 league starts and only two so far this season. He was signed from Cape United at the start of the 2020-21 season. -SuperSport
