KAIZER Chiefs’ young midfield sensation Nkosingiphile Ngcobo has credit the entire team for helping him win the goal of the month gong at the DStv Premiership monthly awards. Ngcobo’s stunner against Maritzburg United was voted the best goal for the month of December in the league The 22-year-old, however, wouldn’t take all the credit for his goal and believes the entire team played an important role. “It was a good goal, but I think the entire team deserves credit,” said Ngcobo. “That goal was created by the entire team, the way we moved the ball was very good. I think Njabulo Blom did well to find me in those half spaces and I was able to turn and finish. “I was lucky to be the one who applied the finishing touch but it was a team goal.”
