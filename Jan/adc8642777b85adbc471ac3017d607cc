Police are on the hunt
for 11 suspects accused of shooting a man sleeping in his car at a petrol
station, before bombing an ATM during the early hours of Tuesday in the Free
State. According to the Free
State police, three men travelling from Gauteng to the Eastern Cape stopped at
an Engen petrol station in Bloemfontein to rest before continuing their
journey. The men, who were
sleeping in their vehicle, were woken up at around 01:10 by someone knocking on
the window. "According to
their explanation, an unknown male pointed them with a firearm and shot one of
them, a 34-year-old victim who was sitting in the car," police
spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said. "The bullet hit
him on the upper left arm." According to the
occupants, there were 11 suspects at the petrol station. As they drove away,
they continued to hear gunshots followed by a loud bang. "The employees at
the filling station also heard the loud sound from their restroom. One of the
workers at the station pressed the panic button and the security company
reacted and arrived at the scene. The suspects fled the scene on foot." Police said that while
the ATM was blown up, no money was taken. "The 34-year-old
victim who was shot at was rushed to hospital where he is receiving treatment,"
Covane said. A case of malicious
damage to property and attempted murder had been opened for further
investigation. SOURCE: NEWS24
