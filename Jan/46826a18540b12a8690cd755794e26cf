You can now buy pills that stop your farts from smelling bad. If you know that your fart smells can sometimes be unbearable, this might just be a life saver for you and your dignity. The Sun reports that a French inventor has created pills that can make your farts smell of roses or even chocolate if you like. The pills come in a variety of flavors namely ginger, violet, chocolate, and lily of the valley and the pills are also pet friendly. Christian Poincheval, a 65-year-old who hails from the village of Gesvres, says he was eating dinner with friends in 2006 when he realized the group had farted and the farts were so smelly after the copious meal, they nearly suffocated and he began his research and discovery. “You can disguise the sound of a fart but not the stench. The people at the table next to us were not happy. Something had to be done. ” he told The Telegraph. Poincheval also claims his pills not only create rose-scented farts, they reduce intestinal gas and bloating thanks to ingredients like vegetable coal, fennel, seaweed, plant resin, bilberry, and cacao zest. The tablets are made from natural ingredients and sold by French company PilulePet for around £20 for a pack of 60.
