FOUR men were arrested on Friday, 21 January in Mapleton, Boksburg for possession of suspected stolen diesel. Colonel Dimakatso Sello said the Gauteng highway patrol received a tip-off about the illegal sale of diesel stored at a certain plot in Mapleton. She said the address was closely monitored and tactically approached. “The four suspects were caught in the act of filling different containers with diesel. They could not produce proof of purchase and were all arrested for possession of suspected stolen diesel,” Sello said. She said the recovered diesel was 10 000 litres. All suspects are expected to appear in court soon. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela praised the cops for the swift reaction that ensured that suspects were arrested and the diesel recovered.
