DJ BLUNTSET is a man of many talents. The Ligwalagwala FM presenter, whose real name is Manqoba Ngwenya, has even turned his attention to helping young artists realise their musical talent. The 40-year-old hosts the radio station’s current affairs show every morning and edits children’s programmes Nal’ibali and Lalela Indzajtana. Before joining the SABC, Manqoba, who was born and raised in Mbombela in Mpumalanga, made a name for himself writing jingles. “Music is in my blood. I enjoy spinning vinyl at gigs and helping the youth realise their talent in my spare time,” he said. Manqoba said he and his two siblings were raised by a single mum, who went on to become a pastor in the Anglican Church. His talents have not gone unrecognised and in 2007, he won the Employee of the Year Award. His colleagues appreciate the hard work he puts into making sure programmes are aired without any hiccups.

Manqoba said he would describe his creative side as a hustler DJ of mellow hip-hop. He told the SunTeam he was proud to have helped a lot of up-and-coming artists and event managers, while still helping to make sure the radio station was on the air 24 hours a day. “What keeps me going is prayer and exercise but nothing beats prayer,” he said.
