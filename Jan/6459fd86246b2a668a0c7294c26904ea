Attorney Tony Mathe said: “His condition is still not the best. He was discharged from the hospital yesterday. So we haven’t had time to talk to him properly. He’s still in a lot of pain. We’re hoping we will see him and get instructions on the way forward.” Mathe said he didn’t have the details of the injuries Jabu suffered. “We know he was complaining of chest pains but obviously there might be more he will tell us. We saw him briefly and he had taken some medication, so we didn’t get much time with him,” he said. ALSO READ : PATRICK SHAI’S SON EMBARRASSED BY HIS VIDEOS!
