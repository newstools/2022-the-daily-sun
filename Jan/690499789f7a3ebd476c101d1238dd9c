PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has assured Mzansi that he will be receiving the first part of the final report of the Zondo Commission on Tuesday, 4 January. The president said the final report would be submitted to him in three parts. “The handover of the first part of the report will take place at the Union Buildings in Pretoria at 3.30pm tomorrow (today) 4 January,” he said in a statement released on Monday, 3 January. The president said the second part was expected to be handed over at the end of this month and the final part at the end of next month. The commission had until the end of last month to hand over the report but it approached the high court in Tshwane and was given an extension to 28 February. Speaking in December, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said: “Our recent assessment of the work has revealed that, while parts of the report relating to certain work streams or state-owned entities (SOEs) and topics will be ready before the end of December, there are some parts that relate to other work streams or SOEs or topics that will still need further work beyond the end of December if the commission is not to compromise the quality of the report.” Ramaphosa joined the commission’s court action and asked to be given four months after receiving the report before submitting a copy to Parliament. Judge Mandla Mbongwe ordered Ramaphosa to submit the report to Parliament by 20 June and include an indication on how the commission’s recommendations would be implemented. But the receipt of the report may be delayed should the lobby group Democracy in Action succeed in its bid stop the handover. Group chairman Thabo Mtshweni said the president had a conflict of interest as some witnesses had linked him to wrongdoing when they appeared before the commission. He said his organisation would prefer for Deputy President David Mabuza to receive the report.
