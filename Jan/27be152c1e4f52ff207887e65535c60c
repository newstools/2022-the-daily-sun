SUSPENDED Nkandla FM DJ Mfundo ‘Mabetween’ Madlala has accused the station of unfairly suspending him. Mfundo, who presented the midday show from Monday to Friday, said programmes manager Mfulongashi Mpungose suspended him after he was sabotaged by colleagues. Mfundo told Daily Sun he was hired to MC a wedding in December and took leave from 28 to 29 December. “Mfulongashi allowed me to go to the wedding and told me to ask colleagues to stand in for me on my shows. “Two colleagues agreed, so I was surprised when I received an SMS that I was suspended. I heard those two presenters didn’t pitch.” Mfundo, who had been with the KZN radio station for two years, said he suspected that the two DJs and Mfulongashi were trying to get him fired.

Mfundo said he was suspended on 28 December and whenever he tried to phone Mfulongashi, he was blown off. “Now it looks like I have been fired but they don’t want to tell me. What hurts me is that it all happened unfairly,” he said. “I have spent 15 years at different radio stations and I have not been suspended or made a mistake. I’m willing to go back to Nkandla FM but justice must prevail.” Mfulongashi said he was not allowed to talk to the media and referred the SunTeam to station manager Mgcobeni Khanyile, who said they could only confirm that Mfundo was suspended. “He is suspended and not fired. I will call him for a meeting to discuss all the issues with him. I can’t reveal internal issues to the media,” he said.
