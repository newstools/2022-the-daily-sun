BAROKA chairman Khurishi Mphahlele says it is their dream to sign former Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana. However, Mphahlele told SunSport that his club is still young and they cannot afford the veteran midfielder’s salary. “Honesty, we would love to have him in our team, but we need to be realistic, we cannot afford him,” said Mphahlele. “He (Kekana) is a good player and everyone knows it. He has achieved a lot in football and any team would love to have an experienced player like him.” The 36-year-old has been without a team since he left the DStv Premiership champions Sundowns last month. There have been reports that the Zebediela-born star is negotiating with a top flight team based in Limpopo province. However, Mphahlele has made it clear that Baroka are not talking to Kekana. “For us it is just a dream to have him in our team. But if he would love to join us we will welcome him.” Other top flight teams in Limpopo are Marumo Gallants and Sekhukhune United. Kekana spent 10 years at Downs and enjoyed much success with then coach Pitso Mosimane, who left the 10-times Premiership champions last season to join Egyptian giants Al Ahly. Kekana won many trophies with Downs including the biggest club competition in African continent, the Caf Champions League in 2016. Kekana also has 30 Bafana Bafana caps with five goals. Since Mosimane left, Kekana has struggled for game time under Downs co-coaches Steve Komphela, Rhulani Mokwena and Manqoba Mngqithi. Kekana has been playing professional football for over 15 years. He has also played for now defunct Bloemfontein Celtic, Black Leopards and SuperSport United. It remains to be seen which club he will sign for next month as he has made it clear that he still wants to continue playing.
