CHANGE is coming to the land of Skeem Saam as five new pupils step up to face life – and the cameras. The popular SABC1 TV show has announced it will be introducing a new generation of pupils from Turfloop High School in Limpopo. Skeem Saam was introduced to TV viewers over a decade ago and in that time it has turned into one of the biggest TV shows in Mzansi, at one stage clocking up a breathtaking viewership of six million. South Africans fell in love with the young men and women who were trying to navigate school, friendships, love and family. The older cast members are grown and have pursued various careers on the show. Mahlatse (Phillip Thobejane) and Letetswe (Mahlatse Moropo), who have already graced the screens, will be joined by Lewatle (Mosa Nkwashu), Mosebjadi (Zizo Sobhutyu) and Paxton Kgomo (Thabiso Molokomme).

Skeem Saam’s publicist Sumaya Mogola told Daily Sun the show’s been known to continuously introduce fresh faces. “The new pupils are a great and energetic bunch. I think they will soon be winning the hearts of our viewers. Skeem Saam is an educational show and we take our obligation seriously to showcase positive behaviour or change. A student attending a school proudly is already a positive story to tell.” She said it was part of their DNA to showcase the lives of teens, their challenges and how they navigate it all. “Amid all those challenges they still have to study and do well at school.”
