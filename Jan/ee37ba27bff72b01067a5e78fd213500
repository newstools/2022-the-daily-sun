BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga has warned matric pupils there’s no time for dancing to amapiano. She told matrics at Kwamhlanga High School they must work hard and see amapiano later. Motshekga was on a school tour around Kwamhlanga. She visited three schools, Tjhidelani Primary, Kwamhlanga High School and Siboniwe Primary. “Hard work pays off and no muthi magic will make you pass. You can never regret success and matric opens doors for your bright future. “The examination you are going to write was set long before the pandemic started. Your matric qualifications have the same value as those who wrote it before the pandemic. For you, amapiano is a no and is good for those in the lower grades.” The minister said pupils won’t be forced to take the jab and parents should not be scared to send their kids to school. “Parents should not listen to rumours that kids should jab first before going to school. It is not forced to anyone, either old or young. Education comes first and every child has the right to education.” Motshekga said the aim of her visit was to check whether the plans they agreed on for this academic year were being implemented. Accompanied by Nkangala District director of education Douglas Maja, the minister said she was happy school bullying and teen pregnancy was being dealt with by school authorities, the community and cops.
