BANYANA Banyana midfielder Linda Motlhalo has signed a new contract with Swedish club, Djurgardens IF. She joined Djurgardens in January 2020 on a two-year contract and this new deal will see her stay at the club until 2023. Motlhalo shared the good news on Twitter just after the club confirmed her contract extension. In an interview with the club’s website, Motlhalo said she’s delighted to stay at Djurgardens for two more seasons, and she looks forward to creating more memories. She said she signed a new contract because she has developed a lot as a player with the club. She added that she enjoys the environment and the players even though Sweden is a lot colder compared to South Africa. “It is really cold here, but you need to adjust as a player and I enjoy playing here so the only thing to do is adjust and carry on,” she was quoted by the website. She said it was hard to fit in the team in the first few months of her time with the club because she was new. “I didn’t know the style of play but as time went on I was able to learn from the players and the coaches, asking questions and it was easy for me. Now I enjoy staying here,” she said.
