BAFANA Bafana forward Bongokuhle Hlongwane has described watching the Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon (Afcon) on television as a "painful experience''. Bafana failed to qualify for the continental showpiece. It was a painful experience for everyone after Bafana impressed in the previous Afcon finals in Egypt, knocking out the hosts in the round of 16 before losing to Nigeria’s Super Eagles in the quarterfinals. With small countries which qualified for this year’s Afcon such as Mauritania, Comoros and Gambia, fans on their social media have expressed their displeasure about Bafana’s failure and this has also left Hlongwane hurt. “It is painful but these are the things we can’t change in life,” said Hlongwane. Hlongwane believes if the SA Football Association had appointed coach Hugo Broos earlier they would have qualified for the Afcon finals. Broos replaced Molefi Ntseki in May, after the latter was sacked last March following the country’s failure to qualify. The former Cameroon coach almost guided Bafana to the World Cup play-offs but they lost against Ghana in controversial fashion when the Black Stars were awarded a dubious penalty in the final qualifier last November. Hlongwane was one of the beneficiaries from the 2017 Afcon winning coach who has opted for a youth policy. Hlongwane has taken his chances and blossomed under Broos and this helped him get signed by MSL side Minnesota United. He made his Bafana debut in a friendly against Uganda and scored in that 3-2 win. The 21-year-old striker also scored in Bafana’s 1-0 win over Ghana in the second match in the World Cup group stage matches in September. “There are things you can’t change in life,” said Hlongwane, who has scored two goals in eight appearances for Bafana. “Maybe if he (Broos) came earlier things would have been different looking at how close we came to qualify for the World Cup play-offs.”
