UNHOLY thugs have disrespected the House of God four times since 2018 – and now they’ve done it again! Andile Zwayi (41), the church steward at the Methodist Church in Southern Africa in Du Noon Cape Town, told Daily Sun that on Sunday (2/1) church members were shocked when they arrived at church. The floor was under water, electricity cables were damaged and the PA system was ruined as the thugs took away some speakers. Congregants cleaned the church and they proceeded with the Sunday service. But the thugs were not finished yet! They came back the very next day and cleaned out what they had left behind. They took plates and toilet basins. They also tried to remove the male urinals. “We have had enough of being tormented by these thugs. This is the fifth time they have done this to us since 2018,” said Zwayi. “We were forced to fork out R12 000 to upgrade some security on the church and the person who is going to put up burglar bars for the windows used by the thugs wants R4 500.”  Andile said they have to dig into their own pockets to have the church rebuild. “The thugs have no respect for the altar. They once stole all the equipment that the church uses to consume holy communion.” He said whenever they upgraded the security, thugs would find a way around it. “The broke the door at one point and we removed the door and put in a brick wall. “The thugs then removed the asbestos and gained entrance through the roof to steal.” Police spokesman Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident: “A case of burglary at the church was opened at Milnerton Police Station. It’s alleged that unknown suspects broke the window of a church in Du Noon to gain entry and stole some items.” He said no arrest has been made and investigations were continuing.
