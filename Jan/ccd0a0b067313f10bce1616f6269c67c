DAVID Ndlovu (39) sells firewood so he can put food on the table for his family. The father of four from Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, who is originally from Mozambique, said he started the business in 2016. “Life was difficult because I couldn’t find a job. I then started a business of cutting firewood using a second-hand chainsaw,” he said. “The business grew very quickly and I saved up enough money to buy myself a Toyota bakkie. I use it to transport the loads of firewood that I get from farms in Graskop who charge me for the permits and deliver to customers in the villages and towns around Bushbuckridge, Dwarsloop and other villages.” He said his family was no longer going to bed on empty stomachs. “No more tears. I’ve employed two men who are responsible fathers as well. I charge R500 per bakkieload and R6 000 for a half a truckload,” he said. David said he gets orders from hawkers, especially those selling chickens, as well as for parties, funerals and ordinary homes. “I can make up to R15 000 a month,” he said. His wife Grade Madalane said: “We’re grateful for this wonderful business. I help him take orders as he’s busy on the farm and delivering the wood.” She said her kids could eat, get clothes and attend school. “We are very happy. ”
