I’m still trying to figure out what really happened to my original copy. But I immediately felt guided by this iconic gentleman. I saw clearer. The best read from a seasoned artist, a father, an activist, the first black actor to win an Oscar, a man of many firsts. What a life! Thank you #ripsidneypoitier,” he wrote. Actress Bubu said she had an encounter with the actor and will tell the story one day. “One day (hopefully through my current project), I can tell the story of an encounter I had with Sir Sidney Poitier when I first moved to LA in 2015. Hilarious & ballsy move on my part. May you rest in Heavenly Peace, Ntate Poitier,” she wrote. Thokozani wrote: “Another screen legend has rested. He has so many ‘firsts’ in his bio, so many accolades. He made history on so many occasions in his career and his name will remain etched in the history books of cinema for time immemorial #RIPSidneyPoitier.”  A post shared by Bubu Mazibuko (@bubumazibuko)  A post shared by Thapelo Mokoena (@mokoenalive)
