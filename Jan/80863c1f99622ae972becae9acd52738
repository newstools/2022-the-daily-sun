A crocodile was seen near the spot where kids cross the river to go to school but so far, it hasn’t been caught. Not even a live chicken in a trap has worked to capture the creature! Residents of Mabuyeni near Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga, are living in fear. They are scared to take a short cut and cross the river to the neighbouring village. Ward Councillor Mncedisi Dlowu said the crocodile was spotted on 26 December by a motorist. Since then it has been seen a few times by residents crossing the river. He warned residents to be careful. “A video of the crocodile was sent to me by the motorist,” said Dlowu. “I immediately called the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency and alerted them. They sent officials who put a cage at the river bank and put a live chicken inside. We’re still waiting for the results since nothing has happened.” He said officials found tracks and confirmed it was indeed a crocodile. “On Monday a boy walking near the river saw it too. A few residents have confirmed they have seen it,” he said. Resident Moses Mthombeni (49) told Daily Sun their biggest fear was that kids walked across the river when going to school. “Everyone is in danger. We wish the animal will be caught soon before something bad happens.” Sihle Ngoma (32) said the crocodile also threatened their livestock. Kholofelo Nkambule of the tourism and parks agency said their officials would continue to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of the community. “We are hopeful that the trap set will assist us,” she said. “Should community members spot the crocodile they should alert the MTPA immediately.”
