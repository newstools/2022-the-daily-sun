MEMBERS of the Gauteng Emergency Medical Services (EMS) partook in a 3km walk in the Ekurhuleni District on Friday, 21 January, to raise awareness on the ongoing attacks on paramedics in the province. According to Health MEC spokeswoman Kwara Kekana, the march came after an incident in Reiger Park, Boksburg, on Tuesday. Paramedics were attacked at gunpoint while responding to a call where a woman was actively in labour. “They were robbed by three armed men who made off with their cellphones and wallets. The criminals also took the ambulance keys,” Kekana said in a statement. She added that a second incident took place on Wednesday, 19 January, when a crew member was attacked at gunpoint while attending to a medical call in Eersterus, Tshwane.

Fortunately, they escaped unharmed and still managed to transport the patient to hospital,” Kekana said. Both incidents were reported to the police for investigation. Health MEC Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi commended the medics, saying despite the trauma, they still assisted in the delivery of the baby and made arrangements for a second ambulance to help transport both mother and child to hospital. “Attacks on paramedics and EMS resources are simply unacceptable. We appeal to community members to work with us to protect EMS personnel,” Mokgethi said.
