PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has been called a liar to his face. This was while he was meeting with traditional leaders in Sekhukhune, Limpopo, on Wednesday, 5 January as part of the lead-up to the ANC’s birthday party in Polokwane on Saturday. Kgoshi Kagoshi Phaahla called out Ramaphosa for failing to address concerns chiefs had raised with him. Phaahla said Ramaphosa promised to transfer ownership of available land to them but many years later, nothing had happened. He said Ramaphosa made the promise in May 2017 when he was still deputy president. He said he promised it would be transferred in six months. “Today, I am standing here without a single property being transferred. “I’m still asking myself how many more lies we’re going to hear today.” Phaahla also reminded the president of a promise he made that the ANC would use its majority to change the laws governing traditional leaders. However, Ramaphosa hit back at Phaahla, saying traditional leaders should not put their interests above those of the community. “We should not come across as if we are putting our own interests first. What I would have wanted to hear about today is the interests of our people here,” Ramaphosa shot back. Meanwhile in Polokwane, deputy president David Mabuza said the ANC should not allow the Zondo Commission report to divide the organisation. Speaking to journalists after meeting with traditional leaders in the municipal chambers, Mabuza said the organisation should survive the storm. “We have gone through many challenges in this movement and this is not the first,” he said. Responding to whether the party could split, Mabuza said it would never happen. Mabuza also made it clear he would not be contesting Ramaphosa’s position at the ANC elective conference in December.
