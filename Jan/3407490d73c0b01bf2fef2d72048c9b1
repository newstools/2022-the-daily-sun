CLEMENT Doncabe is not called Mr Nice Guy for nothing. The KZN taxi driver is committed to fighting for public transport workers and commuters’ rights. The 53-year-old is the secretary of the Qina National Public Transport Workers Association and drives on the route between Clermont, Pinetown and Durban. Clement has been fighting to ensure that taxi drivers and queue marshals are recognised by employers and government. His organisation advises transport workers, hosts workshops on public relations and advanced driving, and provides information on UIF and the importance of insisting on payslips. Clement said the organisation, started in 2012, has over 700 members and was formed after he saw taxi drivers and queue marshals being taken for granted. “We work long hours with no pay and no bonuses or leave, but are an important force in the economy.” Clement has been a taxi driver for 15 years. “Before that I was a machine operator. After I lost my job, I realised the only way to survive was to become a taxi driver. I love the job and sometimes sleep at the taxi rank. It’s not about money, but my passion for making sure commuters reach their destination safely.” Clement said his organisation has partnered with the Community Constituency Front, where he was a co-ordinator. “We’ve been encouraging people to vaccinate so we can save lives and protect each other. We work with the health department to bring vaccination sites to taxi ranks.” Clement said a programme close to his heart was Vaccination4men, which pushes men to get jabbed. “Men are hesitant to seek medical help. They will take time to go to the clinic or hospital.”
