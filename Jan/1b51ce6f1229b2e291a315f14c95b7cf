CHIPPA United caretaker coach Kurt Lentjies is more than content with the progress he has made since accepting one of the most difficult jobs in Mzansi football. Lentjies hung up his boots a few months ago to take over the reins as the Chill Boys mentor in the interim following the sacking of head coach Gavin Hunt. The 36-year-old former Mamelodi Sundowns and Maritzburg United midfielder found the Gqeberha-based outfit deep in trouble, flirting with relegation. But he has since managed to pull the team away from the danger zone, currently sitting in 12th place with 16 points from their 17 matches so far this season. Lentjies reckons he’s done better than he was anticipating when he took the job and is hoping that he continues to steer the team further up the table when the season resumes next month. “I would say we are actually ahead of where we wanted to be,” Lentjies said. “We set our short and long term goals when we started the journey. “We are on the right track, the confidence is there which is what we wanted to instil. We have points to show for that as well.” Lentjies has managed to get the best out of a team that struggled for most of the first half of the campaign under the guidance of embattled former coach Hunt. And he believes there’s still more he can draw out of the current group of players, adding that he wouldn’t be concerned if they weren’t too busy in the transfer market. “I’m happy with the group of players that we have but there’s always room to improve in terms of maybe getting better players in certain positions,” added Lentjies. “However, that’s not my main focus, I’m happy to work with the current group even if no one comes through the door during this windows. “I’m happy and committed to this group. I love working with them and they love working with me. So, whether someone comes through the door or not, it doesn’t matter.”
