MOHAMED Salah, in prolific form for Liverpool this season, will lead Egypt against bogey team Nigeria in a blockbuster Group D opener at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Salah leads all scorers in the Premier League this season with 16 goals, including one in the 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Sunday, his last match before leaving for west Africa. Although Egypt have won a record seven Cup of Nations titles, they have triumphed only twice in seven clashes with three-time champions Nigeria in the competition ahead of the January 11 showdown. The group winners and runners-up are assured of last-16 places, while the best four third-placed teams from the six groups also qualify. The Pharaohs’ coach, Carlos Queiroz, has backed Aston Villa forward Mahmoud ‘Trezeguet’ Hassan (27) to shine in the Afcon, although he has not played a full senior match since mid-April due to injury. “Trezeguet is an experienced and good player. I’m sure he will be a key figure for us.,” former Real Madrid manager and twice Manchester United assistant manager Queiroz said. XAFP
