SPRINGS police in Ekurhuleni are looking for thugs who have been terrorising the Slovo community for a while. They break into houses at night and when they don’t get what they want, they shoot the victims. The suspects are usually two or three. On Saturday, 8 January a victim sat in a shack with three friends drinking alcohol when two suspects pounced on them. One suspect was armed with a firearm, while the other suspect had a knife. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the thugs robbed the victims of their cellphones and R400. “He called the brother of the victim by his name telling them to give them the money. “The one armed with a knife stabbed the brother in the chest and the brother then gave him R400 and a Samsung cellphone,” said Ramphora. The suspect then proceeded to the victim’s friend and demanded money, but found nothing. Ramphora said the suspect stabbed him on the upper right arm. “We are told they went to other shacks in the same yard to rob other tenants,” he said. Ramphora said the suspects are unknown and the shot victim was rushed to Far East Hospital. Anyone with information is asked to contact 08600 10111.
