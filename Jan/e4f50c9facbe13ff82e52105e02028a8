AN alleged 36-year-old serial killer is appearing in the
Seshego Magistrates Court for allegedly killing seven women. He faces charges of seven counts of kidnapping and seven
counts of murder. The man was initially arrested on 03 November 2021 for
possession of a suspected stolen cell phone that belonged to a woman who was
allegedly kidnapped in Lebowakgomo in October 2021. He appeared in Seshego on 05 November 2021 on a charge of
robbery and kidnapping. The accused was still in custody when the investigations led
to the discovery of seven bodies of women dumped at different locations in
Seshego, Polokwane, Mankweng, and Westenburg. It is alleged that he would lure women and promise them
employment in 2021. Two victims were positively identified by their next of kin,
however, forensic investigations are underway to determine if the bodies
positively match those of the deceased.
