The vigilance of the Western Cape Provincial Extortion Task Team's K9 Unit led to the recovery of a hijacked delivery truck in Philippi East. Western Cape police spokesperson Captain Frederick van Wyk said, at about 17:35 on Friday, officers followed up on information received regarding the whereabouts of a hijacked motor vehicle. SAPS said only battery of the vehicle was missing." The information led them to the Marikana informal settlement in Philippi East, but due to challenging road conditions, the members pursued the information on foot and recovered the truck abandoned in between the shacks," said Van Wyk. He said the truck was still intact, with just the battery missing. No arrests have been made. "The vehicle, a white KIA 2.7D Truck, will be taken to the Bellville Vehicle Safeguarding Unit, where it will be processed. The investigation continues," said Van Wyk.
