TWO men visited Pastor Mzwakhe Mfene on Sunday, 16 January and asked him to cleanse their car. However, this cost the 46-year-old his life when he was swept away by a strong current while performing rituals in the Blesbokspruit River in Nigel, Ekurhuleni. A 43-year-old man, who has not been identified yet, jumped into the river to save Mzwakhe but he also drowned. His body was found 2km away from where he drowned but police divers were unable to find the pastor’s body. On Tuesday, 18 January, the rescue team continued the search. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said: “Police divers were called to the scene. The body of the other man was recovered about 2km away and he was declared dead on the scene. “We wish to warn the community around Nigel to avoid going to streams, especially during this rainy season because the currents are strong and it’s not safe.” The pastor’s wife, Sibongile Monamodi, (44) said she was praying that her husband’s body would be found so he could have a proper burial. “It’s been a nightmare since he disappeared. I don’t sleep at night and a picture of him keeps coming to my mind. “I wish he never went there,” she said. Masondo said the other victim was the owner of the car and he was believed to be from Soweto. An inquest docket and a missing person’s case were opened at Nigel Police Station.
