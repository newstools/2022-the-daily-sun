REALITY TV star Nonku Williams has hit back at haters. This after viewers of the reality TV show Real Housewives of Durban expressed that they wanted her and her mother off the show. But the mother of three took to Instagram and said that it was time she spoke up against the constant bullying that she had been receiving on social media ever since she joined the show. “For a long time, I have kept quiet and not responded to some of the most insinuating comments on social media but it’s time I speak up,” she said. “I have a voice and as long as I have breath in my body I will never stop speaking and saying enough is enough. Enough of cyberbullying, and people thinking they are entitled to someone’s life they know nothing about. “The 20% of my life that people see on screens think entitles them to make judgments and conclusions about my life is beyond me and their level of reasoning. I can only conclude this by saying it’s a reflection of who they are and how they perceive themselves.

If Jesus, The King of Glory, was ridiculed and spat on who am I.” However, not everyone was against Nonku being on the show and she also thanked everyone who had been showing her love and support amid the backlash she had been getting. “For those that love, understand and support me, I thank you and am grateful to you,” she said. The backlash came after Nonku talked about how she wanted her child Nothile to have a relationship with Ayanda and Sfiso Ncwane’s children, but this never happened.
