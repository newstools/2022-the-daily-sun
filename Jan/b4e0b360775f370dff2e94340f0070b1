RESIDENTS of Siyahlala squatter camp are living in fear after their shacks were petrol bombed twice in one night. The first attack on residents of the settlement in Philippi, Cape Town, was unsuccessful, so the thugs came back and destroyed eight shacks on Thursday, 13 January. Phumla Mhlambisi (40) said she believed the target was her 30-year-old sister, who left Cape Town four days earlier. “When my sister was around, people were throwing stones onto her shack. At one point, she had a fist fight with one of them after catching them red-handed.” Phumla said her sister had been fighting with a local couple for playing music all night while she was trying to study for exams. She said the first petrol bomb was thrown at around 10pm and the second at 2am. “We had just fallen asleep when the second bomb was thrown. A relative who was sleeping in my sister’s room came screaming for me to leave the house. I was not dressed and left naked. I was given clothes by neighbours,” she said. Ntombozuko Stsheke (40) said she couldn’t find the keys for her burglar door and was trapped inside. “I was screaming as I thought I was going to die. Residents had to break down the door to let me out,” she said. Ntombozuko said she had bought school uniform and stationery for her kids the previous day and had now lost everything. Fire and Rescue spokesman Jermaine Carelse confirmed the incident. He said the police investigated a case of arson and arrested a woman (30) and a man (34).
