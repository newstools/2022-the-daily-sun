LEGENDARY mbaqanga band Soul Brothers has been making Mzansi dance for 46 years. But now, co-founder Black Moses Ngwenya is worried there might not be a new generation to take over. For this reason, Soul Brothers will be celebrating the group’s 46th birthday by teaching youngsters how to play in the band’s unique keyboard style. The group will also be touring the country to thank fans for their support. Speaking to Daily Sun, Black Moses said: “I will go around the country hosting workshops on how to play the keyboard. I will take those who are interested in playing to my home to teach them as well.” Black Moses said they will start with the tour and then announce the workshop dates later. “For now, we have finalised tour dates for Mpumalanga, KZN and Gauteng.

We were the first band to start mbaqanga, and our fans have supported us all the way for 46 years. We owe them a big thanks. “We will perform our old and new songs. We will also get the opportunity to perform songs from our new album Iqiniso, which was released in 2021.” Black Moses said the lead vocalist on the new album is Sibusiso Mbatha, a member of another mbaqanga band called Abangani. Black Moses said during the tour, Thokozani Hadebe will be the lead vocalist, because the group is still looking for a replacement for David Masondo, who died in 2015. “We’re still searching for the band’s vocal leader, but both Thokozani and Sibusiso stand a chance,” he told the People’s Paper.
