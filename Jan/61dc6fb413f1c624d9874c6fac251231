THE National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has formed a new “task force” as a response to the recommendations made in the Zondo Commission report. In a statement released on Wednesday, 12 January, the NPA said it was reviewing the commission’s findings and recommendations, with a view to deal with those who had broken the law. “An urgent review of all cases covered in the report, including those already proclaimed by the NPA’s Investigating Directorate (ID) will be conducted. “The task force’s main focus is on progress and impact. “It builds on the work already done within the NPA over the past few years, in collaboration with the Zondo Commission and other law enforcement partners,” the statement said. The statement comes a week after Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo criticised the NPA for its failure to take on state capture. He suggested the government establish an independent crime-busting body and call the Public Procurement Anti-Corruption Agency. The NPA said its strategy would include, “the freezing and forfeiture of the proceeds of crimes”. They said they will ask for help from the National Treasury, DPSA and the Solicitor General’s Office, and the Minister and the director-general of justice department. “South Africans deserve to see justice being done for heinous crimes that have undermined our country’s development prospects, that have disproportionately affected the poor and the vulnerable, and ruined the lives and dreams of many people,” it said, adding that the task ahead wasn’t easy but it was committed to dealing with it. “The NPA and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) are committed to ending impunity for high-level corruption and other crimes in South Africa,” the statement concluded.
