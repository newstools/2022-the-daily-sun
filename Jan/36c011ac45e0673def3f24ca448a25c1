FOLLOWING two unfortunate cancellations due to the Covid-19 outbreak pandemic, the biggest running race in Africa is coming back bigger and better. The 51st Two Oceans Marathon will take place on the Easter weekend of 16 and 17 April. Registration for the half-marathon and ultra marathon distances will open in a fortnight. “Our wish is to have the event over two days,” said race director Debra Barnes. “We wish to host the numbers (of athletes) like in the past (in both 21,1km and 56km distances). “But we will comply with the (recommended) limits and date plans approved by our key stakeholders.” For now they wait for a green light from the City of Cape Town before proceeding with their plans. Athletics SA (ASA) president, James Moloi said he would engage Sports Minister, Nathi Mthethwa, to increase the numbers to 10 000 runners this year. If the request is approved, TOM will have at least 10 000 runners lining up the streets of Cape Town. Added Barnes: “Due to the extra layer of logistics necessitated by our proposed change to a two-day event, and our willing compliance with the Disaster Management Act, we have had more focus on internal teams at both board and office team levels dedicated to operational planning.” “The planning is not without challenges, but we remain agile, innovative, and solution-oriented,” she said.
