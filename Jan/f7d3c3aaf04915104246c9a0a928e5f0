FOR four years, DJ Man of the Match has been longing to meet Eskom’s top management. The 54-year-old, whose real name is Sonnyboy Ngubeni, told Daily Sun he wanted to present his 2018 album to the power utility. The DJ from Phola Park, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, said he was raising awareness of issues concerning electricity with the album, titled Eskom Khanyisa. “I decided to compile the album after my eight-month-old baby was burnt by boiling water in 2016. My baby spent two weeks in hospital. I want to give the CD to Eskom so they can use it to teach the community about the dangers of electricity. “I’ve been trying hard to gain access to Eskom’s main offices, but security guards told me they can’t make an appointment for me.” Sonnyboy said tracks such as Izinyoka Nyoka warned people not to make illegal connections.

Trying to get free electricity has had a negative impact on the company and those who buy electricity,” he said. Sonnyboy said his song, Mhinga Timi Gezi, was a plea to Eskom not to switch off the lights. He said people relied on the power utility for the economy to grow. “Every household needs Eskom to survive, so the album tells the utility that people need it and also tells people what the company needs from them,” he said. “When people listen to it, they will know exactly what is needed from them.” Sonnyboy said that he started making music in 1996 while he was living in Joburg. He said he used to drive taxis and later became a queue marshal, but he left the industry due to violence. He now works as a dressmaker.
