RESIDENTS of Mthatha, Eastern Cape, are accusing cops from Madeira Police Station of working with a syndicate that charges them money to certify their documents. One of the residents visited the police station and when she got there, she was told to go into a temporary structure next to the police station to certify her documents. “But before I could go inside, I met three guys who offered to make things easy for me by taking my documents inside while I waited for them outside,” said the resident. They apparently told her if she didn’t pay them R10 for each document, she would wait in the queue for hours. “At first I thought they were joking, but then I saw the long queue,” she said. “I asked people in the queue why the queue was slow and they said they were being punished because they refused to pay.” She decided to pay because she was rushing somewhere. The SunTeam visited the police station and was asked to pay the money by the three members of the syndicate who stood just outside the temporary structure used as additional offices for the cops. Residents said they couldn’t be paying for free government services. Sergeant Kaya Matola-Mvanyashe said police were not aware of the allegations. “An affidavit is a sworn statement which could be written by any police officer and that service is available free of charge at all police stations,” said Mvenyashe. She said police were viewing this in a serious light and urged anyone with information to lodge a formal complaint or open a criminal case of fraud for further investigation.
