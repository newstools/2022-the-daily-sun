MAMELODI Sundowns’ dominance in the DStv Premiership monthly awards continues with coaches Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena as well as midfielder Andile Jali all receiving individual prizes. Mngqithi and Mokwena walked away with the coach of the month award for December, their third consecutive award having won the last two as well. The co-coaches of the defending league champions have been rewarded after an impressive run last month when they led Sundowns to four victories and two draws in the seven matches. They suffered their first loss of the season away to AmaZulu. Royal AM, SuperSport United, Baroka FC were all beaten and the highlight of the Brazilians’ good run in December came when they thumped title rivals Orlando Pirates at home. In their seven games they conceded 7 goals, hitting the back of the net 12 times, to end the month and year 14-points clear of second placed Pirates. “Thanks for the award but it belongs to the entire team,” said Mngqithi. “I must congratulate the boys, the coaching staff, and the entire support staff for making it possible for the team to continue achieving it’s target. We didn’t have the best performances, we even dropped five points but thanks to everyone for helping us get here.” Mokwena echoed the sentiments of his fellow co-coach, adding that the players deserve most of the praise for the club’s success. “We receive this award on behalf of everyone who has contributed to the success of the team,” said Mokwena. “These individual awards are a reflection of the success of the entire team. We have to congratulate everyone at the club, especially the players because the game belongs to them.”
