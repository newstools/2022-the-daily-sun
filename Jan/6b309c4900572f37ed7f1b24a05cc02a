THE murder of a matric pupil on New Year’s Day is being investigated. Wisdom Anyanwu (17) was stabbed to death in Langa, Cape Town, by a man who had asked for a lighter. His mum Thobeka (43) said Wisdom had recently completed his matric exams at Bonteheuwel High School. “My son had gone out to wish another family member a happy new year when he met his death,” she said. Thobeka said Wisdom’s friends told her a man asked him for a lighter and got offended when Wisdom tried to light his cigarette for him instead of handing the lighter over. “His friends didn’t see him being stabbed. He came and told them he had been stabbed in the chest and that was the wound that took his life,” she said. Thobeka said she was looking forward to Wisdom’s matric results. “I was waiting for good results because he was very smart. “We were preparing for university, not his funeral. I am hurt that he was killed over a lighter,” she said. “I don’t know how we will bury him. I am asking anyone who might be able to assist me to bury him to come forward because I have nothing.” Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said the incident was being investigated. He said the victim was declared dead at a medical facility. Anyone with information about the incident can contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
