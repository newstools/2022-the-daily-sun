GOGO is living a terrible life, as kak flows all over her yard. Not only is eating her food a nightmare, but she even battles to breathe. She can’t even plant flowers, vegetables or fruit and the flies have taken over her house. Gogo Mitah Seakgoe (68) from Temba unit 2 in Hammans-kraal, Tshwane told Daily Sun the sewage has been a problem for almost four years, but now it has become worse. She said she has tried many times to report the mess, but no one from the municipality has bothered to come and fix their problem. “This stinking water is affecting my health,” she said.

Mitah’s son George Seakgoe (44) said: “We stay indoors, no matter how hot it gets because of the smell. We are not coping,” he said. George suffers from TB and the sewage has made it worse. Neighbour Sophy Skhosana said: “We always struggle with our toilets because they get blocked. City of Tshwane is failing to fix the problem permanently. We are tired of asking to use the toilets of neighbours.” Ward 74 councillor Zachiariah Setimo said: “This is a health hazard. “We can’t allow these residents to live under such terrible conditions. We need to get them help so their problem is fixed.” City spokesman Lindela Mashego said: “If there is a sewage leak, residents are encouraged to inform customer care so a reference number can be issued and the process appropriately tracked.”
