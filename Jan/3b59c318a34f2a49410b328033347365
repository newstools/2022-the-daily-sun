SUNPOWER can help everybody. It can even help a guy with a small 4-5 to find real love! A man who’s been miserable because of his small 4-5 is about to find happiness. Daily Sun published the story of the 36-year-old in November last year and now he’s found a woman who’s willing to settle with him, regardless of any of his small problems. A 37-year-old woman from Eden Park, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun she was tired of being hurt by men who leave her and this man’s 4-5 didn’t bother her. The man said he’s given up trying to enlarge his 4-5 and has already spent R5 000 on izangoma and pills. The woman on the other hand said she’s had too much bad luck. “Poking doesn’t even matter to me anymore. I’ve been hurt by men with big and medium-sized 4-5s, so I’m tired of them,” she said. She told Daily Sun the last man she dated had a big 4-5 and he ended up cheating on her with her cousin. “I almost threw in the towel when it comes to men, but I can’t let someone ruin my love life. I want to continue giving love to whoever deserves it and I think this man deserves it,” she said. She has an eight-year-old son and she said she even wanted to give this man babies. “My best friend thinks I’m crazy for doing this, but I know what I want. I’m not crazy for thinking this man is my soulmate,” she said. The man with the small 4-5 is very happy to meet this woman. “A woman has never asked me out before. I hope that it’ll be a great relationship,” he said. “At first I thought it was a joke until we actually spoke on the phone. “We’ve already set up a date and I can’t wait to meet her.” The man said that he was hoping she won’t make a joke out of his situation when they got into an argument. “I’ve had some ladies who’ve made fun of me and it really hurts when someone makes fun of me,” he said.
