ATHLETICS South Africa will this weekend host elite athletes and their coaches to outline the 2022 athletics season with the two stakeholders. The session will start tomorrow (10am) at the Garden Court OR Tambo Hotel in Kempton Park, where the focus will be on the ASA Fixture List, which includes domestic and international competitions. They will then go through the Team Selection Criteria and also discuss participation at the CAA African Championships in Mauritius, scheduled for 8-12 June. Also in the agenda will be the final preparation for the World Athletics Championships, set for 15-24 July and Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2-8 August. “This is our family meeting where the national federation will touch base with the athletes and coaches to compare notes, share information and remind each other of the professionalism that goes with it,” said James Moloi, the president of ASA. “We are therefore looking forward to this session with these key stakeholders in the life of athletics in South Africa and throughout the world,” South Africa’s performance during last year’s Olympic Games was appalling, resulting in three medals won, but athletics was the worst hit with zero medal count. This session, which is an annual event, will also address such matters of concern.
