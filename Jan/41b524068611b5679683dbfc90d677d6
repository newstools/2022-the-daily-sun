GUINEA held tournament favourites Senegal to a 0-0 draw in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group B match at the Kouekong Stadium in Cameroon on Friday afternoon. The draw saw Guinea and Senegal remain at the top and second respectively on the group standings - level on points heading into their final group matches which will be played on Tuesday. The National Elephants started the match brightly with their captain and star midfielder Naby Keita having stamped his authority in the middle of the park. The Guineans should have broken the deadlock in the 31st minute following a great move that was started by Keita as he carried the ball into the Lions of Teranga's half. Keita then step up Ilaix Moriba, who played a defence-splitting pass for Josuha Guilavogui, but somehow the VLF Wolfsburg star unleashed a tame shot which was saved by goalkeeper Seny Dieng. This proved to be the only clear cut chance of the game in the first-half which saw Guinea neutralize Senegal's star attackers Sadio Mane and Boulaye Dia, and the score was 0-0 at halftime. Senegal came back an improved side following their halftime team talk with coach Aliou Cisse and they finally registered their maiden attempt on target in the game four minutes before the hour-mark. Abdou Diallo connected with a cross from the left, but the Paris Saint Germain (PSG) defender's headed effort was fantastically saved by keeper Aly Keita. Aly Keita was in good form in the National Elephants' goal-posts as he made a fine save to deny Mamadou Loum with the Lions of Teranga pushing for the opening goal. Kaba Diawara - the Guinea coach - introduced Mory Konate with 12 minutes left on the clock as the National Elephants looked to regain control of the game and snatch a late winning goal. However, neither side was able to create the clear-cut chances required to win the match and the encounter ended in a 0-0 draw.-supersport.com
