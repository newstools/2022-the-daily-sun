PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has overcome the first hurdle to a second term. Limpopo has become the first province to endorse him ahead of the ANC elective conference in December. As a province where the radical economic transformation faction dominates, winning four of the five regions at recent conferences has given his campaign a massive boost. It’s said that Ramaphosa’s victory was engineered by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, who is believed to be close friends with provincial treasurer Danny Msiza, who is facing criminal charges linked to the VBS scandal. At the party’s 110th birthday celebration held at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Saturday, provincial chairman and Premier Stan Mathabatha announced the news. When asked whether he would seek a second term, Ramaphosa said he would leave it to the branches. However, it has been reported that some Mpumalanga regions would back him and negotiations were underway in KZN. ALSO READ | PAKISTANI TRADER LEFT

He said factional battles were deflecting from their focus on service delivery. He said people were not happy with the direction the party was going in, which was reflected in the recent local government elections where the ANC received less than 50% of the vote nationally.
