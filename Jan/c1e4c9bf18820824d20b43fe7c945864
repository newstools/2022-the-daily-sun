Miss International South Africa Dr Ferini Dayal has brought her two favourite things – pageantry and medicine – together to fulfil her purpose. The 27-year-old medical doctor uses her passions to help people and she spoke to SunBuzz about how she does it. She was crowned last month at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni and has been using her time as the reigning queen to do the work that’s close to her heart. “Miss International South Africa has given me the opportunity to do what I love on an international scale. As a doctor, people come to you at their weakest and most vulnerable in search for a solution and restoration of their life. “I have seen and experienced so much with so many people in our country. It has taught me that we are not meant to be alone but are meant to work in unity to create equality,” she said.

Because of what I have experienced in my career, I have chosen to change that, to fill gaps in our field that I can make a difference in, to focus on the areas that go unnoticed and to give back to people, departments, hospitals, and communities that have made me the doctor I am today,” she continued. When asked how she juggles medicine and being a beauty queen, she said they are both her calling, which made it easy. “Both roles require hard work and perseverance, which come with no sleep and are sometimes a lonely journey. When I see that what I do has an impact on society and creates colossal effects for the betterment of others, I know that this is where I’m meant to be.” She is also passionate about young women and she urged them to find their purpose. “Be brave, believe in yourself and be true to who you are,” she said. She will be representing Mzansi at Miss International 2022 in Thailand later in the year.
