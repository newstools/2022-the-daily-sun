The second season of the much-loved show, which is hosted by seasoned radio host Thuso Motaung will premiere on Wednesday, 5 February. Ntate Thuso, as he is affectionately known by his followers, told SunBuzz that viewers can expect fireworks in the new season, adding that nothing much will change in the new season. “The new season promises to resolve more dramas in marriages and leave couples happy. We are going to continue where we left off and get more couples to reconcile and offer them the help they need,” he said. He said he was happy when the show got the green light for a second season. “I was over the moon when I was told that we’re getting a second season because it’s always exciting when you invest time into your craft and it reaps great rewards.” ALSO READ : RADIO STATION GETS LIFELINE AFTER LOOTING Ntate Thuso, whose TV show became an instant hit, said he owes the success of Lenyalo Le Thatha to proper investment and passion. “I treat each situation with the respect it deserves. These days people portray marriage as some form of prison but if this institution is given the honour it deserves, it thrives. People need to put God at the centre of their marriages.” He said that presenting the show has been a blissful experience for him. “I have enjoyed it and we have laughed and sometimes cried making each episode. I’ve shared the wisdom I have gained along the way in my life and nothing leaves joy in my heart than leaving and seeing couples happy,” he said. Ntate Thuso also shared some advice and said that in a union, communication is key. “A lot of the couples are not talking. People need to start talking, the very same way they did when they met,” he said.
