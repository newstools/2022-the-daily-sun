NORTH West MEC for Education Mmaphefo Mmatsemela visited boarding schools around Rustenburg where Tirelong Secondary School pupils are placed on Friday, 14 January. On Wednesday, the school could not welcome back pupils. Parents went on a protest demanding mobile classes instead of relocating pupils. This comes after the school was vandalised during the school holidays. The parents finally agreed to allow the relocation of the pupils to boarding schools. They signed the consent forms which gave permission to the department to relocate pupils to the boarding schools. Pupils of Tirelong have been placed in the three Mega Farm schools of Moedwil, Naawpoort and Boons. One of the grade 12 pupils said they were adjusting well. “It’s a new environment for us. However, what is important is for us to learn and pass our matric,” she said. “We appreciate the efforts made by the department to ensure that we don’t stay behind with our school work.” She added that they will work hard in their studies. “We promise not to disappoint the department, parents and ourselves.” MEC Matsemela assured parents that pupils will be safe and taken care of at the boarding schools. “I wish to assure all parents that their children are in safe hands,” she said. “We will ensure that pupils who missed days of learning are provided with a recovery programme. Our teachers are waiting to give them the best support.”
