THE Wife actor Lindah Majola has bagged his first presenting gig on SABC1. He will be hosting a new show called Wedding Chefs, which is expected to start airing next month. Lindah (25) from Bonela in Durban, is not just an actor, but a man of many talents. He is an aspiring restaurateur, a content creator and a TikTok star. On the new Showmax telenovela, The Wife, he plays Langa. He graduated cum laude with a diploma in catering management at the Durban University of Technology. In January 2020, he started his own food truck called Humble Cafe, which is located near his home in Bonela. They specialise in American style fast food and their speciality dish is the chicken cheesesteak. Speaking about his new show, Lindah said it was produced by Sothar Pictures for SABC1. “We have finished shooting the first season of the show, which was in Gauteng,” he said. The ecstatic Lindah said that he was scouted by the channel and he sent through his audition tape to the production company. “When I was appointed as the host of the show, I had an overwhelming feeling of gratitude. To have a show that is in line with what I studied on one of the biggest channels in South Africa is amazing. I have God to thank for it,” he said. Lindah said the show is a completely new concept on television and they needed a fresh face. “I had no idea what I was going to do but the team helped me to be confident in front on the camera. “What I love the most about the show is meeting the beautiful couples who have decided to spend their lives together. I love witnessing love,” he said.
