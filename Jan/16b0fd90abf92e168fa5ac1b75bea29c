LEGENDARY actor and activist Patrick Shai was a phone call away from his loved ones. Now that he is no more, he is a prayer away whenever his family needs him. That was according to his son Kopano Shai, who was speaking at his funeral service at the Soweto Theatre on Saturday, 29 January. Kopano and his siblings went to the podium to share the fond memories they had with their father.    “Papa loved deeply. He would kiss you in front of people that you don’t want him to kiss you in front of. He loved jokes. He could turn any situation into a fun one. He was our dancer and fashionista, and always thought he could sing,” Kopano said. He also said it had not yet sunk in that his dad had become their angel. “There are terms that he would use; that he was a phone call away. Shai, you’ve become a prayer away,” he added. Scores of people gathered to bid farewell to the veteran actor, who was described by many as a dancer, great father, friend and someone who liked to share jokes. Patrick’s wife, Masechaba Shai, recorded a moving tribute for her husband, played at the funeral. “I think right now I am confused. I’m still thinking that you can walk in and do the usual. It is hard to even find words; honestly, I don't know where to begin. This is a message I never thought I’d be saying. I really can’t say goodbye ntwana. We’ve had our laughter, challenges and so many things we were dealing with. We had plans and I knew you wanted to do something for me. To wake up with the realisation that you are no more is hard. Your children and I will always remember your laughter and how you wanted the best for them; how you used to video-call your grandchildren and buy them toys,” she said.    She added that though she and her husband fought and disagreed on many things, they had the common goal of wanting nothing but the best for their children. “We wanted them to be better than us and not copy the bad habits, but only the good ones.” Shai was laid to rest at Westpark Cemetery.
