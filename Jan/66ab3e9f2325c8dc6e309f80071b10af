WHEN mkhulu Mishack Mahlangu visited his wife’s grave on 24 December, he made a shocking discovery. The 67-year-old from Tweefontein, Mpumalanga, said he found a strange tombstone on his wife Martha Mbonani’s grave at Einel graveyard. Mishack told Daily Sun the information on the tombstone didn’t correspond to his wife’s information. The person the tombstone was made for was born in 1985 and died in 1992, while his wife was born in 1958 and died in 1996. He said the tombstone was erected after his last visit to the grave last April. “When I came here in April, there was nothing but now I’ve found a tombstone and we don’t even know who erected it,” he said. Mishack said his family was planning to erect a tombstone but didn’t have the money. He said he has been going around the area asking if anyone knew who put up the tombstone, but with no luck. Mishack said he has been visiting his wife’s grave for many years and had long suspected something was wrong. His son Koos (43) said he was shocked to find a strange tombstone on his mother’s grave. He said during previous visits, the grave had been cleaned but he assumed other family members did it. He now suspected whoever erected the tombstone has been cleaning the grave. “We know it might be difficult for them to come forward and admit they made a mistake, but we are appealing to them to come and remove it. They must try and find the correct grave because this will cause problems,” he said. Koos said they had not reported the matter to the authorities yet.
