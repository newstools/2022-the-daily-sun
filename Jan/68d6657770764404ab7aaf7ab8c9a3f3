TAXI drivers are not often thought of as a target market for herbal tea. However, Yanga Mphahlwa from Gugulethu, Cape Town, is making a living by selling cups of tea to them. The 25-year-old wakes up every morning at about 7am to brew his tea. He sells it until lunchtime. He said the idea came to him when he realised people didn’t have time to make tea. “I started selling sachets in 2020 and although I had customers, some would say they didn’t have time to make it. In 2021, I decided to make it for them,” he said. “I brew the tea and then put it in a flask. I sell a tumbler for R6 and a sachet for R20. My customers don’t need to get out of their cars to buy from me.” Yanga said although a lot of people supported him, most of his customers were Avanza drivers. He said the tea helped to detox and deal with stomach acid. “I work from Monday to Saturday and if you drink this tea on an empty stomach, it does wonders,” he said. An Avanza driver said the tea helped him with his feet. “My feet were sore but I felt much better when I drank the tea,” he said. Another driver said the tea helped him with hangovers. Yanga is selling the tea to raise money for a driver’s licence.
