THREE days before the death of his father, Patrick Shai’s son Kopano Shai came out guns blazing against the videos of his father that went viral. He took to social media and spoke about how his father’s videos were an embarrassment to him and his family. Kopano also said that videos in which his father was challenging rapper Cassper Nyovest had put his family in a compromising situation. In a Facebook post that has since been deleted, Kopano said: “I understand the impact that is has on him as a brand equally on myself as an establishing brand. “His actions of carelessness and selfishness has put myself and family under a compromising position. He added: “The embarrassment is severe to a point of no expression. I’m where I am asking myself questions like what happened to the doors I’m knocking on.
