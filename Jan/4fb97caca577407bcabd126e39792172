WEST Ham United began the new year in the same manner as they saw out the last, with an impressive away victory as they beat Crystal Palace 3-2 in the Premier League on Saturday. Manuel Lanzini scored twice at Selhurst Park, before a late rally from the home side with two late goals, as fifth-placed West Ham moved within a point of fourth-placed Arsenal. David Moyes’ side, the surprise package of the season, took the lead in the 22nd minute with Michail Antonio sliding in to poke home a wonderful cross from Said Benrahma. Three minutes later, the Hammers made it 2-0 with an outstanding finish from Lanzini, who flicked the ball to his left foot and volleyed home after good work from Declan Rice. Lanzini made it three just before the break, drilling home a penalty after a VAR review found that Luka Milivojevic had handled in the box. Palace got a goal back in the 83rd minute when Odsonne Edouard stretched to turn in a fine cross from substitute Michael Olise, who then scored himself in the 90th minute with a free-kick. West Ham are on 34 points, one more than Tottenham Hotspur and three ahead of Manchester United although both those teams have two games in hand. XREUTERS
