TWO men and a woman were arrested for fraud and corruption in City Deep, Joburg on Friday, 28 January. According to Colonel Dimakatso Sello, they were bust by the K9 unit, together with organised crime narcotics. She said members followed up on intelligence information about people diverting goods to avoid paying custom duties and VAT. “The information led the police to a storage facility in City Deep where a consignment of poultry meat weighing 27 000kg was found loaded in a truck. The two men were arrested for contravention of the Customs and Excise Act, fraud and corruption. One of the suspects initiated a bribe of R800 000 to members to evade arrest. The woman who brought the cash was also arrested for corruption.” Sello also said on further investigation, police were led to another company also suspected of defrauding the South African Revenue Service. “Upon searching the premises, four containers containing imported poultry meat were recovered and the owner could not produce legal papers.” Sello said Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela applauded the police for their commitment to fighting corruption and exposing those who try bribing cops. “The positive attitude, honesty and integrity displayed by members through upholding and enforcing the law as mandated by the Constitution is commendable.” said Mawela.
