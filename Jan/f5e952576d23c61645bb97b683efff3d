RAGING flames have burnt down shacks belonging to two families, leaving them with nothing but the clothes on their backs. The fire broke out in the Siyanda area, near KwaMashu, north of Durban, on Saturday, 29 January. Although the families said they were not sure what could’ve started the flames, they suspected an electrical fault. A member of one of the families, Fikephi Mkhize (58), told Daily Sun she was in church when she got a call informing her about a fire at her home. “I rushed home and found that all the six shacks in our yard were burnt down,” she said. “My children who were at home said the fire came from one of the rooms and they tried to get belongings from inside the shack but they couldn’t get in because the flames were too big,” she said. “We are a family of 13 members and we had six shacks. “We lost clothes, birth certificates, children’s uniforms and other important things as well as our furniture,” she said. “I’m heartbroken and can’t imagine how I will start afresh in building new shacks. “I’m hoping that we get help soon,” she said. Councillor Nhlanhla Malandela said he contacted the eThekwini Municipality disaster management team who would assist the families. “As they’ve lost all their important documents such as the IDs and birth certificates I’ll also arrange for them to get help in that regard,” he said.
