THE N3 in Pietermaritzburg was a no-go area due to ongoing protests on the corner of Masukwana and Jabu Ndlovu Streets Thursday morning, 27 January. But later on the day the N3 was open and traffic was flowing in both directions. This is not the first protest on the N3 in the area. Last year, truck drivers blockaded the highway venting their anger at the hiring of foreign nationals as drivers. Reports indicate that the protesters had barricaded the off-ramp entrance onto Masukwana and Dr Chota Motala streets. Several roads in the Pietermaritzburg CBD had also been blockaded, causing major traffic jams in the city. There were also reports and video footage showing protesters allegedly throwing rocks from a bridge and onto the N3. A resident said it’s very sad because a group unhappy people have disturbed many people in the area. “Some people ended up not going to work because of this blockage. And if it continues people will not go to work and they will lose their jobs,” said the resident. Another resident said it wasn’t yet clear what the protesters wanted. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “We can confirm that on 27 January at 2pm, police officers responded to a report of a protest action on the N3 towards Pietermaritzburg from the Scottsburg area and are currently on scene to monitor the situation.” Mbele said no injuries and no damages to property have occurred.
