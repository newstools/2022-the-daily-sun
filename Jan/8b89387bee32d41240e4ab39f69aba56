THE 34-year-old woman took out a protection order against her alleged abusive lover last November because she didn’t want to die a gender-based violence victim and leave her three kids alone. But she was stabbed to death allegedly by the father of her children, from whom she has separated. The mother, originally from Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was stabbed three times in the chest two hours before the New Year on Friday night in Matiko Xikaya Village outside Phalaborwa, Limpopo. Her father (69) said his daughter separated from her lover of 14 years in November, complaining that he was physically abusive. “He was beating and insulting her in front of their children. She didn’t want to have anything do with him anymore, so she reported him to the police,” he said. “It’s really painful. His aim was to kill her and nothing else.” He said his daughter was a pillar of strength to their family, because she was very reliable. “It’s breaking my heart to think that her children are now without parents because now their father must face the music and rot in jail for killing their mother,” the heartbroken grandfather told Daily Sun. The woman was found bleeding on the floor and was declared dead at the scene by medical workers. She was working at a creche and renting a place to stay in the village. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the 35-year-old murder suspect was arrested two hours after the incident. He said: “The suspect had taken a vehicle to Tzaneen but the police saw a vehicle matching the description given along the R71 road towards Tzaneen and it was pulled oer. The suspect was immediately arrested and the probable murder weapon confiscated.” The suspect will appear today, 3 January in the Lulekani Magistrates Court on a charge of murder. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe has praised the cops for their swift response and for arresting the suspect soon after the crime.
