TV ACTOR Mangaliso Ngema is calling for government intervention after he drove into a swarm of locusts. In a shared video, thousands of locusts can be seen blocking his way, as they fly all over. He can be heard complaining he can’t even see where he’s going. Some of the insects got inside his car and got stuck in there. He said: “The locust swarms in the Northern Cape and the Free State are a big problem for farmers. I’d only heard of them in the news, but I saw for myself this past weekend. Our government needs to step up the help to farmers, otherwise we are all in trouble.” In another post, he showed locusts trying to get out of his car. He then wrote: “This was the result of driving through the swarm of locusts.” The video shocked his friends and followers.

What is God saying that we’re not getting?” Sam Khumalo said: “This is definitely a symbol. God is speaking. Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying.” Masiya said: “Exodus 10. God will always warn his people before something terrible comes. I’m not preaching, however this reminds me of what happened to Pharaoh when he decided not to listen to God.” Thembani Mbasa dismissed all this, saying: “It’s just their time. Don’t start with Bushiri’s type of thinking again. God loves us so great including those locusts. It’s their time and it will pass. Like any season of all fruit and vegetables or weather, us who can eat them dearly wish they were closer. When I was growing up it was so difficult for me to catch them, specifically those ones in the video. They were the very best but I couldn’t catch them because they were few and very fast. I wish it was happening to me.” Victor said: “I see food.” A post shared by Mangaliso J Ngema (@mangaliso_ngema)
