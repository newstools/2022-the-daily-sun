SIYA Kolisi is the SA Rugby Player of the Year for 2021, after the popular Springbok captain garnered the most votes for his performances during a tough season. The exciting Aphelele Fassi underlined his great potential by winning the Young Player of the Year award. The awards were announced yesterday. The 30-year-old Kolisi edged out strong challenges from his national teammates Lukhanyo Am, Damian de Allende, Eben Etzebeth and Makazole Mapimpi to become the first Boks captain since Jean de Villiers in 2013 to win the top award. Kolisi – who was named the MTN Springbok of the Castle Lager Lions Series last year and was the only Springbok to start all 13 Tests in 2021 – led South Africa to a superb series victory over the British & Irish Lions in August. He went on to captain the side under difficult circumstances in the Castle Lager Rugby Championship, which culminated with a nail-biting win over the All Blacks. Fassi made his Springboks debut in 2021 and featured in two Tests. Meanwhile, Bulls director of rugby, Jake White, and exciting loose-forward, Elrigh Louw, scooped the SA Rugby Coach of the Year and Carling Currie Cup Player of the Year awards for 2021, respectively. SA Rugby announced the winners of the prestigious rugby awards yesterday. White emerged as the winner in the coaching category, where he was nominated alongside Springbok mentor, Jacques Nienaber, and Springbok Sevens coach, Neil Powell. Louw’s performances in a successful season for the Bulls were recognised as he beat teammate, Johan Goosen, and Stormers’ Evan Roos for the Carling Currie Cup Player of the Year award.
