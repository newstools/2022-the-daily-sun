A 29-YEAR-OLD man was arrested at the KwaMashu Men’s Hostel on Tuesday, 4 January. Nkosiyazi Maphumulo appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court for hijacking and possession of an unlicensed firearm. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said on Tuesday, cops went to KwaMashu Men’s Hostel after receiving information that a hijacked vehicle was seen on Jabula Road at the hostel. On arrival, they spotted the car with three occupants, and it was intercepted. “Two suspects managed to flee the scene on foot and ran towards the shacks. The driver was searched and was found in possession of a .38 Revolver with its serial numbers erased and 14 rounds of ammunition,” said Mbele. She said the suspect was arrested and charged for carjacking and possession of an unlicensed firearm, and the recovered firearm will be subjected to ballistic testing. “The vehicle was hijacked on the same day from an e-hailing driver who received a requested trip to Newlands East when he was robbed of the vehicle, including his belongings, by the suspects on his arrival,” said Mbele. The suspect was kept in jail until 12 January for further investigation.
