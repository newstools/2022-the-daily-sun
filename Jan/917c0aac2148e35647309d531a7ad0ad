THE MZIMBA family in Cottondale outside Acornhoek in Mpumalanga is reeling over their son’s mysterious disappearance. Bheki Mzimba’s disappearance caused a stir in the village, leading to a protest by residents. Bheki’s worried dad Solomon Mzimba (74) told Daily Sun they last saw him serving customers at his spaza shop on Friday late afternoon, 14 January, before closing. He stayed in a three-roomed house near his shop. Solomon said he and his younger son Musa knocked on Bheki’s door on Saturday morning but there was no answer. “Realising that he was not answering, we started checking and saw that his bedroom window was open. Musa then peeped through the window and we couldn’t believe our eyes, seeing fresh blood stains on the floor. But Bheki wasn’t there. We then called the police,” said Solomon. His shocked mother, Elsie Mazibila (54), said she had gone to wake Bheki up to greet him as normal. “But there was no answer. I then ran back home to alert his father. Before his disappearance, Bheki used to say that some people, whom he eats with, would betray him. We didn’t take his words seriously. Now he’s gone. A sangoma told us he is still alive but his kidnappers are torturing him,” said Elsie. Musa said the police arrived and conducted a search but found nothing. “We have searched for him at our relatives, hospitals and mortuaries. My brother has short deadlocks. He was wearing red and white Adidas sneakers, blue denim shorts and a red and white long-sleeved shirt when we last saw him,” said Musa. Captain Mpho Nonyane said a missing person’s case has been opened. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the suspects or the victim can contact the Acornhoek police on 013 795 8913 or acting branch commander Captain Tabodi Sekgobela on 082 318 9925.
