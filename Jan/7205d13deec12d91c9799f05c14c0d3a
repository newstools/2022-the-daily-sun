LINGELETHU West police are investigating a murder case after a body of an unidentified man was found on Sunday, 30 January at about 07.57am on Spine Road in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Captain FC Van Wyk said when the police arrived at the scene, they found the man on his back with a stab wound to the left side of his stomach. “Circumstances surrounding his death are under investigation and according to reports police were informed telephonically by an unknown person of a body lying on the side of the road on Spine Road,” said Van Wyk. He said it seemed as if the dead man was killed elsewhere because there was no blood or signs of struggle at the scene. Anyone with information about the case is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Thandiswa Mbita (45) said crime in Cape Town was too high. “We are at the mercy of criminals. They do what they want when they want and they know nothing will happen to them,” said Thandiswa. She said there were a lot of bodies being dumped in Khayelitsha. “People have been calling Khayelitsha a jungle but they are contributing to it because they kill people and dump their bodies here,” said Thandiswa. Just a few weeks ago, bodies were found in Monwabisi beach and some of the dead people are not known in Khayelitsha. Another resident said everyone who has a family member missing must go to Lingelethu West Police Station. He said people were afraid of visiting Khayelitsha because of incidents like these. “It is not easy for Khayelitsha people to fight this because these bodies are dumped here at night and even police can not fight this, so we are in deep trouble,” said the resident.
