Premier Soccer League prosecutor, Zola Majavu, has charged Orlando Pirates for the incident in which TS Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi was denied entry to the field and change rooms in a match at Orlando Stadium. The much-publicised incident took place on 11 December, where there was an off-field controversy between the officials of the two clubs.Galaxy’s media officer Minenhle Mkhize alleged that he was slapped in the face by his Pirates counterpart Thandi Merafe on the same day, and he opened a case with the police. In the latest update from the PSL, Majavu confirmed that Pirates are set for a hearing on Wednesday next week concerning the event.“Orlando Pirates FC was charged yesterday and their matter has been enrolled for hearing at 2pm on Wednesday 26 January,” Majavu said on Thursday night. “This is in relation to the misconduct arising from the chairman of TS Galaxy being denied entry into the stadium. The charges proffered against Orlando Pirates relate to that incident. Majavu continued: “When it is finalised, at whatever date and time, once again I will come back and provide a further update on the outcome of the DC hearing.” This is the kind of treatment we are subjected to at Orlando Stadium. They don't want to allow our President to access the field but he has an accreditation that allows him to be in the field.#Siyadumuza#TheRockets#TSG pic.twitter.com/W4U8eWaTRQ
