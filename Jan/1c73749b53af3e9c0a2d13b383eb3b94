MEDIA personality Unathi Nkayi has set social media abuzz after a video of her dancing in a bikini alongside Minnie Dlamini and other women started making the rounds on social media. This has left many people drooling over her body, with many going as far as to say that she may be Mzansi’s hottest woman currently. The ladies on holiday in Cape Town were captured doing the Nkao Tempela dance challenge. Although many were praising the 44-year-old for her hot body, there were also those who questioned how it was possible for Unathi to be hotter than Minnie, but they were quickly shunned down, with many saying people needed to stop making comparisons between the two as it was toxic.

It stems from an unhealthy upbringing where you were constantly compared to kids next door.” Mabusi said: “Y’all know you can praise Unathi’s body and moves without mentioning uMinnie. . . Besides the girl just had a baby not so long ago, so babies keep you busy vele ngeke ubene ne energy. What gets to me is Minnie still looks better than most y’alls sisters and gfs maar ni busy niyarasa.” A post shared by Unathi.Africa (@unathi.co)
