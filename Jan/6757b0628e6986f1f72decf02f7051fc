SUSPENDED
ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule’s planned visit to Musina for a parallel
party January 8 activity has been canned. This was
after the ANC Vhembe region directed a Musina Sumandila branch to suspend the
planned visit in the area by Magashule. Regional
secretary Rudzani Ludere told Daily Sun the branch has responded to the
directive to cancel Magashule’s visit. “Yes, they
have responded (to the directive). They have cancelled it and Magashule is not
in Musina today as we speak,” he said. It came to
light on Thursday that Magashule, who as part of his suspension conditions, is
not permitted to attend or organise ANC meetings or gatherings. The ANC is
in the province which is hosting the January 8 celebrations and Magashule has
been frozen out from the party. He was
scheduled to be hosted by the Sumandila branch in Musina and the region has now
come to direct the branch form hosting him. National executive committee member
Nomvula Mokonyane on Thursday distanced the party from Magashule’s event. The Vhembe
region in a directive reminded the Sumandila branch that the NEC in suspending
Magashule has resolved that he is not allowed to attend or represent the party
in any activities. “Your
activity is inconsistent with the prescripts of the constitution of the ANC as
adopted at the 54th national conference, in particular rule 25." read the
directive. "Based
on the decision of the national executive committee, your branch is directed to
suspend the visit of comrade Ace Magashule scheduled for 7 January. 2022.”
