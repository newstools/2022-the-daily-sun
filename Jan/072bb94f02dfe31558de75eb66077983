TWO Pakistani traders almost lost their lives after they were viciously attacked by a gang of criminals. The incident took place at their shops in Hluvukani in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge on Tuesday, 11 January at around 7pm.

The thugs left the two for dead as they robbed them and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash. “I was busy serving customers when the gang of four accosted me with guns and demanded money for protecting our businesses from the tsotsis. They looted the R3 000 cash from the till. But it was not enough. They battered me with gun butts, bricks and stones and stabbed me with broken beer bottles. Realising they were going to kill me, I ask them accompany me to my friend Faizal’s shop nearby so he would help me out with extra cash,” said Hayat. But they quickly turned on Faizal when they didn’t get the money. “ The gang stabbed me with broken beer bottles as they hit me with bricks, stones and gun butts dragging Hayat and I from the shop onto the cold street. “They continued assaulting us in the view of the public. They threw Hayat into the car and drove off with him,” said Faizal. Hayat was later thrown off the moving car in the outskirts of Share Village outside Hluvukani.
