PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa says a man has been taken for questioning in connection with the blaze that gutted Parliament. Ramaphosa visited Parliament this afternoon, 2 January, joining Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille, deputy state security minister Zizi Kodwa and other MPs who were on the ground since the morning. The president said a person has been taken for questioning in connection with the incident. “This is an important national key asset of our government. Of course we are still going into what caused the fire started in Old Assembly and how then did it move to the National Assembly. I believe somebody right now is being questioned.” Ramaphosa said it was devastating and sad that Parliament burnt down a day after celebrating the life of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose funeral was held on Saturday. He said if he was still alive, Tutu would have been devastated. Ramaphosa said Speaker of Parliament Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula was on her way from Eastern Cape by road after she couldn’t get a plane to come to Cape Town. He thanked the firefighters, saying if it were not for them, the damage could have been worse. Cape Town MMC of safety and security Jean-Pierre Smith said Parliament fire detectors only activated once firefighters were already on the scene fighting the fire. “The smoke detection equipment took quite a while to activate so the fire was active with the fire staff at the scene before that system activated. We have reported that to Parliamentary staff. We are blessed, no injuries, no fatalities from the fire,” said Smith. At mid day Smith announced the fire was still not yet contained.
