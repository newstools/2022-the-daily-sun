SINGER Brenden Praise and his influencer wife Mpoomy Ledwaba are celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary in Zanzibar, Tanzania. The two have been sharing photos of their holiday on social media, and have looking back on their wedding day, which Mpoomy said cost R10 000. “This day five years ago I was 22 and turning 23 in a few days. My tummy was runny, and I was a little worried about how my Zulu uncles would treat my very gentle Pedi family. My sister-in-law @palesankuna pretty much held it down (well she had no choice) whether our lobola was successful or not, we were set to marry the next evening at 6pm. Our entire wedding cost R10 000 including our outfits, and we pretty much didn’t know what we were eating after the wedding,” she wrote.

Anyway, I’m rambling and just grateful… It’s been a journey and a half,” she wrote. Brenden said the time he has spent with Mpoomy has been the best of his life. “I’ve come to realise that time isn’t constant, sometimes it feels longer than others, in moments that take our breath away we feel time moves too quickly. In moments of pain, it never seems to end. My time spent with you has been the best use of my life, and these past five years have felt like time has flown by, but only because you’ve constantly taken my breath away, and all I ask for is as much time with you as humanly possible, I love Mrs Ledwaba. Happy five years anniversary,” wrote Brenden. See photos from their holiday below.
