RECORD breaker, Cristiano Ronaldo said he plans on turning his Best Fifa Football Special Award into extra motivation to help Portugal qualify for the World Cup finals later this year. Ronaldo was honoured with a special award at The Best Fifa ceremony on Monday for breaking the men’s record for scoring the most international goals. He has scored 115 goals for Portugal. After the award ceremony, Ronaldo took to Instagram to thank Fifa for recognising him as the top goal scorer in the history of Fifa competitions. He said winning the Fifa Special Best Award is a tremendous honour and a huge privilege. “The fact that such a relevant institution chose to recognise me as the top goal scorer in the history of Fifa competitions is, for me, the pinnacle of my individual achievements in the representation of my beloved country,” he said. He said he also plans on using the award as extra motivation in the upcoming World Cup play-off matches in March against Italy so that Portugal can qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. “We can all keep writing this amazing story together,” he added. He extended words of gratitude to all the players who played alongside him since he began playing for Portugal. “Last but not least, a special word to all the tremendous players that represented Portugal by my side over the last two decades, and to all the international players that I faced so many times all around the globe. Your talent, your professionalism, and your quality always contributed to making me a better player. Thank you!”  he said.
