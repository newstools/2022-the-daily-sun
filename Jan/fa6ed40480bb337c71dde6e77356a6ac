COUNCILLOR Ryder Mkhutswana fears for his life. The councillor of ward 97 in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, said hitmen were paid R25 000 to kill him but changed their minds as they knew him and his son. He said they tipped him off that someone wanted him dead and warned him to watch his back. The ANC councillor showed the SunTeam a message sent to him on 8 December by one of the hitmen, who said he was hired to kill him and his friend. Mkhutswana said if his ancestors and God had not protected him, he would have died in December. “They knew me because I have been a councillor before and I’m a people’s person. Some of them even know my son, so they decided against killing me,” he said. ALSO READ |
GOGO (127) GOD CAN TAKE, I’VE LIVED! Mkhutswana said the hitmen told him the people who had paid him were three women and a man. He said he was given some of their names. He confronted them and informed the police. He said he may have stepped on some people’s toes when he was elected in November. “There are people who were using public infrastructure for their personal enrichment and I stopped it. I know I stepped on their toes because they threatened there would be a by-election soon. A by-election can only happen if a councillor is dead or has been removed, so they wanted me out,” he said.
