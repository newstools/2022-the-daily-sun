One of the men convicted of killing 83-year-old Belgian national, Reverend Joseph Hollanders, has been sentenced to an effective 30 years in jail. Thabang Maseko, 24, was sentenced on Friday by the North West High Court in Mahikeng. His co-accused Mongezi Molefe, 27, was slapped with a three-year jail term. The accused's sentencing came after Hollanders’s body was discovered at his house within church premises on 13 January 2020 at Bodibe Village, North West. "The reverend's body was discovered by a community member who alerted the police. Hollanders' hands and feet were tied-up," said police spokesperson Captain Aafje Botma. Three days later, police arrested three suspects linking them to the crime. The suspects were arrested in Bodibe village in possession of the victim's cellphone. Botma said Maseko was eventually found guilty of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Molefe was only convicted of theft. The third accused was found not guilty. "Maseko was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for murder, for robbery with aggravating circumstances he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment - of which five years will be added to the sentence of murder, while 10 years will run concurrently with 30 years. He will serve an effective 30-year jail term. "Molefe was sentenced to three years direct imprisonment for theft," said Botma.
