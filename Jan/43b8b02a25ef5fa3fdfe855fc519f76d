IFP founder Mangosuthu Buthelezi says the fire at Parliament has left him devastated. He said as someone who had spent 28 years as an MP, the fire was not just the loss of a structure but a heritage asset that could never be replaced. Buthelezi said he couldn’t believe his eyes when he first saw footage of flames rising from the building. “There was great concern over the Keiskamma Tapestry, invaluable art works and original documents. My biggest fear was that the fire would extend to the library of Parliament,” he said. Buthelezi said when news broke that a second fire had started, he knew the damage would be devastating. “In the aftermath, it’s hard to reconcile the image of a burnt and hollow shell with the hallowed chamber in which our country’s history has played out for some 40 years,” he said. Buthelezi entered the National Assembly for the first time in 1994 as the first democratic minister of home affairs. “I remember president Nelson Mandela taking the podium for the first time and the honourable Frene Ginwala leading proceedings in the house as speaker. “When I think of the past 28 years of my life and how much of it has been spent in that chamber, I cannot believe that it no longer exists,” he said. Buthelezi said the country had lost a symbol of its strength and unity. “On behalf of the IFP and all my colleagues who serve in the National Assembly, I want to express our deepest gratitude to all those who have been working tirelessly to fight the blaze, to protect the remainder of the parliamentary precinct and to find hot spots that could potentially flare again,” he said. “We hope there is no further flare-up, so a full investigation can begin as soon as possible.”
