THREE suspects aged between 15 and 20 were bust after robbing taxi passengers. The incident happened on Saturday, 22 January when a taxi was travelling from Mmakaunyane to Mabopane Station in Tshwane at 5.35am. Warrant Officer Tembi Nowathe of Dube Police Station said the driver of a white Nyathi stopped after three men caught the taxi as passengers. Nowathe said the taxi was already ferrying two occupants and then picked up another passenger on the road. “After some time, the three suspects started to act strangely and took out a firearm and ordered everyone to give them cash and their valuables before getting off the taxi.” She said the driver then called the owner immediately, who alerted the police and together with taxi association members, searched for the suspects around Mmakaunyane and managed to bust all three and recovered a toy gun allegedly used during the taxi robbery. “All three suspects, aged between 15 and 20 years old, were linked to cases of house robberies reported around Dube, whereby residents were terrorised during the night.” Nowathe said the recovered stolen items included schoolbags, wallets, cellphones and cosmetics. The three will appear in court soon.
