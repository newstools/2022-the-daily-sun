THE husband accused of hiring four hitmen to kill his wife is bankrupt and can’t afford a legal representative anymore. Thabo Leshabane’s Advocate Sam Mamalabo dumped him just before the start of his in the Limpopo High Court, Polokwane on Friday, 21 January. Leshabane allegedly hired hitmen from Germiston, Ekurhuleni, to kill his wife Makoena Leshabane (47) and her business partner Tebogo Mphuti (46). The two were shot by four armed men in Polokwane last October while sitting in their Mercedes-Benz. Mamabolo told Daily Sun he couldn’t continue representing Leshabane because he couldn’t afford the legal fees for court. Alleged hitmen Ndondo Buthelezi (25), John Zulu (30), Bhekimuzi Phiyose (34) and Thembelani Dlamini (30) were bust two weeks after the murders in different areas around Germiston. Leshabane was bust at a hospital in Midrand, Gauteng, after allegedly trying to kill himself. The court had to postpone the matter to Friday, 28 January to allow the suspect to get a representative from Legal Aid. NPA spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzangi said the four other accused were represented by a Legal Aid lawyer, but Leshabane needed his own lawyer to avoid a conflict of interest. “It’s hard out there so the court gave him a full week to get a legal representative from the Legal Aid.”
