NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has refused to be drawn into speculations that the cause of the parliament precinct fire was arson. Mzansi woke to the horror news of Parliament being on fire on Sunday, January 2, sparking rumours that this could be a deliberate attack on the house, a national key point and heritage site that is guarded around the clock. This is not the first time it’s caught fire. Last March it caught fire and it was later revealed an electric fault started it. Mapisa-Nqakula said recommendations from a report after that incident were being implemented. She, however, said it was too early to entertain unconfirmed reports of what really started the fire or which documents could have been destroyed. “Parliament is on fire. Right now the National Assembly itself is on fire, I can confirm that. On a matter which has been raised, which talks to documents in Parliament, I hate to speculate. “I would rather give you facts about what has transpired because right now we are informed that indeed there was fire on the side of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) and now in the National Assembly, and that there is fire now in the National Assembly itself. “But one would also be interested to understand what happened between the NCOP building, that entire passage, which has offices and other offices and libraries, right up to the National Assembly, whether there was fire in that area,” she said. Mapisa-Nqakula, who updated the nation virtually as she was trying to get a flight to Cape Town so she could be on the ground, said it would be irresponsible of her to speculate whether any documents have been damaged by the fire. She also said the blaze wouldn’t affect the State of the Nation Address scheduled for 10 February, when President Cyril Ramaphosa traditionally outlines government’s programme for the year.
