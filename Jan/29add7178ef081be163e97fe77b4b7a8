FORMER Marumo Gallants assistant coach Jean-Francois Losciuto has joined Ferroviario de Maputo in Mozambique. The Belgium-born coach has penned a two-year deal with the Mozambique side, who finished seventh this past season that ended last month. “Yes, I have been appointed as the coach of Ferroviario de Maputo in Mozambique,” confirmed Losciuto. Losciuto is returning to club’s management after he was sacked by Gallants last October along with head coach Sebastian Migne for “insubordination and using abusive language towards the club’s technical, Director Harris Choeu,” said Gallants at the time. With Migne gone, the future of Losciuto was up in the air since he was brought in by Migne. He then left the club who appointed Dan Malesela as Migne’s replacement. Losciuto previously coached Black Leopards from December 2016 until November 2017. In his first season with the Limpopo side, he helped Lidoda Duvha finish second in the GladAfrica Championship behind winners Thanda Royal Zulu. But after he failed to help Leopards gain promotion to the Premiership via the promotion/relation play-offs at the end of that season, he was sacked by Leopards in November 2017. However, he was quickly appointed by Richards Bay in the same month.
