PARENTS from across the country have come out in support of One SA Movement leader Mmusi Maimane’s petition to raise the matric pass mark from 30% to 50%. Maimane said South Africa had a youth unemployment crisis and could not allow educational standards to be so low. “A meagre 30% pass hurts our pupils, the education system and in the long run, the economy,” he said. Maimane said the pass mark also undermined the intellect of South Africa’s youth, allowed education leaders to escape accountability and created a culture of low expectations. “We call on Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga to increase the matric pass mark to 50%. We must equip our young people to compete and win in the global economy and they can with quality education. This begins by upping the matric pass mark,” Maimane said. The SunTeam went out to engage with ordinary people about the issue and many said they agreed with Maimane.  Parent Lucky Nsebele (50) said the low pass mark meant kids failed to adjust when they went to university. He said if the mark was increased, pupils might be motivated to work harder. Joyce Ramokone (48) from Temba in Hammanskraal said she fully supported the petition. Joyce said in the olden days, the pass mark was 50% and she didn’t understand why it was reduced. “These kids are clueless. They don’t know anything. When they get to tertiary, they fail,” she said. Sabelo Matlhaga (33) from Unit D in Hammanskraal said he felt the pass mark was killing pupils. Education department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga previously said the mark would not be increased because the system aimed to encourage different levels of achievement.
