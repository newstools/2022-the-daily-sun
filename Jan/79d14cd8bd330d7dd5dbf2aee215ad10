The South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau of the Hawks in the Western Cape arrested a 35-year-old man on the N1 near Beaufort West on Friday after allegedly finding drugs with an estimated street value of R1.2 million in a vehicle. The Beaufort West K9 Unit and Beaufort West Flying Squad arrested the man during a joint operation. "The team stopped a white truck at a vehicle checkpoint on the N1 highway near Beaufort West. It was travelling from Johannesburg and was destined for Cape Town. A search of the truck was conducted, and two brown boxes containing 20 000 suspected mandrax tablets were found and seized for further investigation," said Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani. The man is due to appear in the Beaufort West Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of dealing in illicit drugs.
