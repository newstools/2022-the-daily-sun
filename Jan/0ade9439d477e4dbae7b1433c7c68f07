GAMBIA got their debut campaign in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) off to the best possible start as they got the better of Mauritania in a clash between two of the most inexperienced sides in the tournament. The Scorpions, as Gambia are affectionately known, defeated Mauritania 1-0 in their Group F opener played at the Limbe Omnisport Stadium last night. Ablie Jallow, who turns up for Seraing in the Belgian First Division A on loan from Ligue 1 club Metz, was the hero for Gambia as he scored their first ever goal in the tournament. And the 23-year-old’s early strike was enough to hand his side a dream start in their debut campaign as they bagged maximum points. The win was of paramount importance for Tom Saintfiet’s men who will only have it tougher in their remaining two matches of the group where they face the significantly superior pair of Mali and Tunisia. However, they have given themselves a big chance of potentially upsetting the apple cart and progressing to the next round at the expense of one of their more fancied opponents. Mauritania, on the other hand, are making an immediate return to the Afcon after crashing out in the group stages in Egypt three years ago, when they finished rock-bottom with two points from three games. And they will now need to do the unthinkable against Tunisia and Mali in their last two group matches to avoid suffering the same fate after their disappointing start to the campaign. They are currently on a woeful run that has seen them manage just two wins in their last 12 outings.
