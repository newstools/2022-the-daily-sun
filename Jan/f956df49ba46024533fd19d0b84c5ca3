THE Khuleni family from Marikana Squatter Camp in Saldanha, Cape Town, needs help to transport the body of Asemahle Khuleni (17) to Khayelitsha. Vuyokazi Yoli (44) said her niece, Asemahle died last month after poisoning herself. “She started feeling hot and we called an ambulance, but it never arrived and she died,” she said, adding that they didn’t know why she took her life. “We cannot bury her. We took her to a mortuary in Saldanha and asked the municipality to help us bury her as we didn’t have the means to take her to Eastern Cape, where we wished to bury her.” They said they found an undertaker who could take her body to the Eastern Cape if they found someone to fetch it from Saldanha and bring it to Khayelitsha. So, they are now pleading for help from SunReaders.
