POPULAR dancing trend #UmlandoChallenge has landed radio presenter and reality TV star Dineo Ranaka in big trouble. Dineo has allegedly been suspended by Metro FM after partaking in the challenge that saw her dancing on top of the furniture at the station. According to media reports, her suspension started on Monday, 17 January. Dineo hosts The Bridge on weekdays between 9am to 12pm. The show’s popularly known for its segment Ask A Man, where listeners call in for advice about their relationships. The challenge was started by musician Toss, with the aim of promoting his new single, Umlando with 9umba & Mdoovar featuring Mdoovar, Lady Du, Sino Msolo, Young Stunna, Slade and Sir Trill on social media. It ended up going viral with many South Africans, especially men, taking part.
