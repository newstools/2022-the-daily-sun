MARITZBURG United chairman, Farook Kadodia, says the partnership with German Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld will enable his club to attract, retain and develop some of the team’s best players in future. Yesterday, Maritzburg announced a partnership agreement with his coach Ernst Middendorp’s former club on a two-year deal, with a two-year option. The partnership will see both clubs exchange programmes from the development structures, and will also see The Team of Choice playing friendly matches against Arminia either in Germany or Mzansi. Arminia is a familiar club to South Africa. It is the club that Sibusiso Zuma, Delron Buckley, Siyabonga Nkosi and Ronwen Fernandez previously played for. They were promoted back to the top flight in the 2020-21 season. “We must also understand that the club need to grow to be self-sustainable,” said Kadodia, who in September signed another partnership with Gift of the Givers. Middendorp said development wise in South Africa there is a huge problem and that’s part of the reason is Bafana Bafana did not qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations finals that is underway in Cameroon. “At the end of the day we need qualified players, otherwise you cannot really produce a national team, which will be able to compete at the African Cup of Nations or World Cup,” revealed Middendorp, who said he had no part to play in this partnership despite having coached the club three times. The youth in this partnership is definitely the main part with one player who is 18 years old sent to the town of Bielefeld.”
