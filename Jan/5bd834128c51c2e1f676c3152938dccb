KAIZER Chiefs will today at 4pm appear before PSL prosecutor Zola Majavu, who have charged them on “non fulfilment of their fixtures” against Cape Town City and Golden Arrows in December last year. This is as a result of allegations that most of their players had tested positive for Covid-19. Chiefs, on 3 December, made a call to the league to postpone five of their fixtures for the month due to the number of positive Covid-19 test results. With delay to get response from the league, Amakhosi opted to a no-show on both matches, which raised questions about regulations passed late in 2020 that the pandemic will not be used reason to move matches by clubs. On 3 December, Chiefs released a statement emphasising their challenges of increased infections that has befallen the club, and the numbers kept increasing. Amakhosi have since vowed to challenge the league on this matter, which has been described as complicated by the league. However, Majavu, who just took over the prosecutor hot-seat at the PSL after Nande Becker’s sudden shock departure, confirmed last week that Chiefs will appear before their disciplinary committee today. The PSL is under pressure to act on Chiefs’ no-show, and the club run the risk of forfeiting match days’ points to City and Arrows, respectively. The league DC has the right to sanction them in that way as walk-over, as all 32 clubs on 10 December 2020 agreed that, before last season got underway: “Covid-19 positive results are not exceptional circumstances justifying the postponement of a match”. This letter was signed by PSL acting CEO Mato Madlala. This after it was raised in the Board of Governors’ meeting (BoG) on 31 July 2020. Cape Umoya were the first to suffer the consequence and lost valuable three points.
