SANGOMA hits the dance floor leaving Mzansi shocked. We live in interesting times indeed. These are the words of many who're questioning how this is
happening. We've seen sangomas perform miracles but we've never seen
them jaiving in parties or clubs. Even though a few say it's okay for him to do as he pleases
because it's his life, many believe that this is disrespectful to his ancestors
and should not be happening. Wadlal'umakhosi?? pic.twitter.com/XUq1msZXyE  "These days people will do anything for likes and
views, it's shocking. This is very disappointing and disrespectful to say the
least," said Lulu Shani on Twitter. Lindokuhle Fakude said he's not sure why this guy is jaiving
like this while he has his attire on but he wouldn't be able to still trust him
as a sangoma because he looks funny. "He doesn't respect his ancestors but he looks young
and I hope he'll find people who'll guide him on his journey. Magauta Mabeleng said one of her cousins used to do such
things and people around the neighborhood stopped taking her seriously. "When the family tried to guide her, she would throw
tantrums and tell us to mind our business, now she has zero clients because of
such," said Magauta. A sangoma, Themba Gamede said he doesn't know what this
man's ancestors allow and do not allow but he's never seen a sangoma doing such
and doesn't believe those old sangomas would do this.
