PHUMZILE Mlangeni has scored a big new gig. The actress, best known for playing Buyi Vilakazi on SABC1’s sitcom Family Bonds, will be joining the second season of Mzansi Magic drama series The Republic in the role of Nomzamo. Speaking to Daily Sun, Phumzile said she was overjoyed when she got a callback for the role. “I can’t even describe how happy I was when I received the callback, I was over the moon. I have loved the show since season one and being part of it is a dream come true. I can’t wait for people to see the magic we have created,” she said. Phumzile described her character, who is a diabetic, as simple and down to earth. “People are going to love her because they will see themselves in her. Her actions mirror the love of a mother who will stop at nothing to see her children succeed, even when she is on her death bed,” she said.

The role did not challenge me at all, except for the fact that I am a bubbly person and I couldn’t be as lively as I normally am because she is sick.” Phumzile, who has appeared in popular shows such as Generations, Isidingo and Isthembiso, said it was an important storyline as it would teach people about diabetes. Phumzile, who also joined the cast of Skeem Saam recently, said she was proud of how far she had come in her career. “It’s not easy to continuously land roles and this can only be God’s grace. I am thankful to him and I’m planning to take up more space this year. Hopefully, I will go back to comedy as it is how I got into the industry initially.”
