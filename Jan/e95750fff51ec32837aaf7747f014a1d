FORMER Orlando Pirates winger Sameehg Doutie has announced his retirement from football on his social media. In a long statement, Doutie, who had a nomadic career, thanked all the players, coaches and physios who helped him achieve trophies wherever he went. The 32-year-old has been without a club since Bidvest Wits’ 99 history came to a shuddering end at the end of 2019-20 season, after arriving from Swedish side IFK Varnamo at the beginning of that term. Doutie made his PSL debut on 15 August 2007 for Ajax Cape Town (now Cape Town Spurs) against Bloemfontein Celtic under Craig Rosslee as an 18-year-old. His last game in the PSL was in September 2020 against Polokwane City at FNB Stadium. Doutie claimed the Telkom Knockout in his second season with the Urban Warriors when the Mother City club beat Pirates in the final in Durban’s Chatsworth Stadium. “As I embark (on the new journey), I’ll leave you with these beautiful memories,” he said. He counted clubs, having started his football journey at Ajax and Pirates, then went to SuperSport United, and Wits (in his first stint in 2014-15), Atletico Kolkata in India, Ajax in his second stint ( in 2016-17), Jamshedpur FC also in India. On top of TKO with Ajax, he won the MTN8 and another TKO in his first season in the 2011-12 with Pirates, Nedbank Cup with SuperSport in the second half of that season. In India, he claimed the India Super League in 2016. Doutie was part of the exciting young South Africa side in the 2009 Fifa Under-20 World Cup in Egypt under Serame Letsoaka that had the likes of Andile Jali, Thulani Hlatshwayo, Phumelele Bhengu, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Thulani Serero, George Maluleka, Kamohelo Mokotjo, Kermit Erasmus, Darren Keet, Dylan Claasen and Mandla Masango. They lost to tournament eventual winners Ghana in the quarter-final.
