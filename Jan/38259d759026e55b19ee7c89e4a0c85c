Dear MizzB MY boyfriend and I are both 28 years old. I have two kids and he doesn’t have any. He doesn’t support me when it comes to my kids’ needs and it stresses me. How do I continue with a man who doesn’t treat my kids like they are his? Dear Sista A relationship is between two people and should not include your kids. Your boyfriend can decide whether he wants to actively be involved in providing for your kids or not. It seems you want to see if he loves you by how he spends his money on your kids and that is unfair. A person can still love you without carrying your financial baggage. Ask yourself if you want a partner to love you or to provide for you and your kids. Good luck!
