ZULU King Misuzulu kaZwelithini Zulu has finally broken his silence about the dispute over his throne. Speaking at the commemoration of the Battle of Isandlwana on Saturday, 22 January, the king said he wanted the dispute resolved as soon as possible as it not only hurt him, but also his nation’s spiritual well-being. He said if the Western-style coronation did not happen, the traditional version had to as it was more urgent. He addressed the matter after an interdict to try and stop him from speaking at the commemoration was dismissed. On Saturday, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed the interdict brought by members of the royal house who opposed him, arguing he could not speak as he was not officially the king. “I have a wish that the dispute be resolved as soon as possible because there is a minority that is opposing us, giving us a hard time and taking us up and down in court.” The king thanked amabutho leaders and amakhosi by building a kraal to be used for his coronation at KwaKhangelamankengane Palace. He said: “I am lucky because my traditional prime minister has inspected the kraal and given it his blessings. We’re lucky because we still have a living ancestor in Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. I also thank the Shembe Church because they contributed to the building of the kraal. I thank Unyazilwezulu because he blessed the kraal.”
