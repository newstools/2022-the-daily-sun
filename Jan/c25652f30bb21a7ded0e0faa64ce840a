SOUTH Africa fast bowler Duanne Olivier has made a strong return to the Test team. The 29-year-old made his presence felt in the first innings of the second Test against India at the Wanderers, where he took three wickets in his 17 overs. Olivier, along with youngster Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada, tore through the Indian batting order to give the Proteas an advantage. It is Olivier’s first Test match in three years, with his last appearance for South Africa coming back in 2019 against Sri Lanka in Gqeberha. And speaking at the close of play on the opening day, Olivier described his return as having felt like a new debut. “I think it felt like a new debut if you can say that. I was very nervous,” said the 29-year-old. “But for me, it’s all about trying to have good energy with the ball, try and put the team in the best possible position and make life easier for our batters. I know you are not always going to get it right but as a person, I always strive to be better.” Olivier appeared to have lost a bit of pace, but certainly none of his effectiveness as he bagged three wickets to go past 50 Test wickets for the Proteas. The pacer admitted that he wasn’t satisfied with his showing, but believes that he will only get better as the match progresses. “I didn’t get it right at times,” admitted Olivier. “Sometimes it was a bit ‘floaty’ and that’s okay, as a person you try to improve. I’ll do a bit of reflection. “I’m still trying to bowl fuller, at a good pace. There’s the second innings to come and hopefully there’ll be some improvement.” The Proteas are hoping to level the series at one-all, having lost the first Test match at Centurion last week.
