POLICE are offering a reward of up to R50 000 for finding eight-year-old Tlotso Mogomotsi Moilwe. Tlotso from Mogwase in North West was last seen on Christmas Day. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said the reward would be handed over to anyone who knows where Tlotso is and has information, which could lead to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the boy’s disappearance. She said Tlotso was playing with his friends in Segakwaneng Village, outside Rustenburg, when he disappeared. “At the time of his disappearance, he was wearing camouflage shorts with a black T-shirt and grey slippers,” she said. Myburgh said initial police investigations led to the arrest of a 28-year-old suspect, who appeared in the Mogwase Magistrates Court on Thursday, 6 January on a charge of kidnapping. The suspect would remain behind bars until her next appearance on Thursday, 13 January. She asked anyone with information to contact Sergeant Vincent Mzinyathi on 082 416 3197 or call the SAPS CrimeStop number on 08600 10111. Anonymous tip-offs can also be sent via the My SAPS app. “The police search and rescue teams have without success been searching for Tlotso since his disappearance,” said Myburgh. When asked why the police were offering a reward, she said: “Each case has its own merit and police issued a reward because of the uniqueness of the case.” Meanwhile, North West police commissioner Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena requested that the public help in the search for the missing child.
