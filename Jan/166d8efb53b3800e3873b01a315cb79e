MAMELODI Sundowns defender Malebogo "Bale" Modise is satisfied with how his career is shaping. The 22-year-old was promoted to Sundowns’ first team in July 2020 after spending six years within the development ranks. However, he is yet to win his place in the first team. Last season Sundowns loaned him out to Maritzburg United to get game time. In a one year stint with the Team of Choice, the versatile player impressed and was called back to re-join Downs. But Modise was shipped out again on loan to JDR Stars at the start of the current season. So far at JDR, he has done exceptionally well with the Hammer Boys, scoring five goals and providing numerous assists in 16 league games. Talking to SunSport, Modise, who can also play as a midfielder and as winger, said there is always room for improvement for him. "Personally, I am happy with where I am with my career," Modise said. "I believe God's timing is the best. I still need to work hard, put more effort in my craft." Modise represented South Africa at all junior levels, Under-17 and Under-20 team and has been to three junior Fifa World Cup. He says his goal now is to win promotion with JDR Stars. JDR are second in the GladAfrica Championship with 32 points, same as leaders Richards Bay FC. The two teams are separated by goal difference. He added: "Firstly, I would like to thank the chairman of the team and his technical team for believing in me and giving me the opportunity. “It has been a difficult first round for us because we were not consistent with our performances, but it was not too bad . “I think we achieved our target for the first round. Inconsistency has been our challenge but we will improve and chase our goal. “Our target is to win promotion, but it's not going to be easy . I think we will have to work hard as a team and fight for each other for the remaining 13 games." The Championship second round will resume on 19 February.
