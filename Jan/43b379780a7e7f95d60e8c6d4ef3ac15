FORMER Free State Stars coach Tom Saintfiet hopes to lead the small Gambia national team into the knockout stages of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in the country’s first appearance at the continental showpiece. Gambia, one of the lowest ranked sides in the Afcon finals, qualified for the biennial tournament in Cameroon for the first time in their history last March. The Scorpions, as they are known, are in Group F and will face the Eagles of Mali, Mauritania and 2004 champions Tunisia. They kick off their campaign against Mauritania at Stade De Limbe on Wednesday (6pm). As Afcon novices, they have not had the best preparation, with positive Covid-19 cases messing up the team’s camp when they went to Qatar for warm-up matches and warm weather to help them acclimatise with Cameroon’s climate. But things did not go according to plan due to Covid. Their planned friendly matches against Comoros, Afcon defending champions Algeria and Syria, were cancelled at the last minute due to the pandemic. However, Saintfiet, who was in charge of just 10 matches for Ea Lla Koto after he was appointed at the beginning of 2014-15 season, told Cafonline his side cannot be taken for granted. “It’s not an easy group, but it might not be the hardest. Tunisia and Mali are favourites and Mauritania has a good team,” said the nomadic Belgian coach. “It’s not impossible for Gambia. We are going to play (use) our chances to the maximum. My team has proven in recent years that they are competitive.” True to Saintfiet’s assessment, Gambia finished top of their group in the qualifiers ahead of Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. For Gambia, in the dugout, there will be another familiar face from South Africa. Mamelodi Sundowns fitness and conditioning coach Riedoh Berdien from Cape Town is also the Gambia national team fitness coach and has worked with Saintfiet for many years having first met at Stars in 2014.
