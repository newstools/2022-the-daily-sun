MEDIA personality Katlego Maboe’s two-year legal battle is finally over. The talented former presenter of SABC3 morning show Expresso was accused of abusing his former partner Monique Muller, whom he’d cheated on and gave her an STD. In a statement on Instagram the shamed media personality announced the court has ruled in his favour. He said it ruled that Monique, who got a protection order against him, had no grounds to do so and also ruled there were no finds of the acts of domestic violence allegedly perpetuated against her and the matter has been dismissed. The protection order against Katlego was obtained in September, weeks before the video of him confessing to cheating on his wife went viral.

I may never know or understand the real motive behind all of this destruction and heartache, but right now I just want to focus on putting the pieces of his life together,” he said. Katlego, who has been out of the limelight since the incident that went viral on social media, has suffered serious reputational damage that resulted in a loss of his professional livelihood and has not been able to recover the financial loss ever since. His statement also said he was going to take legal action against various people and organisations, such as the SAFTAs and Women for Change founder Sabrina Walter.
