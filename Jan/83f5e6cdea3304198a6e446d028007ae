THE family of the
brutally murdered Sam Mbatha said they will finally get closure after DNA
results confirmed that the body found inside a burnt Hyundai i20 in a soccer
field in Ikageng section, Klipgat was indeed his. The 24-year-old
socialite, who was from the LGBTQI+ community, was found burnt after he went
missing in June last year. Police spokeswoman
Colonel Adele Myburgh said Sam’s body was found after investigations led the
cops to a house in Phutha section, also in Klipgat on Monday, 21 June. The house was searched
and in one of the bedrooms, the police found blood stains on the floor, under
and on top of a bed, as well as on the carpet. She said that an axe,
suspected to have been used during the commission of this crime, was found on
top of the roof of the house. “After this gruesome
discovery, investigations led to the tracing and arrest of four suspects,
namely Arthur Khoza (19), Thato Masetla (22), Junior Modise (21) and Mahlatsi
Nkuna (21),” said Myburgh. Family spokesman
Kgomotso Sepeng confirmed the family has received the DNA results and that they
will now proceed and make arrangements to lay Sam to rest. “We would like to
appreciate every person who showed us support and distributed posts regarding
Sam. Friends, colleagues, organisations, media houses who took interest in
sharing our story and the police who 
helped us during our time of pain,” said Kgomotso. “We will communicate
the details of the memorial and funeral arrangements in due course,” he said. All four accused will
appear in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 18 January on a charge
of murder.
