 ISRAELI police and special units invaded the Salhiya family home at 3am in Sheikh Jarrah on Wednesday, 19 January. According to a family spokesman, militarised cops attacked the sleeping occupants, including women and children, detaining 18 family members. Two hours later, Israeli bulldozers arrived and demolished the home. The day before, Israeli forces erected barriers around the house to fence in the occupants. The father of the house, Mahmoud Salhiya, had been engaged in resistance to the forced eviction. But according to his daughter, he had taken a rest after two days of being awake, and that’s when police struck. Israel claims the area has been designated for the building of a school. – REUTERS
