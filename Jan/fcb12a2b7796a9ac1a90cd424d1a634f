Mzansi’s favourite reality TV show Big Brother Mzansi (BBM) is coming back and viewers are excited. The show that last aired in 2015 will be hosted by actor and TV presenter, Lawrence Maleka. It is returning this Sunday, 23 January on Mzansi Magic. Social media has been buzzing since the announcement of the return of BBM and people can’t wait to tune in. Lawrence spoke to SunBuzz about the show and what it’s about. “Big Brother is a social format where we take a group of strangers with a different outlook on things, and put them under one roof. All this happens for a certain amount of days and we see how they stay with one another and how they cope with being in each others space. They do this in the hopes of winning R2 million,” he said. The actor who stars on 1Magic’s The River said the format of the show is the same as the previous seasons, but there are some differences.

What makes it different is the people who come in as contestants. “There’s a bit of everyone in the house – young and old, introverts and extroverts, people who are trying to find themselves and more. This year, the major changes are the production house. It’s no longer the same one that produced previous seasons, the host, and the contestants,” said the presenter. Lawrence said he can’t reveal a lot of things about the new season, but hopes people will tune in. “I can’t say anything about the segments and twists that’ll happen in the show. “I also can’t say how many contestants there will be, that’s one of the surprises. But I can say that, it will run for about three months,” he said.
