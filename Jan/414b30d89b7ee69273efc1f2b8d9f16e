A Marite gang leader in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, will spend the rest of his life behind bars for the crimes he committed since 2019. Vusi Sihlabale (41), who led the Ellesse gang for years, was convicted on Tuesday, 11 January, after fatally shooting Patrick Mhlanga (41). The Mpumalanga Division of the High Court sitting in Graskop heard how Sihlabela, Karabo Makhubedu (31) and Norman Mokoena (25) entered a local tavern in 2019 and randomly targeted as well as robbed Mhlanga of his wallet. When they heard the following day that he had reported the incident to the police, they hunted him down, found him at his house, and then shot and killed him. They also shot and injured his nephew in the process. Police then launched an investigation into the matter and managed to trace and arrest Sihlabela in August 2019. Makhubedu and Mokoena were arrested in 2020. Sihlabela was also sentenced to 75 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm as well as unlawful possession of ammunition. Meanwhile, Makhubedu was handed life imprisonment for murder and a combined 65 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm as well as unlawful possession of ammunition. Mokoena was also given a life sentence and a combined 65 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm as well as unlawful possession of ammunition. Residents of the area said this was a big relief for the community. They told Daily Sun there would be peace in the area. “We will now live freely. We wish that they don’t even get any parole and die there,” said one community member. Meanwhile, Mpumalanga police boss, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela applauded the detectives for their hard work thorough their investigations which led to the convictions.
