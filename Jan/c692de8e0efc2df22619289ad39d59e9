 ENELOPE Mhaleni has had sleepless nights since a scammer made a fake Facebook account in her name and started asking her friends and family for money and airtime. The 31-year-old manager at an electronics store in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, discovered this in December. She received angry phone calls from friends asking what was going on. Others called to check if she had received the cash. “I have never asked my Facebook friends for cash or airtime. I work and I’m satisfied with the salary I am getting as a manager,” she said. “I’m not sleeping as this scammer is making my life a living hell. My siblings and I called the number she put on the fake account and she answered. She asked if we’d sent her airtime or money and said she needed it immediately.” When asked why she was doing it, the scammer apparently said she wanted to drag her name through the mud, so people would kill her. Penelope said: “I am no longer safe. I have laid charges with the police and I believe they will bring her to book.” She has received over 60 messages from people in relationships, saying she’d sent them romantic texts and tricked them into giving her money. When the SunTeam phoned the scammer, she immediately asked if money or an airtime voucher had been sent to her. “When asked for a bank account to send the money to, she quickly hung up and switched off both her phones. Captain S’fiso Nyakane said the matter was being investigated.
