NIGERIA have signaled their intentions early in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) currently ongoing in Cameroon. The Super Eagles sent out a stern message to the rest of their competitors with an entertaining 1-0 win over fellow tournament favorites Egypt at the Estadio Roumde Adjia in Garoua yesterday. Leicester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho scored the solitary goal in the Group D encounter dubbed “the clash of the titans.” The two African powerhouses are expected to challenge for the title and their meeting was meant to serve as a barometer to measure their readiness to conquer the continent again. Nigeria, the three-time Afcon champions who last lifted the trophy in 2013, seem eager to return to the pinnacle of African football and reclaim their glory. And they made their intentions clear with a fast start, putting the Pharaohs on the backfoot early in the match. But they had to wait until the half-hour mark to take the lead as former Manchester City striker Iheanacho blasted them in front with a powerful shot just inside the box. The Pharaohs, who had been content with soaking pressure, were forced to come out of their shell and try to get back into the game. However, their efforts proved futile as they couldn’t claw their way back, even with one of the best players in the world in Mohamed Salah. Carlos Queiroz's men, who are making a record-extending 23rd Afcon appearance and are the tournament’s most successful team with seven titles, will look to bounce back against Guinea-Bissau in their next match on Saturday. The Super Eagles next face Sudan on the same day.
