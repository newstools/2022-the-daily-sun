FORMER Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang remains an outcast at the club and has been left out of the traveling Arsenal squad for their training camp in Dubai as reported by Sky Sports News. The Gabon international fell out of favour with his manager, Mikel Arteta following another disciplinary breach last month which saw him stripped of the captaincy. The forward has not played for the club since December since when they lost 2-1 away to Everton. He has been isolated from the squad since then and he has been training alone for several weeks. Earlier this week, former Arsenal star Emmanuel Adebayor told Sky Sports  Arsenal did now know how to forgive and that he doubts that Aubameyang will ever play for Arsenal again. “I know he’s going to go through a lot because that’s Arsenal for you, you can do whatever you do. They never learned or knew how to forgive so I knew he would go through a lot,” he said. He added that Aubameyang is a strong and fantastic player and he sent him a message wishing him all the best in trying to bounce back. Adebayor said it would be a surprise if Aubameyang was afforded a way back to the team because he suffered a similar fate at the club. “We want him to bounce back because whether we like it or not, he is our African brother and we want him to keep representing Africa the way he was doing before the problem,” he said.
