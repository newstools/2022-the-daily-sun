STELLENBOSCH FC coach Steve Barker is expecting big things from his newest recruit, Venezuelan forward Juan Ortiz. Barker’s Stellies utilised their extensive scouting network to identify Ortiz, a player he is convinced will take the Premier Soccer League (PSL) by storm. Ortiz caught Barker’s eye after he had an impressive season in the top flight in his homeland, where he scored 16 goals in 32 appearances for Monagas. Barker is aware that the exciting attacking midfielder could need a bit of time to adapt to life in Mzansi and the PSL. However, Barker has little doubt that once his new signing settles into his new surroundings in the Cape Winelands, Ortiz will prove to be another excellent recruit. He isn’t the first South American to join Stellies with Argentine Junior Mendieta showing his quality in Mzansi’s top flight. “He (Ortiz) is an exciting prospect, I have seen him in training,” said Barker. “He was one of the top goal scorers in his previous team. “He is a goalscorer, and he brings a different dimension to our attack. “He has great movement, great anticipation and is great in the air as well. He is strong with both feet and has the ability to take on players. “But there’s always that adaptation period in South African football, we tried hard to get him in January, but we know that the real impact will come next season. “We are still convinced that he will have a big impact in what is left of the season as well.” Barker’s Stellies have punched well above their weight in the DStv Premiership this season, currently sitting third in the standings. This has been a massive improvement from last season where they escaped relegation by the skin of their teeth. Barker, however, insists that his side didn’t perform poorly last season despite their underwhelming position on the log. “I think last season we just lacked that bit of luck here and there,” added Barker. “Our performances were not too bad.”
