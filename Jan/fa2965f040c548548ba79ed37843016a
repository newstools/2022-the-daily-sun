A GRAVEYARD is a place for the dead but this one looks like a bustling community of the living. From a distance, you can see houses that have been built in the cemetery in Mountain View in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. However, when you take a closer look, it becomes clear the houses are actually stylish tombstones. The SunTeam recently visited the graveyard and counted 10 graves that were styled this way. Resident Besana Mahlangu (48) said rich families in the area were in competition to give their dead loved ones luxury resting places. “Erecting a tombstone helps future generations easily recognise a grave. It’s not cheap but our graveyard is fast becoming a suburb for the dead. At a distance, you would swear they were houses,” she said. ALSO READ: ANACONDA THAT WAS ON THE LOOSE HAS BEEN FOUND! Mumsy Mahlangu (44) told Daily Sun competition among the dead was becoming the same as among the living. “The gap between the living is being taken to the grave sites now. People feel pressured to do the same for their dead loved ones but it’s not necessary,” she said. Themba Zondi (61) said she didn’t see anything wrong with showing the dead they were still loved. Papi Mhlongo (58) said: “By erecting such stylish tombstones they show love and are honouring those who have passed on.” Sangoma Mehlwemamba Sikhosana said there was nothing wrong with doing good things for your ancestors. “If their money allows them, let them do it,” he said.
