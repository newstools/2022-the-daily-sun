AVANZA taxi drivers in Nyanga, Cape Town are happy that schools have reopened. Sinethemba Ngalo (39) said before the schools opened, they were struggling to make even R100 before 8am. “Now it’s 8am and I’ve already made R300,” he said. “It’s all because schools are opened and we have been transporting pupils.” He said that some drivers made more than what he did. “Our wish is for pupils to go to school every day, but they were divided into groups because of Covid-19. That also killed a lot of transport staff. But we’re hopeful things will go back to normal soon,” said Sinethemba.  Another driver said they were excited about the reopening of schools. “You’d swear we are the ones going to school. We’re happy because we are going to make money, something we haven’t been doing for a long time,” said the driver. However, resident Fikiswa Mlandu (35) said drivers needed to treat them with respect. “I’m happy they are going to make money, but they need to respect us. They need us and we need them to transport our kids to school,” said Fikiswa.
