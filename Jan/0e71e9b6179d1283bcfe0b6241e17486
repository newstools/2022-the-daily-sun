THE Volkswagen Polo has been hot property since the day it launched in Mzansi. However, these days it seems the xenon headlights are more sought-after than the actual car. In recent years Mzansi Polo owners couldn’t park their cars in peace, as they feared headlights gang. Instead of stealing the whole car, the headlights gang only goes for two things – the headlights. In a video that has gone viral on social media, a white VW Polo can be seen parked on the side of the road as a white KIA Rio comes into the picture and parks next to the Polo. Following that, two men are seen getting out of the car and running towards the front of the Polo when they start fiddling with the headlights. In less than 60 seconds the two men were done taking the headlights out. They jumped into the Rio and fled.
