KAIZER Chiefs reserve team coach, Vela Khumalo, has confirmed to SunSport that young sensation, Mfundo “Obrigado” Vilakazi will be part of Amakhosi’s Diski Challenge team in the second round of the competition. The 15-year-old won the hearts of many football fans at the 30th edition of the Phillys Games, which ended early this month. Vilakazi was part of the young Doornkop Students FC squad that was knocked out in the semi-finals of the tournament by 18 Mambas, who eventually lost in the final. Despite Doornkop not winning the tournament, Vilakazi was one of the players who made a name for himself in the competition scoring some crucial goals on their way to the last four. The Chiefs Under-17 player became a social media sensation with his Kasi flavour and flair, which also gained him a huge following. Chiefs Diski coach Khumalo said he saw a glimpse of him during the festive games, and he was impressed. Khumalo revealed that Vilakazi would get a fair chance in the Diski Challenge, which resumed the past weekend following the December break. “There will be players who will be given a chance in the Diski Challenge in this round. Mfundo (Vilakazi) is one of those players,” Khumalo told SunSport before their match against Royal AM last weekend. “I can see social media people are all over us. They want to see him playing. But we need to manage him well. He is one for the future. We are going to give him minutes.” Besides his tricky skills, which we hardly see in the professional ranks, Vilakazi displayed maturity beyond his age which saw him getting praise from veterans such as Chiefs legend Reneilwe Letsholonyane, who recently retired from playing and Marumo Gallants winger Joseph Malongoane. The past weekend when Chiefs lost 5-4 to Royal AM, Vilakazi was not part of the team as he did not train. He was rested following his tight schedule during festive games.
