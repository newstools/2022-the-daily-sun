RESIDENTS gathered on Friday, 14 January to pray for an end to GBV and crime. Organiser Steven Sekoila told Daily Sun he wanted the people of Naledi, Soweto, to start the year with a clean slate and a new vision. “We’re doing as we please and not inviting God into things we do. That’s why everything is going south. We need to become one again and deal with the challenges in our community head-on. “People can’t even ask for help from neighbours because of pride and some are even unapproachable.” Steven said there will be more prayer sessions and he would invite NGOs that dealt with GBV. “We also want women to start opening up so they can get help.” He thanked community leader Peter Rataemane for helping organise the event. Peter said while the event was taking place, a shocking incident happened. “A woman in our area was raped by her brother. We need to end this in our community.” Counsellor Orapeleng Mmota said the event will help residents and contribute to decreasing crime. “I’m happy with the number of people who attended. “Correctional services, the SAPS and the CPF also attended. This is a great sign that we’re moving forward.”
