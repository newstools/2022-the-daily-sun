 Six people have been killed, including four children, while two others were injured when a bakkie and truck collided on the N1 south in Mokopane on Friday. The incident happened approximately 55 kilometres outside Polokwane. When paramedics arrived at 12:15, they found a bakkie in the one lane, while a truck-and-trailer was found on its roof on the side of the road, said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring.    Meiring said two other men, believed to be in their 50s, were trapped inside the truck in a critical condition. He added that provincial fire services had to use specialised equipment to free the men from the vehicle. Once they were released, the men were treated and provided with advanced life support interventions before they were transported to Voortrekker Hospital for urgent care, he said.
