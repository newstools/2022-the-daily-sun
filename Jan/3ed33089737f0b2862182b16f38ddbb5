BELGIUM giants R.S.C Anderlecht, coached by Manchester City legend Vincent Kompany, have tabled an offer for SuperSport United star midfielder Teboho Mokoena. At the same time, DStv Premiership log leaders and SuperSport’s cross town rivals Mamelodi Sundowns have also tabled an offer for the Bafana Bafana star. Sundowns though have an edge in this deal as they are believed to have tabled a R25 million offer while Belgium side has offered R20 million. However, while Anderlecht might have been disadvantaged because of the fee, Mokoena is in favour of going abroad instead of joining Sundowns our sources say. Mokoena’s viewpoint is that Sundowns have so many players in the midfield, which he feels he won’t get much game time hence he prefers to go to Belgium. In this case, SuperSport have no pressure to cash in as Mokoena is on a long-term contract with SuperSport. But the club, preferably, wants Mokoena to join a club abroad unlike their rivals, which is the club’s wish.
