A DESPERATE family is
pleading with the community to help share some light into Matshepo Malefane’s
death. Family and friends
gathered to bid farewell to Matshepo after her body was found hanging from the
tree. The 19-year-old
student was found last Wednesday, 5 January in the bushes not far from her home
in Mapetla, Soweto. The shocking discovery
was made by residents who alerted Matshepo’s family. This was after she
didn’t return home for the past two days. Her family said she went to her
boyfriend’s place without informing them.  They believe Matshepo
wouldn’t have committed suicide because she had big dreams and although she was
hanging from the tree, her feet were on the rock and the back of her clothes
was dirty. Her death has since
sent shock wave through the community and social media. Matshepo was described
as a bubbly person with big dreams in the medical field.  Matshepo’s uncle Abe
Motaung said: “I speak on behalf of the family. We are deeply heartbroken about
what happened to Matshepo. We plead with anyone who might have seen what happen
to tell us. If it’s difficult to do so, they can write a letter and leave it at
the gate. We will appreciate that and take it from there. “At the moment we are
in the dark as to what happened to our child to have been found in this manner.
Someone must have seen something and we ask wholeheartedly for help,” said Abe. According to a close
friend to the family, days leading up to Matshepo’s death, she repeatedly told
her mum that she loved her, which was unusual.  Matshepo’s friend
Keletso Lenong said: “In the recent months, Matshepo asked which song I’ll
remember her with when she dies. It was a very strange question but today it
makes sense. “She had big dreams
and wanted more in life. She used to say she will do everything in her power to
succeed and she loved her family.” Police said an inquest
docket was opened and under investigation.
