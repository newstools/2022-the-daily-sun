MUZIKAYISE Malephane maintains that he was hired by Ntuthuko Shoba to take Tshegofatso Pule’s life. Malephane, who is serving a 20-year sentence for the murder, testified in the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg on Tuesday, 25 January. He confirmed he met Shoba when they were in high school. He said they had not been in contact for a while when Shoba called him. “I don’t know where he got my number but he told me he had a task for me to carry out. I then sent him my location and he came to my girlfriend’s house,” he said. Tracker reports indicate Shoba did indeed visit the witness. “Shoba asked me to find someone who would get rid of Pule. Instead of finding someone, I decided to take the job myself,” he said. Malephane said he was driven by greed and selfishness.  “Initially, Shoba wanted to pay me R7 000 but I refused and he increased the fee to R20 000 and eventually R70 000,” he said. Malephane said Pule was supposed to die on 29 May 2020 but it didn’t happen. On 4 June, there was a second attempt and she was killed. Pule’s cousin Palesa Senokoane also took to the stand and confirmed the last time she spoke to her was on 4 June. She said Pule, who was pregnant, called her on WhatsApp to say she was with Shoba making a list of baby clothes. “I told her not to buy a lot of clothes for the child and then asked her to greet Shoba as I could hear him speak in the background,” she said. The trial continues on Wednesday, 26 January.
