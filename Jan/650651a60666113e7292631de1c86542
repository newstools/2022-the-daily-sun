Singer-songwriter Vuyo Mbita’s journey into the music industry hasn’t been easy and he tells it all on his new single, Emaweni. The 31-year-old musician, who calls himself the New Age Superstar, said the single, which was released last year, is about all his struggles. Vuyo, who was born and raised in Ncora, Eastern Cape but is based in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, spoke to SunBuzz about his journey. “Emaweni is a single which describes my struggles in and outside of the music world. The song motivates people who are trying to make a living for themselves or make something of their dreams and follow them. “I want people to never give up. It is a beautiful African song that has great vocals and modern sounds with a lot of energy,” said Vuyo.

I took after my late grandmother who was most known for being an entertainer in almost all occasions held in the villages around us. “I then started listening to the likes of Brenda Fassie, Ringo and Ishmael, who I looked up to. I wanted everything that they had achieved in the music industry, and I’ve been pushing myself since,” he said. He said he’s working on a new album that he hopes to release this year. “Before releasing the album, I want to start with a music video for Emaweni. We’re planning to shoot it soon. Then, I’ll start working on the album. There are potentially big collaborations coming before the album drops. So, some exciting things are on the way.”
