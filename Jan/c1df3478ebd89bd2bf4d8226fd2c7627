Two girls were spotted going into an apartment accompanied by a man. But the guy who saw them didn’t think the girls may become human trafficking victims. He only realised they were in danger when he saw their photos that were posted by their families on Facebook. He contacted the family. The family then informed the police who rushed to the flat in the Springs CBD. Fortunately they arrived in time and found the girls, aged 14 and 17, locked in a room. The man who had locked them up was not there. “The girls told us he was coming to fetch them but they didn’t know where he was taking them,” said Captain Johannes Ramphora. Ramphora said the girls were taken to hospital for medical checkups and later taken to a place of safety. “We are still looking for the suspect who we are told is from Zimbabwe.” The mum of the girls said she sent them to do errands for her in Springs. “I became worried when they took long and it was getting late,” she said. “Their phones were off which made me suspicious.” She said she informed her relatives and one of them posted their photos on Facebook. Someone believed to be a tenant let them know that he had seen the girls walking into the building the previous day. “We went to the police station and thankfully they reacted quickly and found the girls,” said the mum. Cops are looking for the suspect.
