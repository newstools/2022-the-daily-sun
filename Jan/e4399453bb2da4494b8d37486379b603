INNOCENT Mathonsi believes the advice he received from former top achievers helped him perform exceptionally well. The 18-year-old, who matriculated from DD Mabuza Comprehensive High School in Nkomazi, Mpumalanga, obtained seven distinctions. He was one of the 33 national top achievers who were invited to breakfast by Education Minister Angie Motshekga on Thursday, 20 January. He said previous top achievers at his school advised them on how to master their study methods, which helped him to start preparing as early as January. “I used to sleep late going through previous question papers. I was doing self-study because I understood better when I was alone. I feel happy that the hard work and energy I invested is paying off.” Innocent has applied at several universities with the hopes of studying mechanical engineering. This is not the first time the school produced top achievers. Last year, four pupils were awarded fully-funded bursaries by the Department of Basic Education. Principal Mbongeni Ngomane said the school governing body and circuit played a vital role in supporting pupils. “We are happy to continue producing the best pupils. This raises the school’s flag high,” he said. Meanwhile, many matriculants received their results on Thursday, 21 January. While some will be smiling, others will be sad as they have not made it. The South African Anxiety and Depression Group (Sadag) advised pupils who failed not to give up. “We often receive calls from pupils who feel alone, like they can’t speak to parents or that no one understands what they are going through,” said Sadag’s Vanishaa Gordhan. “Parents can offer comfort and reassurance to matriculants – that it’s normal to feel disappointment and sadness about their results.” Pupils can contact Sadag on 0800 567 567 or www.sadag.org for more information.
