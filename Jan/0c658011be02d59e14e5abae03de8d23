SOUTH Africa skipper Dean Elgar has admitted that he was “pretty shocked” by teammate Quinton De Kock’s decision to retire from Test cricket. De Kock, who has been at the centre of controversy in recent months, decided to call time on his Test career after just 54 matches. The 29-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman said he wanted to give more time to his family while announcing his retirement. And while his skipper Elgar was caught off guard by the sudden decision to retire, he insists that life needs to go on without the talented left-handed batsman. “I was pretty shocked,” Elgar told the media. “I wasn’t aware this was going to happen. But sitting down with Quiney (Quinton de Kock), he explained his reasons and I respect and fully understand his decision,” “Hopefully he doesn’t wish one day that he was still part of our red-ball set-up. We have to get over it and move on. “I’ve been fortunate enough to experience quite a few big South African cricketers retire. One thing I’ve realized is that the game of cricket continues. You’re not immortal and the game definitely doesn’t stop for you. “It’s a tough one, but retirements are part and parcel of the game. Not having ‘Quinnie’ around is disappointing for me. But it’s something I need to get over, because I know there are a lot of talented players within our squad and our system that I need to give a lot of attention to now.” Elgar was speaking ahead of the second Test match against India, which takes place at the Wanderers Stadium starting today. The Proteas will be looking to bounce back from their 113-run loss to the tourists in the first Test played in Centurion last week. Elgar insists that De Kock retirement will not disturb the team in any way with Kyle Verreynne ready to step in and make the vacant position his own.
