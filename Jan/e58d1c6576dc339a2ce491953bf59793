Provincial SAPS spokeswoman Brigadier Brenda Muridili told Daily Sun the inmates escaped while en route to court in Vosloorus. “According to reports, the police truck transporting the prisoners was ambushed by three armed men driving a silver Audi vehicle at the corner of Barry Marais and Rondebult streets,” said Muridili. She said five of the six escapees were due in court for a Dawn Park case of business robbery, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms and the sixth escapee was due for his first appearance in a shoplifting case. Five escapees are named Nkululeko Nkomo, Robert Hlatshwayo, Thulani Dube, Augustine Moyo, Mbongiseni Mkandla, she said.
