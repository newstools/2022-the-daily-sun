SIX suspects were arrested in the Free State on Sunday, 23 January for theft, possession of presumed stolen property and fraud. Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said the group of men arrived at a petrol station in Dewetsdorp in a black Volkswagen microbus at about 18.30pm. “The bank card declined as they were making a payment for fuel and they fled the scene. The police were called to the scene and on arrival, initiated a preliminary investigation.” He said information led the cops to Riverside, where the vehicle was found abandoned and the police went searching for the suspects on foot. “Further information revealed a case of fraud was opened at Navalsig Police Station. “An advertisement to sell the microbus was placed on social media networks by a seller living in Estoire. One of the suspects showed interest and arrived there, where he made the transaction to purchase the vehicle.” Covane said the unsuspecting seller handed over the documents and the kombi. “After the suspect had left with the vehicle, the seller noticed the transaction was cancelled. A case of fraud was then opened on Friday, 21 January.” All six suspects, aged between 23 and 45, will appear in the Dewetsdorp Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 25 January.
