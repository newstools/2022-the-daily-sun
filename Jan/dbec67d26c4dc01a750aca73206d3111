Cops bust 14 suspects, aged between 19 and 58, for illegal mining on Wednesday 19 January. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the arrests were made thanks to an intelligence-driven operation by the public order police, visible policing, the detective service, crime intelligence, the mineral resources department and Anglo American’s security officers. “The team conducted an operation at Schoongezicht coal dump in Mpumalanga during which 17 suspects were taken in for questioning and three were released,” he said. “The remaining 14 suspects were arrested and are expected to appear before the Emalahleni Magistrates Court on charges of illegal minding and fraud, as they produced a fraudulent certificate for mining.” Mohlala said police confiscated various pieces of equipment, including two TLBs, three front-end loaders, a bulldozer, two coal screeners, a generator, two diesel browsers, a roller, a trailer and a number of cars. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela commended the police and security agencies for working hard in the fight against illegal mining in the province. She warned the community not to get involved in illegal mining as it harmed the economy.
