A FAMILY needs help to exhume their loved one’s body. This after their uncle, Sipho Makhubela (60) from Freedom Park in Soweto, was buried by a government mortuary with three other people. They believe he won’t rest in peace until he’s laid to rest on his own. The family also feels betrayed by the mortuary as it buried him even after they had already said they would fetch the body. Tintswalo Nyoni (31) said her uncle died in October after a hit and run, but they didn’t know until the first week of January. “We hadn’t heard from him in two months and his phone was off. We filed a missing person’s report and the police called us and asked us to identify a body believed to have died from a hit and run,” she said. The family identified the body and indeed it was Sipho. Tintswalo told Daily Sun the mortuary buried him without informing them, while they were making funeral arrangements. She said they were told they needed to pay R10 000 to exhume the body and re-bury it. Daily Sun spoke to the City Parks spokesman, Reggie Moloi who said the body was indeed buried at the Olifantsfontein graveyard. Moloi said the family can find an undertaker to help them with the applications to exhume the body. He said the city only charged R350 for exhuming.
