Gauteng
police were searching for a man who managed to evade arrest during a high-speed
chase on Wednesday. Officers
recovered an AK47 during the incident in Dawn Park. The man
managed to evade arrest, but not before tossing a bag with the firearm from his
vehicle. "Dawn
Park [police] were on a routine crime prevention patrol when they noticed a
suspicious-looking vehicle which sped off when the police approached it,"
said police spokesperson Colonel Dimakatso Sello. Police, as
well as local metro police, gave chase onto the R103 highway, said Sello. "The
suspect dropped a red bag from his vehicle's window, and it was discovered to
be an AK47 assault rifle. The suspect managed to evade arrest," said
Sello. "Anyone
with information that can assist in the investigation is urged to contact their
nearest police station, Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or alternatively leave an
anonymous tip-off on the My SAPS app," Sello added. In an
unrelated incident, police arrested three people for possession of an unlicensed
firearm and ammunition. "Police
in the Tshwane district operationalised information and pounced on three
suspects, aged 34 to 44, in Rosslyn yesterday (Wednesday). The suspects'
vehicle was successfully intercepted by the SAPS members and a search was conducted,"
said Sello. During the
search, police found an unlicensed firearm with the serial number filed off,
ammunition and a jamming device. Further investigations revealed that the
vehicle was positively linked to a hijacking case, and the vehicle was
impounded, Sello said. SOURCE:
