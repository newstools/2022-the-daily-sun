FORGOTTEN TS Galaxy midfielder Karabo Tshepe confirmed that he will be leaving the Rockets at the end of this season. The former Black Leopards star joined Galaxy in the beginning of this season on a one-year contract, but had not played much games due to serious injury he sustained during the pre-season. This season the 32-year-old has played only four DStv Premiership matches for the Mpumalanga-based outfit, and it was under then coach Owen da Gama. After those matches, he sustained a serious knee injury which kept him out of football for three months. “I had this injury during the pre-season and I thought I was fine when the season started, but I was not,” said Tshepe. “It got worse and even now it has not healed well as I am still on attending to doctors. Honestly, I don’t see myself playing again this season and that’s why I will be leaving Galaxy at the end of this season. “I cannot blame them (Galaxy) as they gave me a chance, but injury was a problem for me. I hope I will be fine next season and find a new team and play football again.” A source told SunSport that Galaxy cannot release Tshepe now as they have to look after his injury. So far this season, the Mpumalanga-based outfit have parted ways with the likes of Mohammed Anas, Nation Ndlovu and Luckyboy Mokoena. But the struggling Sead Ramovic’s team have already signed former Tshepe teammate at Leopards, Lefa Hlongwane The talented midfielder joined Galaxy after his contract was ended by Maritzburg United last month due to off field problems. Galaxy are currently bottom on the log with 13 points from 17 league matches. They are on same points with another strugglers Baroka who are above them.
