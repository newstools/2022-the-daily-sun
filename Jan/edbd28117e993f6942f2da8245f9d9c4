NTOSH Gazi has permanently left Mzansi to live in the United Kingdom. The John Vuli Gate singer permanently left Mzansi towards the end of last year. “Initially, I was on tour with my team but I have made the decision to permanently stay here. This is because within the two months I have been here, I have managed to build a huge market this side for amapiano,” he said. “Secondly, I have been presented with endless good opportunities and I have already grabbed a few. As a South African artist, I know the struggles of the industry. I’ve been there and I wasn’t going to let opportunities pass me by.” Ntosh also decided to stay in the UK because jealous people in South Africa were trying to block his success. “I don’t really blame them because there are too many artists fighting for the same spots. Fortunately, an opportunity presented itself for me to spread my wings.” ALSO READ: BUST BRINGS JOY FOR REALITY TV STAR However, Ntosh said making the decision was not easy. “I thought long and hard about this and I felt it was my ticket to a brighter future. “I have consulted my family and friends and they all gave their blessing. I am already adapting to the culture here and how they do things,” he said. Ntosh said there was a lot of opportunity for growth in the UK. “I already do Amapiano Fridays at Smade Lounge in London. “This is a guaranteed gig on a weekly basis, unlike South Africa where I had to beg people for my next gig,” he said. “When I arrived here, I realised so many South Africans want this kind of music. The locals also love it,” he said. “Not so long ago the song Iyo by Diamond Platnumz, featuring Focalistic and me, was on high rotation on BBC Radio. “For the first time in my music career, I’m happy and satisfied,” he said.
