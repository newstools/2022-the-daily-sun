SHE created an OnlyFans account just to upload content on her leisure time, little did she know that it would cost her a job one day. A former cop from Colorado, USA, was forced to quit her job after her colleagues discovered her secret page. According to news.co.au, the 46-year-old woman said she tendered her resignation because she never wanted these two parts of her life to collide. OnlyFans is a subscription social media platform where people share explicit content. The retired cop told Jam Press that she joined the porn platform in May 2020 as a means of spicing up her sex life with her husband, and also decompressing from her difficult and dangerous job. “A lot of the material my husband and I shared is stuff we had taken in our private sex life over the years,” explained the mother of two. “I was working up to 60-hour weeks, so mostly my husband ran the page and shared my pictures, and then sometimes we’d have fun dressing me up and taking photos, especially to share,” she told the publication. She reportedly received a $30 000 (about R465 000) severance package to leave the force.
