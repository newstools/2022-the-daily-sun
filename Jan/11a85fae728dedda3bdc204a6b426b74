A group of skelms ran out of luck after they were bust while
stripping railway cables near Monte Vista in Cape Town on Thursday morning. Prasa spokesperson in the Western Cape Nana Zenani said the thieves
were spotted by security officers who were driving along the N1 from Belville
to Cape Town, opposite Monte Vista. While they driving, security persomnnel noticed a suspect
pulling electrical cables next to an informal settlement in the area. The man
ran away after he saw the security guards, but left four of his colleagues busy
with digging and cutting the cables.  “The suspect proceeded to dump the cable in an attempt to
get rid of the evidence and ran away crossing over N1 freeway. The Security
team proceeded to investigate the scene of the crime and found an additional
four more suspects in the act of illegally digging and pulling Metrorail cables
from the ground. One of the suspects jumped over the wall and fled while the
other accomplices were caught. The three detained suspects were found with 5m
of cable and digging tools,” said Zenani.  The suspect, who had escaped by jumping the fence, did not
go far. He was bust by private security guards and neighbourhood watch members
in the area. Western Cape Prasa regional manager Richard Walker applauded the
joined forces of Prasa security, private security, and the neighbourhood watch. “Although the joint arrests and apprehensions were not
planned, it worked perfectly. The criminals learnt a big lesson that Prasa
Security, Railway Police, Private Security and most especially, our
Neighbourhood Watch groups and communities will not allow the senseless
destruction and criminality against rail infrastructure. That the rule of law
and order will prevail” added Walker.
