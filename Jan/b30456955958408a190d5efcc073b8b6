A MAN who strangled his wife into a coma has been sentenced to nine years in jail. Matome John Dikgale disobeyed a protection order and went to where his wife was staying after moving out of their marital home because of abuse. The Palm Ridge Magistrates Court sentenced him to an effective imprisonment term of nine years on Wednesday, 26 January, for strangling his estranged wife, Nthabiseng Dikgale, until she slipped into a coma and for violating a protection order. Dikgale had pleaded guilty to charges of attempted murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and violation of a protection order on 1 October last year and was convicted on 21 December. Nthabiseng moved out of their marital home as a result of abuse at the hands of the accused and approached the family court for an order to prevent him from entering her new place of residence. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane, said in September 2019, Dikgale ignored the protection order and unlawfully entered the estate where his estranged wife was staying. “This was after calling her several times, requesting to see her,” she said. He then assaulted and strangled her until she lost consciousness. “Fortunately, Nthabiseng had summoned help from the estate’s security personnel, who arrived to find Dikgale strangling her,” said Mjonondwane. She said the NPA commended prosecutor Albert Dwera and investigating officer Captain Kekana for securing a successful prosecution that serves to deter like-minded individuals.
