HE received a payout of about R70 000 in December and was happy. But Solomon Mokolobate (64) from Meadowlands in Soweto has since gone missing. And his family has been looking for him with no luck. His family members believe he was kidnapped, but police registered his case as a missing person’s case as there was no forced entry into his shack. Solomon’s sister, Olebogeng (53), told Daily Sun they noticed on 4 January that Solomon was missing. She said they believe whoever took him was aware of his recent payout as his ID was also missing. “He was also talking to everyone about the money because he was super happy. “We believe that’s the reason he was taken. Nothing else was taken from his place and if this was a robbery, then some things would be missing. It doesn’t make sense for only his ID to be missing,” said Olebogeng. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a missing person’s case was opened and asked SunReaders to help find Solomon.
