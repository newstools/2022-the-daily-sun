The City of Cape Town is warning residents to be extra vigilant of scammers who are posing as its electricity officials to gain access to their homes. "When the City needs to do checks on electricity meters, officials will make the necessary appointment with the resident. Municipal workers and contractors must carry a work order number specific to that dwelling and a City-issued identification card, said mayoral committee member for energy and climate change Beverley van Reenen. She added that residents should ask to check for an official identification card before allowing anyone onto their property. According to the City, the identification card must display its logo, the name and surname of the staff member or mandated contractor, and must contain an embedded photo of the staff member or mandated contractor. "Residents are not to allow anyone onto their premises until they have verified these details. We urge residents to please be vigilant in these cases." Members of the public can verify whether visitors to their home are in fact employed by the City by: Telephoning the call centre on 0860 103 089 to confirm whether work was being carried out in their area. Informing the official that they would allow them entry only once the call centre had verified their identity. Any suspicious behaviour must be reported to the City's law enforcement agencies or the City's fraud hotline on 0800 323 130 or to the police.
