Chris Brown is being sued by a woman who claims the singer drugged and raped her on a yacht docked at Diddy's home in Miami in 2020. The lawsuit was filed by a choreographer, dancer and musician identified as "Jane Doe", TMZ reports. The woman is suing for $20 million in damages. According to the publication, in the suit, the woman claims Chris, who allegedly urged her to come over to the yacht, had given her a drink in a red cup while they were talking. It was after the second drink poured by the singer that she says she began to feel "a sudden, unexplained change in consciousness." She also says that she started to fall "in and out of sleep". In the documents, Jane Doe claims Chris had then led her to a bedroom where he raped her. TMZ reports that the woman mumbled for the singer to stop, but he persisted. She also alleged that the star had texted her the next day, demanding that she take Plan B (the "Morning After Pill"). A lawyer for Jane Doe had also confirmed the lawsuit to Pitchfork. Chris Brown and his team have yet to respond to the allegations.  Channel24
