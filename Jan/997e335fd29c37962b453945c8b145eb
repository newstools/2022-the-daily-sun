FORMER Orlando Pirates striker Justin Shonga is back in the country.According to SunSport source, Shonga has signed with Sekhukhune United. The Zambian international arrived in the country on Thursday to complete the terms with the newbies, who have been surprise packages in their first season in the top flight. Shonga was captured on a free transfer after his contract with Egyptian side Ismaily was terminated a few days ago, having joined them in October last year. However, his stay in Egypt was cut short and the club confirmed the termination of his contract on 1 January. The 25-year-old will be looking to rekindle his career in the PSL, having firstly joined Orlando Pirates in September 2017 from Nkana in Zambia. But he was let go by the Soweto giants at the end of 2019-20 season to join the newly formed then Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). In Limpopo, he didn’t last long, only spending the first half of last season before joining Cape Town City. He struggled with the Mother City club and they decided to let him go in the early stages of last term. He tried his luck at AmaZulu at the beginning of this season, but Usuthu coach Benni McCarthy was concerned about his fitness, saying he doesn’t have much time to wait for him to gain his fitness due to so many games to play. Sekhukhune also signed Rodrick Kabwe, who was previously on the books of Cape Town Spurs (then Ajax Cape Town City) and Black Leopards respectively. The Limpopo club are continuing with their signing spree, after signing 22 players before this season got underway, including Kabwe’s countryman Toaster Nsabata from ZESCO United. The club, after 17 matches played with a return of 25 points which guarantees them they will be top-flight football next season, are eighth on the DStv Premiership log table.
