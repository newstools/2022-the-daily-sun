A woman from the US claims that drinking her morning pee twice a week makes her skin glow and her complexion fairer. Ruby Karyo says that has been drinking her own pee and rubbing it on her face for over a decade and she claims it improves her skin and overall health and she has been doing so since she was 19 years old. The 30 year old mum says her dad introduced her to 'urine therapy' when she was just 19 and it has been working well for her. Urine therapy or urotherapy, (also urinotherapy, uropathy, or auto-urine therapy) in alternative medicine is the application of human urine for medicinal or cosmetic purposes, including drinking of one's own urine and massaging one's skin, or gums, with one's own urine. There is no scientific evidence that exists to support any beneficial health claims of urine therapy. Ruby says she splashes the pee on her face and uses it as a moisturiser, claiming it helps her get a glowing complexion.
