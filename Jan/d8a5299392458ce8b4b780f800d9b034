THE case against Ntuthuko Shoba has been postponed once again. The 33-year-old former JSE analyst is accused of organising the murder of his girlfriend Tshegofatso Pule, who was eight months pregnant, in June 2020. He is facing charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and defeating the ends of justice. His trial was supposed to start on Monday, 17 January but it had to be postponed for the state and the defence to clarify some matters concerning cellphone evidence. Shoba is accused of hiring Muzikayise Malepane (31) to murder Pule. Malepane pleaded guilty to the murder and told the court he was hired by Shoba, who didn’t want his wife to find out Pule was pregnant. Pule’s uncle Tumisang Katake said he was disappointed by the postponement. “I believe they had enough time to prepare for the trial. The trial was due to start in October but it had to be postponed as the defence stated they needed more time to consult with their client,” he said. “The more they delay, the more the family’s agony continues. It’s emotionally taxing.” Pule was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort, with multiple stab wounds to her upper body. The matter will be back in the South Gauteng High Court on Monday, 24 January.
