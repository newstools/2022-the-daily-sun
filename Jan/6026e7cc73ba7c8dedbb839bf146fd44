Mum Gladys Makatshaba told Daily Sun her family was still devastated following the death of her 15-year-old son. Her son was hit by a car on 15 October in Chiawelo, Soweto, last year and died at the scene. Gladys said the man behind the wheel showed no remorse. After he hit her son, he tried to flee the scene but taxi drivers followed him and brought him back. She said she was at work when she received news about her son but the family only told her he had been hit by a car. “Earlier that day I found my mum lying on the floor. The family said they don’t know what was happening with her,” she said. Gladys said this was a sign that something had horribly gone wrong. ALSO READ | TAXI BOSS GUNNED DOWN! She said when she arrived home she was told that her mum had even fainted when she heard the news. She said her the man has never been arrested and she doesn’t understand what’s going on with the case. “If he was really sorry, he would have come to our home and apologise or even helped with funeral arrangements,” said Gladys. “If he had done that, we would have forgiven him because we’re not a hostile family. We know mistakes do happen. Instead, he kept quiet as if nothing had happened.” ALSO READ | SUNPOWER TO GRAVE MIX-UP RESCUE!
