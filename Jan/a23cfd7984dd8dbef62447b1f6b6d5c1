The ANC in the Western Cape is gatvol over the plan to
appoint former MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela as a special advisor to Premier Alan
Winde. This is after Madikizela resigned from his positions as DA
leader in the Western Cape and MEC of Transport and Public works in April last
week. He took the decision to quit the top posts following
allegations that he had lied on his CV that he possess a BCom degree. The ANC’s leader of the opposition in the Provincial
Parliament Cameron Dugmore said they are “furious” by the move to appoint
Madikizela to be a special advisor. Dugmore said: “Madikizela was unfit to hold public office.
What can he advise the Premier about? How to be deceptive? We call on the
National Department of Public Service and Administration not to ratify Premier
Winde’s cynical attempt to restore Madikizela to public life. Premier Winde has
accommodated former MEC Donald Grant in his office and now he is accommodating
Madikizela. This is blatant cadre accommodation.” Daily Sun spoke to Madikizela who said the matter was best
to be answered by the premier’s office. He said he had not signed any contract
so he was not able to discuss the matter any further. Premier Winde’s office confirmed that indeed plans to bring
Madikizela to replace Donald Grant, who retired last year, is onboard. Cayla Murray, spokesperson to the premier, said the
appointment has not yet been finalised, as the National Department of Public
Service and Administration must first vet the application in line with
associated regulations. Murray added that Western Cape Government is currently
undertaking a strategic review, to improve its service delivery to communities
and the Premier is beefing up advisory capacity in that area. “As a former MEC of Human Settlements and Transport and
Public Works, Mr Madikizela has the experience and expertise required to
provide this advisory capacity to the premier,” she added.
