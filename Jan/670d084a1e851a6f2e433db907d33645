INMATES have been thirsty since Saturday, 22 January. There has not been a drop of water at Westville Correctional Facility in KZN, forcing them to relieve themselves in plastic bags and then throw kak through the windows. They told Daily Sun that inmates who needed to take medication were not able to because they had no water. A jailbird said on Sunday, they were given four slices of bread with no tea. “We didn’t get tea because there is no water. This is sad because nobody informed us of this crisis or how long it will last for,” he said. “We are not even given water to drink. We know we are prisoners but this unfair.” Another inmate said it was unacceptable to be going through this while the country was still facing Covid-19. “We are in a bad situation and appeal to authorities to intervene. This is unfair and it happens often,” he said. KZN Correctional Services spokesman Thulani Mdluli said the issue was affecting the whole Westville area. “However, water has been restored by the municipality. Offenders were informed of the challenge,” he said. Mdluli thanked management for ensuring the situation did not get out of hand.
