GOSPEL star Kholeka Dubula has expressed concern over Covid-19 not being taken seriously in some rural areas. The Ndiyakholwa hitmaker poured her heart out to SunBuzz. She said rural areas were facing a ticking time bomb because of ignorance. Kholeka from Nqadu Village in Willowvale, Eastern Cape, said it pained her that adherence to Covid-19 regulations was non-existent among some villagers. She visited her home village over the Christmas holidays, and revealed how “appalled” she was at watching some people attending gatherings without wearing any mask.

It seems the only time they think of a mask is when they visit grocery stores in town, where the no-mask-no-entry rule applies. It’s sad,” said Kholeka. “It’s as if some people treat Covid-19 as a thing of the past, forgetting that it is not only still with us but also deadly.” With the Eastern Cape among Mzansi provinces with the high infection rate, the award-winning singer said government has done enough to spread awareness. “But I think some people just choose not to listen. We can’t put the blame on government. For instance, there are many media awareness campaigns,” she said. “But regrettably, there are still some people who choose to ignore them.” Like many artists, Kholeka said she couldn’t wait for stadiums to reopen so that she could, once again, be able to perform in front of bigger crowds.
