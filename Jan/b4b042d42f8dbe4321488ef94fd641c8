After years of being out of the spotlight, actress and TV presenter Phuti Khomo has scored a major acting gig. She has joined the cast of 1Magic’s drama series Entangled, where she takes on the role of Sharon, who the story revolves around. Speaking to SunBuzz, Phuti said she didn’t know how much she missed being in front of the camera until she was on set performing scenes. “I was very excited when I was called for the role. Getting back into the television space has been something I have been meaning to do ever since I took the conscious decision to take a break and focus on my businesses. I missed being on set.” Phuti, who hasn’t done any television work in four years, said she has been busy with her non-profit organisation called Tsoga Mo Afrika, which aims at township economic development. She said she’s been enjoying herself.

Had I continued with acting, I would have spread myself too thin and one thing would have suffered. “But right now, they’ve grown to a point where they don’t need constant supervising,” she said. The actress, who’s been part of many productions such as Muvhango, said she enjoyed stepping into Sharon’s shoes as the role allowed her to fulfil some of her acting fantasies, like doing a scene in the rain. “It was so beautiful, even though I struggled because the rain kept going into my eyes.” She said people, especially women, will love Sharon because they’ll find the things she goes through relatable.
