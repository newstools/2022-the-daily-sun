ZIMBABWE have named a familiar squad for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals which kick-off in Cameroon next month. Warriors coach Norman Mapeza has included Golden Arrows striker Knox Mutizwa, former Kaizer Chiefs forward Knowledge Musona and former Orlando Pirates versatile player Marshal Munetsi in his squad. There’s a call up for JDR Stars midfielder Temptation Chiwunga, who has scored two goals in 17 matches for the GladAfrica Championship side this season. Former SuperSport United flop striker Prince Dube and Matsatsantsa’s veteran left back Onismor Bhasera are also in the squad. However, Zimbabwe’s pursuit to have Khama Billiat to change his mind to retire from international football was unsuccessful. He is not part of the squad. Billiat confirmed his retirement in November after Zimbabwe finished bottom of World Cup Group G qualifiers with two points. Zimbabwe are aiming to navigate a tough Group B with Senegal, who lost the last Afcon final to Algeria in 2019, Guinea and Malawi. The Warriors have never progressed to the knockout stages. Zimbabwe, who will feature in the continental tournament for the third time in a row, have not won an Afcon finals match in the last two editions. They have lost four of the six group stage matches in those editions. They last won an Afcon finals match in 2006 when they shocked Ghana beating them 2-1. They will open next year’s Afcon finals against Senegal on 10 January which will be followed by a clash against Malawi four days later, before concluding the group with a date against Guinea on 18 January.
