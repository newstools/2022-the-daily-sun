THE PSL seem to have succumbed to mounting pressure amplified by EFF leader Julius Malema that fans must return to stadium. The party marched to the office of Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa yesterday picketing around Tshwane, demanding that they open up stadiums. Yesterday in Durban, the PSL revealed that they will open the Moses Mabhida Stadium to 2 000 fans for the inaugural DStv Compact Cup semi-finals tomorrow. Malema hit out at PSL bosses of being scared to challenge government, saying political parties are hosting rallies at sporting venues but fans are not to be spectators at the same facilities. Not that the 2 000 ratio is anything new, but it was gazetted by government in October last year. And tomorrow’s double header semi-finals between Coastal United, mentored by Golden Arrows coach Lehlohonolo Seema, lock horns with Dinaledi FC, coached Dan Malesela. The match will kick off at 3pm. The second semi-final will see Warriors, coached by Swallows FC mentor Dylan Kerr, against Steve Barker’s Amabutho, who is the coach of Stellenbosch FC, at 6pm. The finals will be played on 29 January where losing semi-finalists will meet at noon, while finalists will meet at 2.30pm, with all these games taking place at FNB Stadium. Ironically, the 2010 World Cup stadium is the first venue that allowed 2 000 fans this season, first with the MTN8 final in October last year, since March 2020. Warriors coach Kerr is excited that fans will be allowed to the stadium, saying football has not been the same since played in the empty stands. “You guys would agree with me that football is not football without fans,” said Kerr. “You can see with the Africa Cup of Nations (ongoing in Cameroon), there are fans and I think it’s now time to see fans come back to the stadiums. “And I feel for the players to have been playing football without supporters. “To a large extent players don’t showcase their talent enough without supporters.”
