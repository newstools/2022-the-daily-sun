This thing of charging people for using public toilets at the malls is unacceptable. I am disappointed by shopping malls in rural areas and townships that charge people for using the toilet. Why are customers expected to pay for using a toilet at the same mall they are spending money at? Shopping malls in suburbs don’t charge customers because they value them. Please stop this. Some customers protected these malls, free of charge, from criminals during the July unrest. Soshanguve
