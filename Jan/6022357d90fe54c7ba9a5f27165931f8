EGYPT’S quest to win their eighth Africa Cup of Nations title remains alive after eliminating Ivory Coast 5-4 on penalties yesterday. The two nations played to an intriguing goalless draw in regular time, and Egypt emerged victorious after a penalty shootout at Japoma Stadium. Liverpool star and Egypt captain Mohamed Salah led by example, converting the winning penalty to send his nation to the tournament’s quarter-finals. Egypt are the most successful team in the competition’s history and are looking to win the tournament for the eighth time. Goalkeepers Mohammed El Shenawy of Egypt and Badra Ali Sangar were outstanding throughout the 90 minutes. They made incredible saves from both ends to send the match to extra time. El Shenawy was substituted in the 88th minute of the match, with Abo Gabal taking his place. Gabal saved Eric Baily spot-kick, while Egypt converted all their penalties to set a date with Morocco in the quarter-finals on at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium Sunday (30 January). The quarter-final fixture was initially billed to take place at Olembe Stadium but, the Confederation of African Football confirmed the change of venue and called for an immediate investigation into the stampede that happened at Olembe. This was after eight spectators were reported to have died in a crush outside the Stadium, which was hosting the last-16 game between hosts Cameroon and Comoros. To reach the last-16, Egypt finished second in Group D behind Nigeria to set up the clash against the Elephants. On the other end, Ivory Coast were in what looked like a tricky Group E but the abysmal performance of defending champions Algeria made passage as group winners much smoother as Patrice Beaumelle’s side finished top with seven points. However, their journey came to an end on Wednesday night.
