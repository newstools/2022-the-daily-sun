Gatvol parents are threatening to pull their kids from two local schools they say are putting their safety at risk. Parents in Allandale, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, say pupils at Mzimba Secondary School and nearby Ndwandwe Primary School are forced to learn in rain-damaged buildings with the sun beating down on them. Both schools were damaged by violent storms between 2019 and 2021. When the SunTeam visited, kids were sitting in a roofless classroom with huge holes in the floor. Even the windows of the mobile classrooms were damaged. School governing body chairman Confidence Chiloane said: “This situation is demoralising. The school (Mzimba Secondary) used to have 400 pupils but there are now 340 left with 15 teachers. Most of the parents are now angry and are removing their kids from this death trap schools. Six classrooms are collapsing. “Snakes slither around during lessons. We have to send our kids to school with umbrellas to protect them from the sun.” SGB treasurer Macdonald Malapane said the storms damaged stationery, furniture and copy machines. “We have written to the department but nothing has happened.” Education department spokesman Jasper Zwane said: “We are attending to the matter with circuit managers and we will be appointing contractors to fix the school. We have procured mobile classrooms for all affected schools across the province,” he said. “As you are aware, heavy rain damaged many schools in the province. We request that parents be patient with us.”
