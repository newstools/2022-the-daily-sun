She joins the second season alongside new faces – reality TV personality Thobile Mseleku and TikTok sensation Jojo Robinson. The trio joins season one personalities Sorisha Naidoo, Nonku Williams, Annie Ludick and Nonkanyiso “LaConco” Conco. Londie, real name Londiwe Zulu, is married to businessman Hlubi Nkosi and they have a son together. She said her reason behind joining the show was so people could get to know the real her. “Since I’ve become a wife and mother, I thought it would be a great idea for the public to see how I’m rebranding myself. People know me as this sexy singer, but don’t really know my personality and what I’m about outside of the entertainment industry. So, when I got the opportunity to be one of the housewives, I thought it was a great way for me to connect with a new audience,” she said.

I used to be based in Joburg and now that I’ve moved to Durban, I don’t really have a lot of friends yet. So, it was nice to have people who work hard and are also able to have fun. I’m just enjoying having new friends.” She said putting her personal life out there was the most challenging part. “I had to bring my mum and husband in. My child is also going to be on TV and I haven’t even posted his face on social media. At first, I was like: ‘Do I really want to do this?’. Then I was like: ‘Okay, for once, let me just tell my story’ rather than letting other people do so,” she said, further sharing on the journey. “When the show was starting and we were still shooting the first and second episodes, there were awkward moments between Nonku and I, but I wouldn’t say we didn’t gel. We had a bit of a rough start, but we’re good now.” The Real Housewives of Durban premieres on Friday, 28 January, on Showmax.
