This week has been the wildest ride of my life. I had no idea it was possible to learn, evolve and thrive so much in such a short period,” she wrote. “Last night, I was heartbroken to not have been placed but when I woke up this morning my perspective had changed. I’m so proud that I came as myself and I did not compromise. I’m grateful for this experience. I met amazing queens who expanded my view of the world and I’ve made such real connections that transcend borders and that for me is priceless.” Her comment section was filled with love from her followers and Mrs South Africa 2022 Jo Judnick-Wilson. During her week in Entertainment Capital of the World, she shared updates from her arrival to meeting the other wives, rehearsals, meeting with the other wives, touring the city, the gift exchange ceremony and her interview.
