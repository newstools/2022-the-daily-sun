The way Eskom is treating the people of Mzansi is very disturbing. It seems like someone knows something about load shedding but the answers they give us are jokes. There are too many risks when the lights go off. Even crime rises when there’s no power and thugs do as they please. I would like Eskom to respect us because we’re buy electricity and it’s expensive. ) Tshepo Max
