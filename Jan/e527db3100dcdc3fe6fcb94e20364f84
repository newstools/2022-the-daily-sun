MZANSI is not doing enough to fight corruption. This is according to Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index, which was released on Tuesday, 25 January. It showed that the country was at a standstill in its efforts to stop corruption, as human rights abuses and the erosion of democracy increased. The index is the leading global indicator of public sector corruption. It ranks 180 countries and territories according to how people view levels of public sector corruption with zero being highly corrupt and 100 being very clean. Mzansi’s standing on the index since 2012 has not changed over the last 10 years. In 2012, South Africa scored 43, ranking at 69 out of 176 countries. Last year, the country scored a dismal 44, dropping one place in rank to 70 out of 180 countries. “It is extremely disheartening to find ourselves, year after year, in the same position on the index,” said Karam Singh, executive director of Corruption Watch. “The poor perceptions of how South Africa is faring in its efforts to tackle and dismantle the systems that enable corruption are perhaps to be expected when one considers the staggering levels of corruption we have witnessed.” Singh said as a civil society organisation working hard to expose the gaps that enable corruption, and find solutions for creating a society free from this scourge, they hoped things would change. He said evidence at the Zondo Commission proved there was a systematic weakening of law enforcement and prosecution agencies during the state capture years.
