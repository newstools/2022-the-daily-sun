MANY people have lost their lives because of road rage that could have simply been resolved. A video of a road rage incident has surfaced on social media, and it was between a Honda Accord and a Ford F-150 Raptor. In the dashcam video, the person who posted the video claims the Accord nearly hit them before the incident. “This Accord nearly sideswiped me, then decides to play chicken with the Raptor almost hitting him. I guess that pisses the Raptor off and that’s when the video starts,” read the video description. The two vehicles can be seen competing for a position on the road, with the F-150 Raptor appearing to intentionally get in the Accord’s way. That, however, may have made the situation worse. As the Ford blocks the Accord, the driver goes on the shoulder and tries to dodge around a Honda CR-V but manages to hit a bakkie, causing the car to lose control. The Accord slides off the road, into a cliffside causing it to flip, and it comes to a stop on its roof.
