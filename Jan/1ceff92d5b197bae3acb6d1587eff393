I thought I was going to die,” he said. ALSO READ: GABOLA PASTOR: PRAY FOR ME! “I had just come back from patrol. My biggest sin was to ask them who they were. After the assault they tied me with cable ties.” One man stayed behind to guard him while the others went to the pump station to cut the copper cable. “The thugs left at 3am and left me tied up. I was in severe pain. They took my cellphone. I thank my ancestors that I’m still alive,” he said. Samson said he was found by his colleague when he came to change shifts in the morning. Both his legs and hands were swollen. He opened a case with the police. “This is the second time this has happened. I was first attacked in June in the same situation,” he said.
