A 41-year-old North West man was arrested for allegedly luring his estranged wife to his home, after which she was raped and doused with petrol. The man also threatened to set the woman alight. The woman managed to escape and reported the matter to the police. The man was subsequently arrested. He was charged with rape and attempted murder - and was expected to appear at the Mogwase Magistrate's Court on Monday. The spokesperson for the North West police, Colonel Amanda Funani, said information at their disposal was that the couple had been separated for three years. They have two boys who live with the woman at her parental home. The man, said Funani, allegedly called his estranged wife and asked that they meet to discuss an urgent matter. As per agreement, the estranged husband collected the wife from her parental home on Wednesday afternoon and then drove towards a local mall. However, he changed direction and headed to their house in Lerome village, near Mogwase, outside Rustenburg, Funani said. "Subsequent to an argument that ensued after the pair's arrival in Lerome, the husband allegedly assaulted and strangled the wife with a rope, then poured her with petrol [sic], and eventually raped her. "Consequent to the rape, the suspect allegedly forced the victim into his car and drove away with her. However, the victim managed to unlock the car and jumped out. "She was assisted by a Good Samaritan, who was walking along the road. He took the victim to the police station, where charges of attempted murder and rape were laid, leading to the arrest of the suspect on Thursday." North West police commissioner Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena condemned the incident, and congratulated Mogwase detectives for arresting the man. Kwena said gender-based violence would not be tolerated and alleged perpetrators would be dealt with effectively.
