LIGHTS are on the brink of being switched off in Tshwane as the city battles to pay Eskom the millions it owes. On Thursday, 27 January, the troubled power utility said it met with Mayor Randall Williams and his leadership team on Tuesday in an effort to recover the debt. Eskom said the total debt owed by the city was R635 million, which was due and payable by 18 January. “The city‘s payment patterns have been irregular over the past six months and have contributed negatively to Eskom’s increasing overdue debt, which is in excess of R43,8 billion. “Over the past months, we have engaged the city on these irregular payments and the impact they have on Eskom to keep the lights on,” the utility said. News24 reported that the mayor’s spokesman Sipho Stuurman told Fin24 that Williams would issue a comment on the matter later on Thursday. “We will draft a response soon. The mayor and MMCs are engaged in a council meeting. As soon as they are out, we will issue a statement and response,” he said.
