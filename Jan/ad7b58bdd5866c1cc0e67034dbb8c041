MALAWI are on the verge of reaching the Africa Nations Cup knockout stages for the first time in their history following a goalless draw with Senegal at Stade Omnisports de Bafoussam, in Cameroon. The Flames will have to wait until Thursday for their qualification to be confirmed depending on other results. Malawi will qualify as one of the third best nations having collected four points, while Senegal qualified by being top of Group B on five points. Guinea progressed to the knockout phase as they finished in second spot on four points despite losing 2-1 to Zimbabwe in the other match. Malawi came into the match in high spirit having registered their second ever win in the finals beating Zimbabwe 2-1 last Friday. They have been promised bonuses by Malawian president Lazarus Chakwera if they reach the knockout phase. The teams last met in July last year with Senegal beating Malawi 2-1 in the Cosafa Cup match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Gqeberha. Malawi played without their influential captain Limbikani Mzava who sustained a hamstring injury against Zimbabwe and is expected to be in the casualty room for six weeks. The Flames coach Marian Marinica was on the bench for the first time as he was in self-isolation after he tested positive for Covid-19. His assistant Meck Mwase has been at the helm in his absence on the dug-out. Senegal had a full strength starting line-up boosted by the return of Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and captain Kalidou Koulibaly who were ruled out of action after they tested positive for Covid-19. The Lions of Teranga were hoping to improve their poor scoring record having scored just once in the tournament so far that from the penalty spot via the boot of Liverpool star Sadio Mane to beat Zimbabwe 1-0 in their opening match. Malawi almost won the match as referee Blaise Ngwa made a controversial decision to deny them a penalty in the 74th minute after Sarr had fouled Gomezgani Chirwa inside the box.
