SUPERSPORT United run the risk of losing star midfielder Sipho Mbule, who is one of the club’s most sought after footballers. Mbule’s contract with SuperSport ends at the end of the season, but the Tshwane giants have an option to renew. However, both parties have until the end of May to exercise that option. It is strange for SuperSport not to have sorted out the talented Mbule’s contract considering he has caught the attention of Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs. The player’s agent, Mike Makaab, revealed that he will leave Durban this week and travel to Joburg to have showdown talks with SuperSport on whether they will exercise the option, or they’ll wait until the end of May. Inside Mbule’s camp, there have been disagreements between the player and SuperSport over a number of things, including the off the field problems which have set him back a bit. In 17 DStv Premiership matches, SuperSport have played this season, Mbule has started just five with two goals. He last played for coach Kaitano Tembo’s side in a 2-2 draw against Sundowns at Loftus Stadium on 24 November. “All is expected to be clear in May,” said Makaab. Mbule first shone for SuperSport in the 2017-18 season, scoring a cracking strike in the Caf Confederation Cup final first leg against Congolese side TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi. Since then, he has reached three MTN8 cups, winning two of them and losing the other with the Tshwane giants. But he might be out of the United exit door alongside his close friend and teammate Teboho Mokoena, who SunSport revealed a few days ago is wanted by Sundowns and Belgium giants RSC Anderlecht. The clubs have tabled offers of R20 and R25 million respectively, and SuperSport are deciding which one to accept.
