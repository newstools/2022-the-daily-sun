IF this Cameroon Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tournament was anything to be taken lightly, then one would tick on Senegal to cruise past Cape Verde tonight. But because this year’s Cup of Nations has taken a dramatic turn like Climate Change on the continent, the result of this last-16 clash, set for Kouekong Stadium tonight (6pm), could bring another conflicting result. The Lions of Teranga, armed with players such as Liverpool star Sadio Mane, have mauled the islanders 14 times in their 18 matches played so far, and the other two went to Cape Verde and two draws. But don’t bet on that stat tonight, or fact that Senegal were losing finalists in the 2019 Afcon, a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to Algeria. And the Lions returned to their allocated grounds of the Tagidor Hotel Sports Complex where they are comfortable, according to their official site, having tasted the training grounds again on Sunday. And remember, the sun keeps shining bright for Senegal with each match after Algeria, the defending champions, were knocked out in the groups by Equatorial Guinea, leaving the cup hanging from a tree like an ripe apple for anyone to pick. And another tournament favourites, Nigeria’s Super Eagles, are also eating dust after being kicked on the backside by Tunisia, leaving Senegal, Cameroon and Egypt as stronger candidates. But it’s a cup of shocks, anything can happen, even at the Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo where Morocco host Malawi at 9pm tonight, anything could still happen, be warned.“The Lions of Senegal trained this Sunday at the Tagidor Sports Complex, which they had not walked on since the day before their match against Malawi,” the Senegalese revealed in a statement.“The squad was complete with the exception of Bouna Sarr, put to rest. Central defender Abdoulaye Seck, who had not trained with the team for 10 days, and midfielder Pape Matar Sarr, absent for two sessions, joined the group for the 90 minutes session.“The band at Sadio Mane was able to work on passing circuits and increase efficiency in front of goal.”The Lions were scheduled to have a friendly yesterday with an unannounced team at the Tagidor Hotel grounds.But surely the 2019 wounds of losing in the final have been open and they’d be hoping to go one better.This could be a new lease on life for the Senegalese in the knockout phase, but if they are to come about as they did in the group stages, they might find the going tough.Mane scored through a late penalty, seven minutes into additional time when they beat Zimbabwe in their opening match.The islanders, Cape Verde, must be aware they’re lucky to be in this stage with the big boys after qualified as one of the best eight third-placed clubs with four points.
