Free State
police have arrested nine people in in connection with an alleged mob justice
killing. It is
alleged that the nine people beat a man to death on Monday after they accused
him of stealing their belongings in Kgoptjane. According
to police, an eyewitness saw a group of people, armed with sjamboks, approach
the man and beat him until he became unconscious. "An
ambulance was summoned to the crime scene, and a person identified as Themba
Petrus Pali, 25, of Semphurwaneng section of Bolata Village in QwaQwa was
declared dead. The suspects were also found at the crime scene in possession of
sjamboks, and nine of them were arrested and detained," police
spokesperson Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said. The nine
people, aged 21 to 39, are expected to appear in the Tseki Magistrate's Court
on Wednesday on charges of murder. This is the
second alleged mob justice incident in the province in a week. Police are
trying to identify a man who was allegedly beaten to death in a mob justice
attack in Morago Trust after he was accused of stealing livestock. The man
died in Pelonomi hospital in Bloemfontein last Monday. Police
spokesperson Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said that no arrests were made. Commenting
on the incident in Kgoptjane, Free State police commissioner Lieutenant General
Baile Motswenyane said: "Taking the law into one's hands has never been a
solution within any society to curb crime. "When
patrolling our villages...it doesn't give us the right to assault any person
suspected of having committed any form of crime. The person must be apprehended
and handed over to the police without any injuries. "Everyone
is regarded as innocent until proven guilty before the court of law. I want to
applaud the police for arrests made." SOURCE:
