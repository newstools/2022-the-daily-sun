SOME schools may not be able to start teaching when they open again. With the Eastern Cape schools re-opening on Wednesday, 19 January, these schools are still waiting for textbooks and stationery. This is according to a letter written to principals by Education Department acting deputy director-general Tembani Mtyida on Wednesday, 12 January. Mtyida blamed the delay in delivering learning and teaching support material on budget problems. He said a severe budget shortfall had made things very difficult. In a letter to principals, he wrote: “Steps to resolve the challenge included consultation with the Basic Education Department and the provincial treasury and funds were made available in December. “However, the procurement process could not proceed because some key role players were already gone for the December holidays. Even with the available budget, the department could not afford to provide all textbook items as previously.” He said the first phase of delivery saw 748 schools receiving stationery. “From 12 to 25 January, we will deliver stationery to 1 614 schools as part of phase two and for phase three, 196 schools will receiving their stationery between January and February. “All schools across the province will receive their textbooks between March and May. The department regrets any inconvenience caused by the delay in the supply and delivery.” Mtyida recommended that schools use some of the stationery provided last year until this year’s delivery arrived. Department spokesman Malinbongwe Mtima confirmed the delay. “Currently, we are busy with phase two of our plan and we will distribute stationery up until the first week of February,” he said. A principal, who didn’t want to be named, said the delay would cause setbacks. “The textbooks go with the handbooks and now some teachers will use a shortage of textbooks as an excuse not to teach,” he said.
