WHAT started as a search for a stolen wig ended in a drug bust on Friday, 21 January. Cops following up on a complaint about a stolen wig stumbled upon drugs in Eersterust, Tshwane. Police spokesman Sergeant Sam Shibambo told Daily Sun: “The SAPS received a complaint from a mother who alleged that her daughter stole her wig. “The police located the woman’s daughter at a certain house. While they were questioning her about the missing wig, they noticed a ziplock bag containing a powdery substance protruding from her pocket. “She was searched and police found three packets of drugs suspected to be cat. Her male companion began acting uneasy and he was also searched.” Shibambo said the police searched the man and found four packets suspected to contain tik in his pockets. “Police also found an elderly man packaging pills suspected to be Mandrax. “They found a scale he allegedly used to weigh the suspected drugs. They acted swiftly and arrested him for possession and dealing in drugs,” he said. Shibambo said the three suspects appeared in the Hatfield Magistrates Court on charges of possession and dealing in drugs.
