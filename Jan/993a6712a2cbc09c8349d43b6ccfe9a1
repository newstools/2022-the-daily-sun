MAFIKIZOLO member Theo Kgosinkwe and his wife Vourne tied the knot for the second this weekend. The couple already got married in 2020 but only invited immediate family due to Covid-19 restrictions. They finally got their big wedding on Saturday, 29 January and it was attended by people such as fellow Mafikizolo singer Nhlanhla Mafu, Brinnette Seopela, Simphiwe Majola, and Sibulele Sibaca. The guests took to social media to share pictures of themselves at the wedding. Theo and Vourne have been together for four years and recently welcomed their first daughter earlier last year.
