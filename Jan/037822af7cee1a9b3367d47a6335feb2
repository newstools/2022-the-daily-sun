Lions and pumas at a zoo in the South African capital of
Pretoria got severe Covid-19 from asymptomatic zoo handlers, raising concerns
that new variants could emerge from animal reservoirs of the disease, studies
carried out by a local university showed. A 2020 study of faeces from two pumas that had had
diarrhoea, nasal discharge and anorexia showed the animals had Covid-19 and
made a full recovery after 23 days, the University of Pretoria said in a
statement on Tuesday. A year later, in the midst of South Africa’s
delta-variant-driven third wave, three lions, one of which had pneumonia,
tested positive for the coronavirus. The studies add to evidence that while the dominant theory
is that the coronavirus spread from animals to humans, the reverse can also
happen. Data suggests that the disease was circulating among staff at the time
of the lions’ illness and the disease was likely transferred from them to the
big cats. The disease could then mutate in the animals and reinfect humans, the
researchers said. Measures such as mask-wearing and infection control when
dealing with captive animals, as well as barriers so that visitors to zoos
can’t get too close to them, are advisable, the researchers said in the
statement. 'This is to protect endangered species from getting sick and
dying,” Marietjie Venter and Katja Koeppel, two professors at the university,
said in the statement. “These measures are also important because of the risk
of new variants emerging if the virus establishes itself in other animal
reservoirs; these variants could be transmitted back to humans.” Since the pandemic began, minks infected with the
coronavirus in Denmark have been culled and Hong Kong said on Tuesday that
2,000 small animals including hamsters would be culled after some tested
positive for the disease.
