A MAN (32) hacked to death a gunman for allegedly killing his brother (24) at their parental home in Tunda outside Tonga, Mpumalanga on Monday morning, 10 January. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said: “Police received information that a 32-year-old male suspect shot and killed a 24-year-old man at his house at about 2am. Upon hearing gunshots, the deceased’s younger brother got out and found his brother’s body with gunshot wounds. He allegedly attacked the gunman immediately with a sharp object repeatedly until he succumbed to the injuries. “Police at Tonga were alerted and when they arrived at the scene, they were surprised to find two bodies, as well as a firearm. The suspect in the second murder was still on the scene. Two cases of murder were opened by the police and a 22-year-old man was arrested and the two weapons confiscated for investigation.” Mohlala said the motives for the two murders were unknown at this stage, but police were investigating. Mpumalanga commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela strongly condemned the brutal murders. “We urge the public to refrain from taking the law into their hands when crime has been committed. Instead, report crime to the authorities and then allow the law to take its course,” she said. The 22-year-old murder suspect is expected to appear in the Nkomazi Magistrates Court soon.
