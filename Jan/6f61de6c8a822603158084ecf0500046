POLICE have arrested suspects found with stolen vehicles suspected to be used in the commission of cash-in-transit robberies. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun that six suspects who were found in possession of high performance vehicles that were reported stolen, also suspected to be used in the commission of serious and violent crimes that include cash-in-transit robberies, were arrested last night. “Four suspects were arrested in Oaklands, Joburg, while two suspects were arrested in Boksburg,” said Masondo. He said police received information through Crime Intelligence about a safe house in Oaklands, where there were high performance vehicles and suspects who might be involved in cash-in-transit robberies. “Police officers from the Highway Patrol Unit, Flying Squad and Vision Security proceeded to the safe house and spotted suspects tampering with the engine of a Ford Ranger,” he said. “On seeing the police, the suspects fled on foot while shooting at the cops. Police managed to arrest four of the suspects,” he added.  Masondo said preliminary investigation revealed that the Ford Ranger was stolen in Olievenhoutbosh in December last year, and the Mercedes-Benz was stolen in Wonderboomproot in June 2013. “Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects who fled. In a separate incident, police arrested two suspects in Boksburg after they were found with a Toyota Hilux and Audi Q7 that were reported stolen in Alexandra and Roodepoort, respectively,” said Masondo. He also said information was received by the police about a workshop in Boksburg, where stolen and hijacked vehicles are stored. Masondo said police stormed into the workshop and found two high performance vehicles that were reportedly stolen. “The four suspects arrested in Oaklands will appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court, while the suspects arrested in Boksburg are expected to appear in the Boksburg Magistrates Court in due course,” said Masondo.
