ON 7 December last year, Daily Sun published the story of two siblings, Ayola (1) and Akhanani Bulani (6), who died in a shack fire in Kraaifontein, Cape Town. Now family member, Nompumelelo Bukulu (42) has told Daily Sun they were struggling to raise R10 000 to give the kids a dignified burial. “We can’t move on with our lives because we haven’t buried the kids. “Their death is so painful to us. “They should have been buried by now. We don’t know what to do,” said Nompumelelo. On the day of the incident, the kids were alone at home when the fire started. “We attended a stokvel meeting and left the kids with a 14-year-old child. “We never thought she would leave the kids alone,” she said. Nompumelelo was shocked after she got a call on the day, informing her there was fire at their home. She said when she arrived home, the fire was out of control and they couldn’t do anything to save the kids. “We often see people getting help through the People’s Paper. “That is why we contacted Daily Sun. We are hoping to get help from the people of Mzansi,” she said. “The fact that the kids are still in the mortuary is haunting me.”
