LIMPOPO police have launched a manhunt for two lovebirds after they allegedly shot and killed two men in an apparent case of road rage. It is alleged that the woman’s car keys were taken by the motorist whose stationary vehicle she had hit. The motorist, Lawrence Masia (32), was with his neighbour Jeffrey Masetla (38) at the scene when a suspect believed to be the woman’s boyfriend arrived. The suspect shot both Jeffrey and Lawrence and fled the scene in a white Nissan NP 200 bakkie. The shocking incident happened on Saturday, 1 January in Roerfontein Village in Sekgosese, Limpopo. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said cops received a complaint of a shooting that took place next to a hotel and quickly rushed to the scene. “The suspects had already left the scene. Both victims were transported with private vehicles and one of the cars overturned. The victim succumbed to his injuries. The other victim died upon arrival at the hospital,” he said. Police have opened cases of murder, attempted murder and culpable homicide. Anyone with information that can assist the police in the arrest of the suspects is requested to contact the investigating officer, Warrant Officer David Maseakwala, on 079 809 0993, CrimeStop on 08600 10111, the nearest police station or the MySAPSApp.
