MOST people have mistaken the refurbished Setlabotjha Primary School in Sebokeng, Vaal, to a university. This after the Gauteng government unveiled the school on Wednesday, 12 January. According to the Department of Infrastructure and Development, the refurbishment cost more than R95 million. Infrastructure and Development MEC Tasneem Motara officially handed over the school to Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. Pupils and staff, who returned for the new academic year, were present to witness the handover.  Motara said the future and education of the children is safe in Gauteng looking at all the investments the Gauteng department was putting towards education. The school has a library, two multi-purpose centres and two science laboratories. It also offers five Grade R classrooms and 26 foundation and intermediate classrooms. It has a nutritional centre, a play area and a hall which includes production-level sound and lighting. It also has a back-up generator that will help during load-shedding. There are also sanitiser stations at most corners of the school. Makhura and Lesufi cut the ribbon as they accepted the state-of-the-art school.  Panyaza welcomed all the pupils back and said this was their school and they should look after it. Makhura wished all young people in Gauteng a safe and productive year. Parent, mama Nomthandazo Shabalala, said: “Our kids will be playing if they fail. They have almost everything they need.” Another parent, Johannes Radebe, said: “When I look at it, I don’t see just a primary school, but a university.” “We will have a big challenge,” said a teacher. She said this is something that happens every year at the beginning of the first term. “They come late. They sleep in class and get hungry more often, it’s just a mess.” She said other terms were better because the kids didn’t stay long at home. “December holidays are the worst. They stay at home close to a month. That’s a long time. They learn bad habits.”
