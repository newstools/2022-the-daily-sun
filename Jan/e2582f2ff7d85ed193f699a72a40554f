friends and family of the late Patrick Shai gathered on Saturday, 29 January, to pay tribute to him. Many spoke of how passionate the veteran actor was about fighting gender-based violence (GBV). Fellow actor Sello Maake-KaNcube said Shai wanted to be an example of change. “Patrick was very passionate about fighting GBV and getting men to speak out about their issues. We would do it through the arts and through talks,” he said. Maake-kaNcube was the master of ceremonies at Shai’s funeral at the Soweto Theatre. “If you are a man in my age group, then one way or another you have abused somebody.” He said men in movements must stop being pretentious. Shai took his own life on 23 January at his home in Dobsonville, Soweto.

Society also asked, ‘Masechaba why are you staying?’” “It was because I didn’t want my children to be confused. I wanted them to belong and know who they were, in spite of who their father was,” she said. Masechaba said her husband didn’t care about acting and he was fired many times, but GBV was eating at him. “Let
is forgive because God forgive us all.”
