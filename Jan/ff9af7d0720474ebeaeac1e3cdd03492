SENIOR Independent Police Investigative Directorate investigator Judy Thwala says on the day Mthokozisi Ntumba was killed, officers didn’t record the incident in their pocket books. Thwala, testifying for the state in the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg on Tuesday, 25 December, said the commander of four cops accused of murder and attempted murder didn’t know about the incident on the day it happened. Tshephisho Kekana (27), Cidraas Motseothatha (43), Madimetja Legodi (37) and Victor Mohammed (51) of the public order police unit were shooting rubber bullets in Braamfontein, Joburg, on 10 March 2021 when Ntumba was hit and killed. Thwala said she asked for their pocket books from their commander and accused number one, two and three had not recorded the incident at all. However, she said accused number four had recorded details of the incident. “They drove a Nyala past De Beer Street where they fired rubber bullets at protesting students. He said he fired at the students with the intention to arrest them,” she said. Thwala said the information in the accused’s pocket book was identical to what was observed on CCTV footage of the incident. During cross examination, accused number one’s lawyer Thomas Mohope said his client reported the incident on Incident Registration Information System. However, Thwala insisted he had not recorded it anywhere. The matter continues on Wednesday, 26 January.
