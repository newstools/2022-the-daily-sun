A FAKE social media account has been giving reality star Mbali Mseleku, better known as MaNgwabe, a headache. Someone has started a Facebook page pretending to be the well-known polygamist Musa Mseleku’s wife and is scamming people of their hard-earned money. Speaking to Daily Sun, MaNgwabe said: “I don’t understand how people can be this heartless. I recently found out there’s a fake social media account after people came to my workplace and accused me of selling them a car that doesn’t exist. “This broke my heart and has affected me because it brings my name into disrepute. I am kindly pleading with people to stop doing this. “The general public should also stop handing over money so easily.” MaNgwabe told the SunTeam she tried to report the matter to the police several times. “I even went to the police and tried to lay a formal complaint because this has honestly got out of hand.

MaNgwabe said although the incident had left her shaken, she was accepting that challenges like this came with being in the public eye. “It will never sit well with me knowing that people are being scammed using my name. If there is someone who could assist me in putting an end to this, I would appreciate it,” she said. Their reality show, Uthando Nesthembu, has just wrapped up filming its latest season and MaNgwabe said viewers could expect it to be bigger and better.
