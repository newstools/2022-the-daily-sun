SOCCER coach Buddha Ndaba uses sport to build awareness against GBV and the killing of women. He teaches young men to stop abusive behaviour towards women and kids through soccer. “This way we will instil discipline in boys and stop silence in girls,” he said. Buddha (39) from Orange Farm, south of Joburg said the top eight tournament started during last year’s festive season in support of the 16 Days of Activism against GBV campaign. “The tournament ran on 27 and 28 December, and the winner received a full jersey kit. The plan is to run it annually, but it will run quarterly due to interest and support from our partners, Show Me Your Number and Ha-Chota Hardware. “This year, we’ll start during the Easter holidays. We’ll expand it to cater to under 13, 15, 17 and open division,” said the coach. He was a football player before he became a coach. “I was involved in a car accident at age 16. I spent three years recovering, but I could not reach my full fitness level to play any game,” said Buddha, who chose coaching at 21 to stay in football. He is popular with amateur football clubs, where he coached clubs such as Brazil, Silver Stars and Monaco. Today, he’s a full-time coach of Batsogile Football Club owned by Batsogile Community organisation, which hosts the sport challenge againstGBV and femicide tournaments. He said through sport, they will stop the culture of men who abuse women violently. The Batsogile Management Agency managing director also is a community leader.
