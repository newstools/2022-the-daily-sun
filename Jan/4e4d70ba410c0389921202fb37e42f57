VUYISEKA Cunukelo (18) has been dreaming of becoming a teacher since she was kid. She said it was her only hope of taking her family out of poverty. Like many other matrics, Vuyiseka is nervous about the results but remains positive. Vuyiseka lives with her mum and two younger siblings in a shack at her grandmother’s backyard. They rely on social grants to survive. Vuyiseka said she wasn’t able to have many things her peers had but she hasn’t given up. She told Daily Sun that she dreams of building her family a house one day and taking her siblings to better schools. She said studying has always been challenging but she knew how to make it work. “The shack doesn’t have enough space and my siblings often make noise. I waited for all of them to sleep before I could study. I got used to studying at night way before matric and it was much easier to do so even in matric. I’m no longer able to study during the day, I didn’t even stay late for extra classes at school because I was used to studying at night when it’s extremely quiet. However, maths and science were tricky. I consider myself smart but I’m scared at the moment,” she said. Vuyiseka did her matric at Thulani Secondary in Snake Park, Soweto. She said: “My love of teaching began when I was very little. I used to play a role of a teacher with my friends. I’d love to teach language to primary school children.” Vuyiseka has applied to two institutions and for a student financial aid.
