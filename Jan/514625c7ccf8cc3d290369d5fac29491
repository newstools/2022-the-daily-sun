Rasta has left Mzansi in stitches in a new TV advert. The artist, whose real name is Lebani Sirenje, is known for drawing bad portraits of celebrities after they die. In a new Chicken Licken advert, Rasta is seen applying for a job as a sketch artist with a police station commander. The station commander then starts imagining him drawing sketches that lead to the wrong people being arrested. Speaking to Daily Sun, Rasta said he was happy to be in the advert. “I enjoyed shooting it. It was an experience I will never forget.

When asked whether he was drawing bad portraits on purpose and was secretly a comedian, he denied it. “Although some people think I’m funny, I’m not a comedian,” he said. “People always want to know if I make bad portraits on purpose. My answer is no. I usually paint people who have passed on. There is no way I would sit in front of a grieving family and paint something wrongly on purpose. Most of the time, I am emotional when I paint.” Rasta said he hoped the advert would open doors for him to appear on TV more. “This advert will reveal the other side of me. I hope TV producers see that they can work with me,” he said.
