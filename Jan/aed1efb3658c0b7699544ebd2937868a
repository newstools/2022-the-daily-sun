INFORMAL traders in Cape Town won’t have to pay trading permit fees for the first six months of the year. This comes after their businesses have been battered by Covid-19. MMC for Urban Management Grant Twigg said informal traders will not be paying permit fees for the six months until the end of June. The city charges between R80 to R1 500 per month for an informal trading permit. Twigg said Covid-19 and the lockdown hit informal traders hard and the move will be a huge relief. Informal traders on the Grand Parade in the CBD said they were happy with the decision. “Things were hard. I felt as if I was working to pay the permit fees and take nothing home for my family,” said trader Nozuko Mthetheleli. “Lockdown ruined our businesses. We spend most of the time at our stands but people are not buying as they used to as many have lost their jobs.” Twigg said those who had paid their fees in advance will get a refund. “Covid-19 and its restrictions have harmed the informal trading sector in our country and globally. The economic fortunes of the informal trading sector directly depend on the daily retail footfall of customers for their earnings and their survival. Covid-19 and its accompanying restrictions drastically reduced the demand for products, especially from customers of the informal traders,” he said. Another informal trader who sells fruit and vegetables in Maitland said the relief will go a long way in easing the pressure. “I will know that the money I get will all go toward my kids’ school things. It was not easy to prepare for the reopening of schools as well as paying permit fees. “My permit costs R790 per month,” said Precious Madende (34).
