HOME Affairs has been making life hard for madala July Mkansi (74) and leaving him confused. His first and second born children Nhleko (22) and Runnel (19) were denied birth certificates, but his third and fourth kids Tiyani (17) and Sishiwe (8) were given birth certificates. Madala Mkansi from Makhuva Village outside Giyani in Limpopo said he couldn’t understand why his first two children were denied birth certificates while his other two kids were given the birth certificates. His wife Agnes Ngobeni (42) from Mozambique doesn’t have an ID. “I went to the Phalaborwa Home Affairs offices countless times to apply for the certificates but failed. They send me from pillar to post,” he told Daily Sun. Madala Mkansi said he was told to bring his kids’ clinic cards, his traditional leader’s letter and a letter from the schools. He said he produced all the documents but still did not get help. “Officials told my wife to go to Mozambique and come with proof that she did not marry in Mozambique. My wife came to South Africa when she was still a child and I’m a pensioner. I don’t have money to send her to Mozambique,” he said. “I have spent over R10 000 trying to get my kids’ birth certificates. People came to me claiming to help me, but only took my money and left.” He said he’s worried that if he dies without the birth certificates, the kids will suffer for the rest of their lives. Limpopo Home Affairs provincial manager Albert Matsaung said the matter has been followed up by the department. “The two kids who don’t have birth certificates will be subjected to registrations through late registration of birth processes where the father will lead the application process as he is a South African,” said Matsaung.
