CAPE Town firefighters were called to put out a fire spotted at University of Cape Town near the sports centre at the upper campus on Wednesday night at 11.30pm. University spokesman Elijah Moholola said it was spotted by the protection services, who then called firefighters. “The fire services department was on site in 15 minutes and the fire was declared fully doused by 1.45am on Thursday morning. UCT commends the patrol officers and fire services for acting swiftly. The fire was under control from when it was reported. After the fire was completely doused, overnight measures were put in place in the unlikely event of it re-igniting.” Maholola said no person or property was damaged. He said the university will also investigate the possible cause of the fire. “At this point, there is no indication of the cause of the fire. An investigation will follow and a formal report will be drafted and tabled.” UCT fire taking from the M3 looking towards the sports centre. Fire truck on the scene. #uctfire.

The UCT manager was on scene with a firefighting vehicle. The crew from Salt River returned to the scene this morning at 7.35am for an inspection and was informed that a cleaning crew appointed by UCT will make arrangements to remove these wood piles,” he said. There was no danger to any human life and the fire was very far from any buildings.
