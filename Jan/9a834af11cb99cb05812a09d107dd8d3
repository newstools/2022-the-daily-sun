Cape Town firefighters have managed to contain a vegetation fire that broke out on Saturday morning above Philip Kgosana Drive. According to Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson Jermaine Carelse, when the first crew from Salt River arrived, they informed the control centre that additional resources were required. The fire was next to the Hospital Bend inbound slipway onto Phillip Kgosana Drive, as well as the quarry behind Hudson Street. "Currently there are nine firefighting appliances and approximately 33 staff on scene, being assisted by [Nature Conservation Corporation and Working on Fire] crews," Carelse added. Carelse said the fire had been contained by 13:00 after two choppers water bombed the area for a short period. Phillip Kgosana Drive inbound was closed of at Hospital Bend. University of Cape Town spokesperson Nombuso Shabalala said they were aware of the fire, but that the fire department had told them that the wind was blowing away from the university campus.
