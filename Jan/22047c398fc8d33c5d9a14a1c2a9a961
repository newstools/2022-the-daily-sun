RISING star Young Stunna has a lot to be grateful for. The talented musician, whose song Adiwele became an instant hit last year after popular DJ Uncle Waffles was caught on camera dancing to it, took to social media to thank everyone who has supported him. According to the Bopha hit-maker, last year was the first time ever he has been fully booked in his career as well as the first time he received a paying gig. “2021 was a good year for me. My life changed in months. A lot of blessings came in flying. I couldn’t believe it. I’m still processing the whole thing because I couldn’t make time for that,” he said.
