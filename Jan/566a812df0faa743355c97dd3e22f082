Dear MizzB I have been dating my partner for three years and we have been sexually active. He cheated on me and ever since then I no longer find him sexually attractive.  I avoid having sex with him by all means as his presence just disgusts me. How do I make him pay for what he has put me through? ) Sista Dear Sista Cheating does leave a bitter taste on the tongue of the victim. It is normal to feel less attracted to your partner after he has cheated. Broken trust can bring up a lot of emotions and that includes anger. Revenge can never solve your problems or make you feel better. If you are unable to forgive your partner, then protect your inner peace by leaving the relationship. Do not allow your pain to turn you into a bitter person. All the best!
