Seven people were killed and two others injured when two bakkies collided on the R553 in Vanderbijlpark on Saturday morning. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said their paramedics and other emergency services arrived at the scene after 03:00 and found the two wrecked vehicles in the middle of the road. "On closer inspection, medics found the bodies of six men and a woman, aged between 14 and 30. The bodies were in the front and in the back of one of the vehicles. "Unfortunately, all seven patients had already succumbed to their injuries and were later declared dead. A male driver in the other bakkie and his passenger were assessed and found to have sustained serious injuries," Meiring said. The two were treated and transported to nearby hospitals for further care.
