PUMLA Qakana (43) had enough of seeing young girls peeing in an open space at a popular kasi joint on Spine Road. In an attempt to stop this problem, Pumla started a company called Sis Push Mobile Toilets. She hires mobile toilets every weekend and places them so people can relieve themselves. People buy booze and go to the eParkini area along Spine Road where they buy braai meat and drink in their parked cars. But when they are drunk, people, including young girls, pee at any open space they see. Pumla said she doesn’t go to eParkini or any other place for drinks, but she identified this problem while on her way to church. “The girls hid their faces but their naked butts are out in the open,” she said. “It takes away their dignity and they could even be robbed or raped there. She said many residents have thanked her because the place was stinking before she brought the mobile toilets. “I thought this has to come to an end because there’s no place for people to relieve themselves,” she said. She said even though she charges people R5 to use the toilets, she wants to make it less as some people can’t afford it. “For now I’m hiring but as soon as I buy my own toilets, I will reduce the price to R2 so that nobody will pee in the open space. Some people still pee behind it while some girls still go to the open space because they don’t have money to pay for toilets,” she said. The SunTeam saw many people using the open space to relieve themselves. “I don’t have money to pay for a toilet. I’ve been coming here for years and have used that open space,” said a girl who looked tipsy. Resident Hloniphile Poswa (43) said: “We see people peeing here every weekend. We stop our kids from playing here because it stinks.”
