SPORTS Minister Nathi Mthethwa has challenged clubs in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) to play a bigger role in helping to grow women’s football in the country. In an ideal world, Mthethwa would like to see every PSL club having their own women’s team as he believes this would go a long way in empowering the girl child and improving women’s club football in Mzansi. Mamelodi Sundowns and TS Galaxy remain the only two PSL teams with women teams, and this does not bode well for women’s football in the country, according to Mthethwa. This is another reason Mthethwa is fully behind the Confederation of African Football’s (Caf) directive that teams without a women’s team will not be allowed to participate in Caf competitions in the 2022-2023 season. “We want to see all the clubs in the PSL having professional women’s teams, just like you have on the men’s side,” said Mthethwa. “The Safa National League and the Hollywoodbets Super League were the beginning of women’s football development in the country. “We are confident that women’s football is on the up. We are calling on the private sector at the same time to come and support. “I want to single out Sasol and Hollywoodbets who have stuck out their necks and said ‘we are going to support women football.’ “We applaud these two brands for that, but we need more. Women in sport are not getting the support that they deserve, and we want to do everything to get that support for them. “We have spoken to the president of Safa Dr Danny Jordaan to say we will play our part to help people see value in women’s football.” Mthethwa was speaking at a Recognition of Excellence Awards Dinner in Sandton on Tuesday, where he handed over a R1 million cheque to the Sundowns Ladies team as a reward for winning the inaugural Caf Women’s Champions League. “It’s important that people are praised and rewarded when they do well for the country. This team has shown that the future of women’s football in our country is very bright,” added Mthethwa.
