"Many of the messages we received have said 'thank you for sharing him with the world' well, actually it is a two-way street because we shared him with the world and you shared part of the love you have for him with us and so we are thankful. We are thankful that many of you have gathered in your many places, in person or via the wonders of technology to be a part of celebrating daddy's life throughout this week," she said.
