AN eye for an eye! This is the wish of Welheminah Chabalala (55), whose son was brutally murdered on New Year’s Day. Welheminah said she still struggles to sleep peacefully after she saw the badly burnt body of her son, Jika, who was stabbed before he was set alight. The 35-year-old was allegedly killed by his friend at Greenfield near Kanana in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, after an argument. Speaking to Daily Sun, Welheminah said those who witnessed the murder said the killer had an argument with her son before stabbing him and dragging him to his place where he set him alight. “On 1 January, two people came to my house at about 9pm and told me to come with them. They said there was a problem with my son. When we got to the scene, people had already gathered including the police and firemen. Unfortunately, my son had already died. I asked to see him before he could be taken to the mortuary and I couldn’t believe what I saw. He was stabbed in the neck and was badly burnt,” she said. Welheminah said the pain she was feeling was unbearable. “This monster shouldn’t have killed my son the way he did. It’s clear he wanted him dead. The police must arrest this man. He deserves to die the same way my son did so that he feels the pain,” she said. Welheminah said her son was a good person who always helped out whenever he was asked. “He didn’t deserve to die the way he did,” she said. Jika’s uncle, Johannes Hlongwane (46), said what happened to his nephew was unforgivable. “We know people get killed, but the manner in which my nephew died really traumatised us,” he said. Sergeant Herman Moremi of Temba Police Station said the police were investigating a case of murder. “The suspect stabbed the deceased to death before setting the shack alight. No arrest has been made as the suspect is still on the run,” said Moremi.
