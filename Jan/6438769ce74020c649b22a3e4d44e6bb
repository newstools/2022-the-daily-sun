FIREFIGHTERS are battling flames at Parliament in Cape Town. There is still smoke coming from the top of the new wing of the National Assembly. Minister of Public Works Patricia De Lille said they are still establishing the cause of the fire. The City of Cape Town’s MMC of Community Safety Jean-Pierre Smith said they received the news of the fire around 5:03am. “Roeland Street Fire was first on scene and with the assessment of the fire more resources were called. We currently have six firefighting appliances and approximately 36 firefighters on scene,” he said. He added that Sea Point, Salt River, Brooklyn, Goodwood and Milnerton firefighting crews joined the Roeland Street crew. “We have two fire safety officers at the scene as well. The fire is currently on the third floor. Initial reports indicate it started in the office space and is spreading toward the gymnasium. The roof area has caught alight and the National Assembly building is on fire too,” said Smith.  Smith said the fire is still raging. “The fire has not been contained and reports of cracks in some walls of the building have been confirmed,” said Smith. ANC Member of Parliament Faiez Jacobs said the developments are interesting because the place is a national key point. “We are obviously alarmed, we can’t speculate it is bizarre that our Parliament, a key point, is in flames. We are concerned but everything is under control because our ministers are here but it is concerning that something like this happened at a national key point,” said Jacobs.
