FIVE more people were killed in an incident that may be related to copper theft on Wednesday, 19 January. Their bodies were found lying at the side of the busy Golden Highway near Eldorado Park, Joburg. Ten people have been killed in the area in the past two weeks. The five killed yesterday were allegedly stealing copper cables. According to residents from the nearby squatter camp, they were shot by private security guards. Meanwhile last week, five security guards at the Pikitup depot in the area were killed by unknown men in blankets and balaclavas. It was still not clear if the shootings were linked. Residents told Daily Sun that they were living in fear as copper thieves often ran into their area when there were gunshots. “It started on Sunday. They came and started digging. There were gunshots and they ran away. On Monday, two men were shot and injured. Thieves also ran away.” Another resident said people who lived in the landfill site were responsible for many crimes. Colonel Dimakatso Sello said: “Police are investigating cases of murder after five bodies were found with gunshot wounds. The circumstances surrounding the incident are unknown as investigations continue,” she said. “Cops request anyone with information to go to their nearest station.” When asked if cops knew about the security guards who were allegedly behind the shooting, Sello said: “That has not been established.” Pikitup’s Bukelwa Njingolo said their truck drivers were sometimes terrorised by those who had taken over the landfill. He said fences around the area were broken, making it easy for people to move around.
