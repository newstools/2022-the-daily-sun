SPRINGBOK captain Siya Kolisi says it was “scary” for him to be joining the Sharks from Stormers last year. Kolisi was worried he wouldn’t adjust to life in Durban after 11 years with Stormers, and that he would not be on top of his game which could have resulted in him not making the Bok squad. However, that wasn’t the case. Kolisi played all 13 Boks matches last year. He was only the third player to do so alongside lock Eben Etzebeth and centre Lukhanyo Am, who is Kolisi’s captain at the Sharks. But Kolisi was the only player to start every Test match. The loose forward was named last Thursday as the SA Rugby Union’s Player of the Year, beating Am, Etzebeth, Damian de Allende and Makazole Mapimpi. But it was an incredible comeback by Kolisi, who had an injury ravaged 2020 season with a knee injury. However, Kolisi said that moving to the Sharks was scary at first but spending eight weeks in the pre-season was a saving grace. “The change was very scary because I was at the Stormers for 11 years,” said Kolisi. “Whenever you go to a new place, you have to prove yourself. I knew I wasn’t close to where I was supposed to be. I was even scared of not making the Springbok team. “I didn’t think I was fit enough. Then I had that eight-week pre-season. Coming back and playing again, it took a while and I got back to the Springbok camp as well. “The standards and the goals that coach Jacques Nienaber and coach Rassie Erasmus (now Saru director) set and obviously the conditioning helped when I got there. “But I had a good base, so it did help me a lot. When I came to Durban, it really did help me because I went for eight weeks playing no rugby at all. I was just training and that helped me so much.”
