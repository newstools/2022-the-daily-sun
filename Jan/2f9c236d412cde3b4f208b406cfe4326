MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp has described it as “pity” that his side were drawn against SuperSport United in the Nedbank Cup last-32. The draw means the Team of Choice will face the three-time Ke Yona Cup winners twice in the space of seven days. The two sides will resume their DStv Premiership campaign on 15 February at Harry Gwala Stadium. Middendorp is having lean spells as United coach, with his club having not won a game since beating TS Galaxy via an own-goal last October. Since then, Maritzburg have gone 10 league matches without a win, which has put pressure on the future of the former Kaizer Chiefs coach. But Maritzburg management last week told SunSport they have decided to stick with Middendorp, as they believe he can turn things around. The 53-year-old’s saving grace for Middendorp is that these matches against SuperSport will be played at his backyard in Pietermaritzburg. “It is a pity to play a team like SuperSport which is our first opponent after the break and again five or six days later,” said Middendorp who lost the Nedbank Cup in 2019 as the Chiefs coach. “For us we know we have to be at our best playing against a team like SuperSport, a high quality team that is good and that is what we are preparing for.” Maritzburg, who lost in the Ke Yona Cup final in 2018 to Free State Stars, were dumped out of the competition last season by Orlando Pirates in the last-16.
