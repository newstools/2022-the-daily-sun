NELISIWE Mahlangu has been living with extreme pain since 2020. The 36-year-old from Weltevrede, outside Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga, has a wound that won’t heal. Numerous visits to doctors have not helped her. Nelisiwe told Daily Sun the problem started in 2009 when she experienced pain in her right leg. She went to the clinic and was transferred to the hospital. They gave her treatment, which eased the pain for years. In 2020, her legs became swollen and developed sores. She went back to the hospital, but none of the pain relief methods she was offered helped. Nelisiwe said she had visited traditional and western doctors with no success. She said her leg had started smelling and she was forced to send her three children to live with relatives. Nelisiwe said at first, doctors suspected she had diabetes but tests for the condition were negative. “I am living in pain and the odour is very unpleasant. I am appealing for help so I can get my life back. “What pains me most is that I cannot be with my kids and family. I need help.” Nelisiwe said she had to stop working and couldn’t go anywhere because of the terrible smell. “I can’t go anywhere and my leg is getting worse,” she said. Nelisiwe said she was willing to have her leg amputated if it meant she could have her normal life back. Dr Zuko Booi said there could be different diseases behind the condition. He said generally, cleaning the wound or amputation were options. “There is what we call dry gangrene and if it has any infection it will be amputated because it’s an emergency. The best thing for her to do is go back to doctors to review her and see what is happening,” he said.
