Gin started rising in popularity in Mzansi from 2019 and has since become the second most popular liquor category in the country, overtaking vodka. Just like wine, this popular drink can reach new heights when served with certain dishes to bring out the best in its taste. It’s important to note that pairing spirits and food is a little complicated than putting cheese and wine side-by-side. So, you will need to use something that the gin has in it, that’s the golden rule of gin-pairing. Here are 5 foods that you can pair with Gin: 1. Lamb Curry. Spicy food and refreshing botanicals go great together. 2. Seafood. Seafood and Gin go well together because of the flavour prominent component in gin is a delicate briny, almost salty note, reminiscent of seafood and shellfish. 3. Fried foods. Spicy fried foods need something crisp and cool to refresh the palate and Gin does just that very well. 4. Cheese Gin and cheese are a match made in heaven when cheese is chosen well with the flavours in the Gin. 5. Dessert Gin pairs greatly with white, milk or dark chocolate.
