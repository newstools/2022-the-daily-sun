BAFANA Bafana legend Katlego “Killer” Mphela has predicted a bright future for Baroka youngster Evidence “Tower” Makgopa. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns striker said he has been impressed by the 21-year-old at Baroka and at Bafana. But Mphela believes Makgopa still needs to improve some tactical aspects of his game. “I like the boy and he can be one of the best strikers in the country,” said Mphela, who has retired after 14 years in the game. “I watched him when playing for Bafana in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers and I was impressed. “But he needs to work on his finishing at training. When (Baroka) are done training for the day, he needs to stay behind with the goalkeeper or teammates who are willing to help him. I used to do that all the time after training.” The Ga-Mampa born star is in his second season in the DStv Premiership. And his impressive talent has won him the trust of Bafana coach Hugo Broos. Makgopa has four caps for Bafana and three goals. Last year, Makgopa was part of the South African Under-23 squad that played in the Tokyo Olympics Games, scoring one goal. This season, Makgopa has netted only two goals in 15 league matches. “It is not easy to score goals all the time as a striker,” said Mphela. “Makgopa is still young and he is developing well. He just needs to work hard and keep positioning himself well and the goals will come. He must never lose confidence. Even the best strikers in the world struggle for goals sometimes.” The 37-year-old played 53 times for Bafana and scored 23 goals. Mphela is the third Bafana leading goal scorer behind Benni McCarthy (31) and Shaun Bartlett (28). Mphela also had a stint with the French clubs Strasbourg and Reims, between 2004 and 2006.
