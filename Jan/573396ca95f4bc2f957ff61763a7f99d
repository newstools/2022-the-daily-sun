A MAN (35) was bust with nyaope, dagga, crystal meth, cash and a Metro cops’ reflector jacket. He was bust during an operation by police, the community safety team and Traditional Forum members in Pankop in Mmametlhake, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday, 19 January. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said police received information about a suspect allegedly dealing in drugs around the Pankop area. “A search and seizure operation was subsequently executed on the premises and dagga, nyaope, counterfeit cigarettes, a Metro police reflector jacket and cash were found hidden inside the wardrobe and storeroom. A 35-year-old suspect was immediately arrested. “The police confiscated 940 pinches of nyaope wrapped in brown plastic, 10 crystal rocks in clear plastic bags, crystal meth in nine clear plastic bags, seven 20s pacific blue counterfeit cigarettes, a yellow and orange Metro police reflector jacket, 40x40 reclosable bags, one half box reclosable bags, and cash. The drugs were confiscated for further investigation. The suspect will appear before the Mbibana Magistrates Court soon,” said Mohlala. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela appreciated that the community participated in policing their own area. “This is what I always preach, that the community can assist the police in their respective areas. This is the only way we can win the fight against crime. Drugs are killing our children and we must fight that,” she said.
