MAKHOSI Shelembe has left Mzansi Magic reality show Mnakwethu. Her husband Bheki Langa told Daily Sun her family advised her to pull out of the show due to their conflict. “Their intention is to separate us. I don’t know why they’re doing this because we still love each other and most importantly, we have a child together,” he said. “MaShelembe also runs a tavern to take care of herself and the baby. "I’m helping her to run it but right now, she’s struggling financially because we are having problems.” Bheki said he built a house for his wives but MaShelembe didn’t want to go home. “I’ve always said she has too many advisers. I’m getting tired of her trying to please everyone. If she doesn’t want me, she can go,” he said. “I promised the TV show that me and my wives, MaShelembe and MaSithole, would do all the seasons. My wives agreed but MaShelembe’s family blocked her.
