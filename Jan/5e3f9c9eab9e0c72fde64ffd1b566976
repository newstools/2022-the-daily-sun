THE
much-anticipated Volvo XC40 P8 Recharge has been spotted on Mzansi roads,
marking the arrival of the Swedish automaker’s first all-electric car in the
country. As soon as
Volvo opened the order books for the battery-powered XC40 last May, all initial
slots were sold out. The first
example was handed over to its delighted new owner at the Tom Campher Volvo
Cars dealership in Auckland Park, Joburg. In order to
meet growing local demand, Volvo Car South Africa has secured an additional
allocation of units, with orders now being taken and deliveries expected in
June. The XC40 P8
Recharge, that sits at the summit of the popular XC40 range and is priced at
R1,2 million, is sold exclusively online via the automaker’s innovative My
Volvo website. Volvo’s managing
director Greg Maruszewski said the purchase of the first pure electric model
came with additional benefits.  “The XC40
P8 Recharge ships standard with the Volvo care package. Not only does it
include a five-year maintenance plan and warranty, with the battery pack
covered for eight years or 160 000km, but also three years of comprehensive
insurance, use of a petrol-powered vehicle for a two-week holiday every year
for three years, a home charging wall box as well as all the requisite charge
cables,” said Maruszewski. Volvo said
the electric compact SUV was able to travel up to 418km on a single charge,
with 80% of its battery capacity refilled in just 40 minutes when using a fast
charger. Fitted with
twin electric motors and a 78kWh battery pack, the XC40 P8 Recharge boasts high
peak outputs of 304kW and 660Nm. With power
directed to all four wheels, the Recharge is capable of seeing off the required
0-100km/h sprint in 4,9 seconds. The automaker’s
first EV has standard safety equipment, including various driver assistance
features, and shares its five-star Euro New Car Assessment Programme rating
with its combustion-engined siblings.
