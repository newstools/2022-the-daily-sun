TO strengthen their squad to fight relegation, in the second round of the DStv Premiership, Maritzburg United have roped in five new players, including Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Lucky Baloyi. The Team of Choice confirmed the signings of Tawanda Macheke, Genino Palace, Baloyi, Steven Pereira and Friday Samu. Zimbabwean forward Macheke was previously with Black Rhinos in his homeland, and he is joined by another striker in Zambian Samu, who was played for Green Buffaloes. South African attacking midfielder Palace has spent some time in Portugal and was last with Académica De Coimbra, while Cape Verde international right-back Pereira was in the same country at UD Oliveirense, but has also played in the Netherlands and Bulgaria. Finally, former Kaizer Chiefs and Bloemfontein Celtic midfielder Baloyi will add some steel to the centre of the park. "I am so excited to have joined Maritzburg United and everyone at the club have been so welcoming and supportive towards me ever since I arrived," Baloyi says. "I'll do my best to contribute to the team and help us achieve our goals for the remainder of the season. I am looking forward to using this opportunity to help the club in any possible way. It feels great to be here." The quintet will be a line to make their debuts when Maritzburg host SuperSport United in the Nedbank Cup early next month.
