Stellenbosch FC have joined the other DStv Premiership sides in the transfer window. Teams have been busy in the market enforcing their squads for the second round of the campaign. Stellenbosch on Friday announced the signing of Venezuelan forward Juan Carlos Ortiz. Ortiz become a second South American attacking player in the Stellies team. He joins Argentine Junior Mendieta at the club as coach Steve Barker looks to add some additional attacking flair to a team that has pace and youthful energy, but not always the desired quality in the box. The 28-year-old netted an impressive 16 goals in 32 games for former club Monagas in the Venezuelan top-flight in the 2021 season, which proved a breakthrough year for him as he won a move to the DStv Premiership. Stellies have also brought in defensive midfielder Sibongiseni Mthethwa from Black Leopards. The 27-year-old played 25 top-flight games for Lidoda Duvha last season, and continued to be an important player after their relegation.
