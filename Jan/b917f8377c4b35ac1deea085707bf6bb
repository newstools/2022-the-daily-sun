THE Cape Town disaster risk management department and fire and rescue services have kicked off a public education and awareness campaign. This after squatter camp fires increased in the last few months. MMC for safety and security Jean-Pierre Smith said from 1 November to 3 January, firefighters responded to 531 fires in squatter camps compared to 485 for the same period last year. The department visited the area on Friday, 22 January. Smith said: “Every fire is devastating, no matter the extent of the property damage, more so when lives and livelihoods are lost. Some communities are more vulnerable than others.” The campaign will not only educate communities in high-risk areas on the causes of fires, but will also improve their awareness and preparedness for fires. The campaign kicked off in October and so far has reached about 15 000 households in squatter camps in Gugulethu, Bloekombos, Khayelitsha, Mfuleni, Nyanga, Kuils River, Driftsands and Wallacedene. Said Smith: “We have planned interventions for the next few weeks that will reach the 20 top high-risk squatter camps, and the education and awareness will be done door-to-door. “But our staff will also visit day hospitals, clinics, libraries and do poster drop-offs at schools, public transport interchanges, and other community hubs.” MMC for human settlements Malusi Booi said residents who need subsidised housing could register with the city’s housing needs register. “This is vital because an objective tool is required to allocate space amid the immense need for housing. “Without registering on the city’s housing needs register, it is not possible to be considered for an opportunity,” said Booi. Resident Namhla Somhlahlo (45) said sometimes fires just happened, even though they were careful.
