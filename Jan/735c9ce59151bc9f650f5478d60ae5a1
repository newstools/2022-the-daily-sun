IVORY Coast booked their place in the knockout stage of the Africa Nations Cup (Afcon) following a 3-1 win over defending champions Algeria at a newly built Japoma Stadium in Douala last night. The Elephants’ Franck Kessie broke the stalemate in the 23rd minutes with an easy tap-in while Ibrahim Sangare put matters beyond Algeria’s reach with a stunning header in the 40th minute to break the hearts of their fans. Arsenal striker, Nicolas Pepe, rubbed more salt into their wounds when he grabbed the third goal in the 55th minute to give Ivorian fans a sweet revenge after being booted out in the quarter-finals by Algeria on their way to win the trophy in 2019. The defeat ended Algeria’s hopes of advancing further in the competition, as they packed their bags to return home after they finished bottom of Group E with just one point. This is the second time that Algeria failed to get past the group stages in their history after winning the Afcon title having failed to go through to the next round in the 1992 edition after winning the trophy in 1990. They also failed to win a single match in this competition following a goalless draw with Sierra Lione and a shocking 1-0 defeat to Equatorial Guinea. They managed to score just one goal in the competition via the boot of Sofiane Bendebka in the 74th minutes to console fans. Algerian captain Riyad Mahrez was the main culprit as he missed a penalty in the 60th minute that could have helped turn their fortunes around. Ivory Coast will go through to the knockout phase after they finished on top of Group E on seven points. They will be joined by Equatorial Guinea who finished second on six points following a 1-0 win over Sierra Lione in another match played in Limbe. Leone Stars were also eliminated.
