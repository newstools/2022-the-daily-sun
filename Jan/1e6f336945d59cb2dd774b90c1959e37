FUNEKA Danca was left shocked after she learnt she had been given idliso, a love potion. The star of reality show Mnakwethu said her husband confessed to her that he had used the potion on her. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “I am shocked that he gave me idliso but I also don’t believe it. We have been married for more than 12 years and I never suspected anything.” Funeka said she had no intention of consulting with traditional healers because she did not believe in them. “If the idliso was inside me, I would have known and probably done something about it. My husband has also asked me not to consult with a traditional healer as he is one himself,” she said. ALSO READ : CASSPER NYOVEST TARGETED BY SCAMMERS! Funeka said she had no problem with her husband taking Philile Vilakazi as a second wife. This comes after her husband Mzokhona Mbeje also confessed to giving Philile a love potion on the latest episode of the show. “For the past two or three years, she was under my spell,” he said. Mzokhona said the first time he gave Funeka a love potion was just after they got married. “I gave her again when I was preparing to take another wife because I wanted them to love and respect each other. It worked because they never fought and they were always happy together,” he said. Sangoma, Gogo Mkhize said if Funeka was given a love potion, she would not know and she would think everything was normal. “She also has nothing to worry about because it means her ancestors have no problem with it. Culturally, this is accepted, especially in polygamous marriages. However, the right procedure must be followed,” he said.
