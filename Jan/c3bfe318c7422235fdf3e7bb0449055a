DURING the recent heavy rain, dams filled up and now parents are worried their kids will drown. Residents of Empumelelweni, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun they wanted the municipality to fence in local dams as kids were still on rotational learning and they weren’t always home during the day. Maseven Masombuka (48) said he constantly had to chase kids swimming in his local dam away. “Danger is looming as the dam is open and full of water. It’s hot now and the kids come here to cool themselves off,” he said. “I sometimes go to check that they’re not swimming. Many parents are at work during the week and come back very late. “As residents, we are requesting that the municipality put up a fence before something bad happens. We don’t want to cry over something that could have been avoided.” Palesa Masemola (53) said two kids were murdered and thrown into the dam in 2021 and it would make sense to restrict access. “The hot temperatures drive the kids to go and swim at the dam. We are not always at home and our kids do as they please,” she said. “For the safety of the kids, we are asking for a fence to be put up around the dam. In 2021, two kids disappeared and we looked for them everywhere until we found them in the dam.” Thembisile Hani Municipality spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane-Mokako said there were no plans to fence dams at present. “Our budget is not enough to do everything at once. In the future, we will consider it if the budget permits. For now, we ask parents to teach their kids about the danger of swimming in dams,” she said.
