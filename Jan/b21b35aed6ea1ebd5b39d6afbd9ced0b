THE rising numbers of trauma fatality cases during the festive season is putting a lot of pressure on the forensic pathology services in Limpopo. Since the Christmas weekend, 123 bodies have been collected with the trauma fatalities cases piling up due to car crashes, gunshots and stab wounds. The Limpopo Department of Forensic Pathology recorded 4 459 trauma cases during 2020, but the number rose to 5 091 after 14 December. The Capricorn District has had the most cases with 1 964 followed by Vhembe at 937, Waterberg with 785, Mopani at 784 and Sekhukhune at 621. Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said most of the fatalities are as a result of being under the influence of alcohol. “Our forensic pathologists are very busy on our roads, our homes, taverns and state mortuaries. “Pietersburg Hospital Forensic Pathology Services Unit has admitted 27 trauma cases for post mortem in just two days,” she said. Ramathuba said families will soon start complaining because of delays of post mortem results as they were under pressure to bury their loved ones. “We are battling with Covid-19 where many of our healthcare workers have tested positive and according to protocol, they are in isolation leaving only a few of them to man different sections of our hospitals,” said Ramathuba. She said they understood that during the festive period many people were travelling. “We want to caution them to be vigilant on the roads, drink responsibly and to be patient with each other. “Our pathology team is trying their level best to execute their daily responsibilities, but they need our support to act responsibly and avoid trauma cases,” Ramathuba said.
