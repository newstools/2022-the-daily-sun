Community Policing Forums should be extra vigilant when fighting crime during the festive season. Crime increases during this time of the year. I’m concerned about the high number of robberies in some areas. The festive holidays are almost complete but criminals don’t go on holiday. South Africa is always faced with a high crime rate during this time. In the case of house burglaries, the opportunity is greater when people are away on holiday. House robberies are also more likely to occur over the summer holidays when people spend more time outside with their doors open.
