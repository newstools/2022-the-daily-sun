UNLIKE the rest of the country, thugs don’t go on holiday. On New Year’s Eve, popular Eastern Cape house DJ Bukiwe Zide found this out the hard way when a hijacking gang targeted her. Luckily, DJ Zeed, as her fans affectionately call her, lived to tell the tale and still has her car. Sharing her terrifying experience on Facebook, she wrote: “I almost got hijacked in Cape Road, guys. Yhoo!!” The DJ, who is also a newsreader on Umhlobo Wenene FM, said she was driving in Gqeberha minding her own business when three thugs in an unmarked silver grey vehicle appeared out of nowhere and tried to hijack her when she stopped at a traffic light.
