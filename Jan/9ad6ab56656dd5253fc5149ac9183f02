THE bail application of Zandile Christmas Mafe, who is accused of burning Parliament, has been moved to next week after he contracted Covid-19. National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said Mafe was in isolation and his lawyers could not consult with him, hence the date being moved to 29 January. He said on Tuesday, the court was advised that Mafe was in isolation. On the day, Western Cape High Court Judge president John Hlophe had ordered him from Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital following a successful review procedure by his defence. His lawyer advocate Dali Mpofu had argued that the 30-day mental evaluation referral was unlawful, an argument that Hlophe agreed with. During the proceedings, it was revealed that the evaluation was not in compliance with the law since it was done for less than the minimum 72 hours required. Then on Wednesday, Mafe was released and remanded at Pollsmoor Prison, where he was isolating. Ntabazalila added that a new charge sheet had been provided to the defence. “The accused is now charged with housebreaking with intent to commit terrorism and arson, arson, terrorism and theft. The changes came after Advocate Mervyn Menigo, who is the leading prosecutor in the matter, studied the docket afresh. Menigo further consulted with the investigating officer, and felt that the charges needed to be reformulated,” said Ntabazalila.
