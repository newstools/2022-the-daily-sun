MADALA Boleka Tonyela says thugs are taking advantage of him after his 28 goats and sheep were stolen over a period of two years. The 70-year-old from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni said he wanted to teach the thugs a lesson. “I want them to stay away from my livestock next time, knowing this is not their playground,” he said. Madala said earlier this month, he went to visit relatives and when he returned, he found 13 animals missing, including seven goats and five sheep. “What makes me angry is the sheep did not belong to me. My friend asked me to keep them for him.” Madala said in 2020, thugs cleaned out his kraal, taking all 15 of his goats. He saved up to buy more, only for them to be stolen as well. “I don’t want to go to police because they are going to open a case which will gather dust. I will deal with the thieves in my own way. I want the animals to cry in their stomachs. “I want them to get severe diarrhoea if they eat the meat,” he said. Madala said he was going to a sangoma to make sure the thieves suffered. His friend Thabo Molapo, whose sheep were stolen, said many people didn’t keep livestock in kraals, as they were stolen. “Madala erected a kraal in his yard to keep his seven goats and I asked him to keep my sheep while erected my own. We feel broken for losing the animals.”
