GOSPEL star Thinah Zungu and DJ Hlo’s managers are at each other’s throats. The trouble started when Themba Mthembu, Thinah’s manager, accused DJ Hlo’s management of being disorganised on Facebook. Mthembu said calling a media briefing to speak about DJ Hlo instead of putting out a press release was not professional. He said DJ Hlo needed better management because although people loved her, they were killing her brand and hogging the spotlight for themselves. DJ Hlo, whose real name is Hlosiwe Mthalane (24), held a media briefing on Wednesday, 5 December to talk about unexpectedly winning Ukhozi FM’s Song of the Year competition. Themba said he didn’t want to fight but DJ Hlo’s managers should have issued a press release.

Let her prove herself with her craft,” he said. “She is managed by people who are also looking for the spotlight. She is not going to get anywhere with her current management.” DJ Hlo’s manager Sindy Xaba responded with guns blazing, accusing Themba of using her to get popular. “This is disgusting coming from an artist’s manager. I’m very disappointed that he is looking for popularity with DJ Hlo,” she said. “He knows the difficulties of building a brand. He crated Thinah’s Zungu brand and was criticised but continued. I pushed DJ Hlo from being an unknown to where we are now. He must not start unnecessary hate. He must keep his opinion to himself.” Many people were left surprised when DJ Hlo’s song Isibani won the Ukhozi FM prize as she was not very well known and people questioned who voted for her.
