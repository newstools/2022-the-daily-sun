AS pastor of the Gabola Church, Elijah Maleka used to go door-to-door to pray for people, but now he’s the one who needs prayers. In July, the 48-year-old from Seshego zone 8 outside Polokwane in Limpopo suffered a mild stroke, affecting the right side of his body. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said he was getting better when he suddenly became blind. He said he was struggling as he lived alone. “I cannot do anything on my own as I’m blind. I now rely on neighbours and relatives for food and to take care of me. My life has just turned into a mess,” he said. Elijah believed he had been cursed, and bad luck was following him.

As I was still recovering at home, a stroke struck me. I haven’t been to work since January 2021,” he said. “I have been to hospital several times. I got medication, but it doesn’t seem to work because my situation is not improving.” He said he needed prayers for his eyesight to come back so he could go back to work and provide for his family. “It’s not easy to cope when you become disabled along the way. It’s difficult to adjust. I miss praying for people and engaging with them,” he said. Elijah said he needed a volunteer to take him to FH Odendaal Hospital’s eye clinic in Modimolle. “I need a volunteer as I’m not fit to drive. I will do everything in my power to see again,” he said. Maleka’s wife Judith (54) said she worked in Dennilton and couldn’t be with him all the time. “He needs special care because he has high blood pressure and diabetes as well. We really need help,” she said.
