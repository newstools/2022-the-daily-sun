A father will not rest until he gets justice for his eight-year-old daughter who was raped allegedly by his cousin (39). The furious father told Daily Sun he hoped cops would find the suspect before he did. The 41-year-old from Braamfischerville in Soweto said it happened last week while he was at work. He said he left his daughter with her gogo and the cousin went to check up on them. He said the gogo wasn’t well so she was in her bedroom most of the time. “My daughter told me gogo was asleep and her uncle started by asking her to show him her punani. I’m disgusted even talking about this. From there, he raped her and fled to KZN.” The father said his aunt from KZN called him to ask if everything was okay as the cousin arrived home looking nervous and scared as if something bad had happened. “I called my mum (the little girl’s gogo) to check if everything was okay, but she was asleep and my daughter answered. She was crying and couldn’t talk when I asked if anything was wrong,” he said. When the father rushed home, he noticed blood on his daughter’s legs. “With hesitation, she told me what happened. When I called my aunt to ask where my cousin was, she told me he drank water, stayed for a few minutes and left.” He said they reported the matter to the cops before heading to the hospital. “I can’t describe the anger and hurt I’m experiencing. Police are still looking for him and I really hope they find him before I do because I won’t go easy on him. My daughter is scarred for life,” said the angry father. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a case of rape was opened and was under investigation. He said cops had a lead of where the cousin might be and were doing everything in their power to find him.
