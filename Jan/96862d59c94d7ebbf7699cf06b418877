The SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) is forging ahead with its plans to get the fans back to the stadiums. The national Olympic movement is pushing for 50% vaccinated fans to return to the stadiums as soon as possible. Sascoc president Barry Hendricks told SunSport that the task team made up of specialists will meet with Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa on Tuesday to put their recommendations forward. “The task team will meet this week and they will brief and advise the minister and make some recommendations to him on Tuesday,” said Hendricks. “The minister will take their recommendations to the Cabinet. We are prioritising the return of the fans.” While Hendricks admitted that Covid-19 is still an issue, he is encouraged that other sporting codes are back in action. “We want to fight for the fans, but they have to be vaccinated to be able to return to the stadiums. We have medical doctors from Safa, SA rugby, Sascoc board members, and other specialists dealing with the issue.“The plan is clear we have to return to the stadium and boost the economy.” Hendricks said he would love to see the fans back in the Premier Soccer League and Super Rugby matches soon. He highlighted events such as the Comrades Marathon, Two Oceans, and Soweto Marathon that suffered financial losses because they could not take place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “It pains me to see a full capacity in the English Premiership and other sporting codes in the world while we cannot even manage to get 50% spectators in our country. You have to feel for the running events that could not happen due to Covid-19. “We’ll help the minister persuade Cabinet to open up the sport again. We’re working hard to come up with a plan to ensure the safety of fans at the various sporting venues,” added Hendricks.
