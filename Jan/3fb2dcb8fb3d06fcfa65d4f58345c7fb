THE Coronavirus has put almost everything on hold. And, the entertainment industry was also hit hard by lockdown regulations that were aimed at preventing the spread of the virus as many shows were cancelled. Now as the regulations have been lifted, shows like Ugu Jazz Festival has announced its comeback. The festival, held annually at Ugu Sports and Leisure in KZN South Coast, usually attracts fans of genres such as Afro-soul, jazz and maskandi, among others. It was last held in 2019 before Covid-19 hit our shores. Organiser and Eyadini Lounge owner Jabulani “Mjay” Nzama has revealed that the show will take place in June. “We are busy organising it, and pray that Covid-19 does not disturb our plans. When the lockdown was lifted and infections declining, we were excited. So, we decided to host the show again,” he said. He added that for now, the organising team was targeting the number of people who, according to regulations, were allowed to gather outdoors. “But if the numbers change, we will go back to the drawing board. We want everyone to be safe, and will ensure that we don’t allow those without masks to enter. We will give more information at a later stage,” Mjay said. Though the line-up of artists to perform has not yet been announced, the last festival saw musicians such as Judith Sephuma and Lira as well as popular groups such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Mafikizolo on stage.
