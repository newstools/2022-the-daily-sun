SIVUYILE Sophi was heartbroken after losing his cash to a scammer pretending to be businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize. The 36-year-old from Matatiele, Eastern Cape, said he was desperate for money, so he approached Shauwn on Facebook. “I asked her to teach me about trading. My intention was to make a lot of money. This person promised to make me R15 000 in three hours if I paid them R5 000. I didn’t have R5 000 but unfortunately, I invested my last R1 000. “I was broke and had a family to take care of. My desperation was coupled with the fact that I had not worked since lockdown. In December, I was lucky and found a piece job. “I saved R1 000 and I was planning to buy stationery and school uniforms in January. I kept searching for other ways to make money.” Sivuyile said he deposited the money into the scammer’s bank account.

By that time, I had deposited R1 000 and she promised me R5 200 within three hours. “I asked her to refund my money, but she started telling me stories. I insisted, but she blocked me.” Sivuyile said he was still convinced he was speaking to Shauwn. “I still believe I was scammed by her because she correctly updated her status and photos on Facebook.” Speaking through her personal assistant Qhawe Holomo, Shauwn said she didn’t have a Facebook account. “Shauwn does not have a Facebook account but a verified Instagram account. “She’s done everything to warn people about these fake accounts. She’s explained she doesn’t do trading. It’s sad to see people scammed in her name.”
