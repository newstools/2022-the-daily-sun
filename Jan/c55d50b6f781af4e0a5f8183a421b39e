AFTER realising most maskandi artists sang the same tune, Thokozani Ngema decided to take on the genre with a new style. Dubbed Igcokama Langempela, Thokozani calls his singing style Ushuni Westayela. He said this style was bringing a fresh take to maskandi. “I saw a gap and I used the opportunity to fill it. My style is unique and no one can imitate it,” said Thokozani. The 33-year-old from Mondlo, northern KZN, recently released three singles titled Umfana WePolo, Ngolovane and Amaperepere. He said the songs surprised him as they were received warmly by maskandi fans. “I’m humbled by the positive response. My songs are played by different radio stations. I get messages of support from fans. Truly, my tune is the best,” said Thokozani. ALSO READ : MZANSI CELEBS WHO GRADUATED IN 2021! His music journey dates back to when he was still a school boy.
