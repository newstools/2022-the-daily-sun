SADIO Mane scored a dramatic late penalty as Senegal started the Africa Cup of Nations with a narrow 1-0 victory over Zimbabwe at Kouekong Stadium in Cameroon on Monday. Guatemala referee Mario Escobar adjudged Kelvin Madzongwe to have handled the ball inside the box in an attempt to block a goalbound shot. And Mane stepped up to thump the penalty past Petros Mhari in added time. Zimbabwe should feel hard done as they played above their standards, holding one of the tournament’s favourites for the better part of the match. Senegal is coming to this competition as the losing finalist in the 2019 final to Algeria. But they found a stubborn Zimbabwe side, who were searching for their first win in the Afcon finals since stunning victory over Ghana in 2006 Afcon finals in group stages. This means Zimbabwe are still searching for a first win at Afcon finals since then. Senegal, on the other hand, are making their 16th appearance at the Afcon, a record for a team that has never won the trophy. They came closest to winning the tournament in 2002 (lost the final on penalties against Cameroon) and 2019 (lost 1-0 to Algeria in the final). With the plethora of stars in this side from Bayern Munich, Liverpool and PSG to call upon, they couldn’t break down the Zimbabwe side until the referee’s added minute. Senegal, who only had 17 players because of Covid-19 and cases and injuries in their squad, were a constant threat to Zimbabwe’s goal. However,  they had to wait until the referee's optional for Mane to score.
