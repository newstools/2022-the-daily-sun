WHEN they were robbed for the first time last year, thugs took jewellery worth more than R5 000. But that’s nothing compared to the way they were robbed on Wednesday, 12 January. This time the thugs took the husband’s wrist watch, iPhone, S10 Samsung and HP laptop all to the value of more than R40 000. They also took two cars, bringing the loss to almost R400 000! Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs Police Station said the three men came armed with guns and bundled the family in a bedroom and demanded jewellery. “When the family said they didn’t have anything, they took the electronic items. On their way out, the suspects took two cars worth nearly R400 000,” he said. The vehicles taken are a white Mercedes-Benz SUV worth R280 000 and a white Chevy LDV valued at R100 000. The Chevy was later found by residents dumped in the neighbourhood and the Mercedes-Benz hasn’t been found. Ramphora said the husband was sitting with his daughter in the kitchen when two men entered the house. “They took them to the main bedroom where the wife was folding clothes.” Ramphora said the third suspect brought the daughter’s boyfriend who was in another room to join the other victims in the bedroom. The suspects told them to stay in the room as they ransacked the house. When the thugs left, the family ran to the neighbours for help and they contacted the police. Ramphora said no shots were fired and there were no injuries. The stolen vehicles were not insured.
