THE murder trial against two apartheid cops has been postponed by the high court in Joburg. Thlomedi Mfalapitsa, who was an askari and co-accused Christian Rorich, are on trial for allegedly luring four Cosas students to an unused mine dump in Krugersdorp, Mogale City in February 1982, claiming they would be trained as MK soldiers. The security branch cops rigged the pump house with explosives, which they detonated once the four young men were inside. Eustice “Bimbo” Madikela, Ntshingo Mataboge and Fanyana Nhlapo, aged between 17 and 21, were killed, while Zandisile Musi was badly hurt. Both accused face charges of murder and kidnapping. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said the matter was postponed to give Rorich time to find a lawyer. Before Mfalapitsa (67) defected to the security branch, he allegedly had a close relationship with Musi’s two older brothers, who served with him in MK in exile. Mfalapitsa was allegedly ordered by Jan Carel Coetzee, a commander in Vlakplaas, to lure the young men to the mine. The families want the court to order that the remains of Madikela, Nhlapo and Mataboge, buried at Kagiso Cemetery, be exhumed and subjected to forensic investigations. Mfalapitsa, Rorich, Coetzee and other security branch officers Willem Frederick Schoon and Abraham Grobbelaar were denied amnesty in May 1999 by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for their roles in the killings.
