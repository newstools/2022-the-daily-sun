COPS are looking for three house robbery suspects who allegedly held a family at gunpoint, ransacked their house and fled with several items. Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said on Friday, 14 January, a resident of a house in NU2 in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape, responded to a knock at the door at about 4am. “She said when she opened the door, three men wearing police uniform stormed inside. One of them held them at gunpoint while the others ransacked the house,” said Nkohli. He said the men made off with cash, a wallet and a cellphone. No one was injured. Nkohli said the police investigations led them to an abandoned shack where clothes and stolen items were recovered. The suspects are still at large and the police have asked anyone with information about their whereabouts to contact 082 441 9504 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111. Residents said the incident would make it very difficult for them to open their doors for cops, especially at night. A resident told Daily Sun: “We don’t trust police officers and incidents like these are making it even more difficult.”
