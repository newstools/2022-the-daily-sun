ROYAL AM have come out clear and confirmed that their goal poacher, Victor Letsoalo, is not up grabs, while vehemently refuting reports that he is up for sale. In a statement on Thursday, the club said Letsoalo is still contracted to the club until 2023, after they exercised their one-year option. Letsoalo, who is on a neck-and-neck race with Mamelodi Sundowns' Peter Shalulile on the goal scorers chart, with nine goals, four short of the Namibian, has been in the news that he could be on his way out of the club. But club chief executive, Snky Mnisi, has distanced Royal AM from such reports, especially that he is en rote to Kaizer Chiefs and talks are at an advanced stage. "People out there are trying to course instability in our team and cause confusion," said Mnisi in a statement. "We want to set the record straight and state categorically that we have not been in discussions with anyone concerning our player, besides what we hear on media. "We are also not interested to sell the boy as he is an important part of our participation and progress in the league. "We wish to request all people to refrain from this (sic) malicious statements which are damaging to the image of our team and brand Royal AM. "We all have to act responsibly and stop punting for the release of the player from our team. We are a professional team and we are just asking to be treated as such. "There is no deal nor any discussions with anyone. I hope this matter is now laid to rest and we would appreciate everyone to allow our team to continue with our successful journey in the PSL. More so considering where we come from and what we went through. "We also believe our position should be respected that there is a NOT FOR SALE board at the moment." Royal AM have confirmed the release of about seven players on Wednesday, as reported by SunSport, and Letsoalo was not in the list.
