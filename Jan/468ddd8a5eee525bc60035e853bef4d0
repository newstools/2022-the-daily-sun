RESIDENTS of Phoenix, KwaZulu-Natal, are living in fear after an anaconda snake escaped from its enclosure. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), the non-venomous reptile escaped from a temporary enclosure from its owner’s residence on Troy Street in Starwood on Thursday, 27 January. “The public is requested to be on the look-out for the 2m-long anaconda. The black and yellow female snake could easily constrict small cats and dogs,” Rusa said in a statement on Facebook. The unit said the snake was expected to grow a further 4m to 5m in the next few years.  “If anyone spots the anaconda, contact Rusa on 086 1234 333,” the statement concluded. According to animalia.bio, the anaconda is a non-venomous boa species endemic to southern South America. “It is one of the largest snakes in the world but smaller than its close relative, the green anaconda,” the website said. Social media users reacted to the post, saying the owner should be held accountable. Moodley Sharon said: “This is negligence on the owner’s part. This can also be a danger to small children, not only cats and dogs. Authorities should investigate if this owner has a permit to keep such a reptile at home around people.” Chantal Emser said anacondas should not be kept as pets. “They aren’t even native to South Africa and should be free in the correct environment,” she said. Khumbulani Amos Mbele added: “The owner needs to be arrested for putting other people’s lives at risk; for failure to take care of the pet.”
