SHE was last seen by her family on New Year’s eve when she left home in Bungwanini in Mbazwana, KZN to celebrate with her friends. And when Mandisa Mlambo didn’t return home the following day, her family started to look for her. The one-week search ended on Saturday, 8 January when the 14-year-old’s body was found in the nearby bush. Her father, Vusimuzi, said he became worried when Mandisa didn’t return home the following day. He said he called all her friends he knew, but they all said she was not with them. “We started to worry and searched for her, but she was nowhere to be found. We reported the matter to the cops after a few days,” he said. Vusimuzi said they continued to look for Mandisa with no luck. “When we heard the body of a woman was found in the nearby bush on Saturday, we rushed to see. When we got there we noticed the clothes were similar to those Mandisa was wearing when she left home. We saw her feet and those were the parts of the body that were left as the whole body was decomposed,” he said. Vusimuzi believes his daughter was killed on her way back home as her friend had said she left in the morning on New Year’s Day. “We will wait for the cops to give us an update,” he said. Mbazwana cops said they were searching for the suspect, and a case of murder was being investigated.
