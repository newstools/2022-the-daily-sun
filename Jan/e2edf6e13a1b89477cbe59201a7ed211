FORMER Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli has failed in his bid to have taxpayers foot his legal bills. Mdluli and his co-accused former supply chain manager Heine Barnard and former chief financial officer Solomon Lazarus appeared in the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday, 18 January to hear if the SA Police Service (SAPS) would accept his request. The court heard that the state was not ready to pay them. They had applied for state funding to pay for their legal costs as the criminal act they allegedly committed happened while they were employed by the SAPS. They face charges of corruption, fraud and theft, which were allegedly committed between 2008 and 2012 when they were at the helm of police Crime Intelligence. According to the indictment, Mdluli received payment of private trips to China and Singapore, private use of witness protection houses, conversion of this property for personal use and the leasing out of his private residence to the state to pay his bond. “The matter was postponed for the setting of a trial date. All of the accused have also been denied funding by their former employer, SAPS,” said NPA’s Investigating Directorate spokeswoman Sindisiwe Seboka. The matter will be back in court on 22 February.
