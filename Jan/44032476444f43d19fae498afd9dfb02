A MAN is accused of hacking his aunt and mother to death with a bush knife. It’s alleged the man was fighting with his mum and the aunt intervened. KZN Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza said she was extremely disturbed by the incident, which took place on Monday, 10 January. Khoza said details about the brutal murder were still sketchy. The incident took place in Sonweni Village in Umhlabuyalingana, northern KZN, “We are shocked by the extent of violence directed towards vulnerable people. Young people are supposed to be the ones protecting the elderly,” she said. Khoza praised the police for responding swiftly to make sure the suspect was arrested. “This is the second gruesome incident in the area. In December, a matric pupil was allegedly hacked to death by a neighbour,” she said. Khoza said at the time of her death, the pupil was waiting for her final examination results. “We want to see these vicious men serving years in prison. These killers do not deserve bail. “Although we subscribe the principle of innocence until proven guilty, the justice system must be seen doing its best to deal with injustices against women and children,” she said. Khoza said a team of social workers were sent to provide support to the affected families. She sent her heartfelt condolences to the families and promised they’d continue receiving support even after the funerals. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a murder case was opened at Emanguzi Police Station. “Both victims sustained multiple injuries to their bodies and were declared dead at the scene. A 38-year-old suspect was assaulted by community members. “He was taken to hospital where he is under police guard,” she said.
