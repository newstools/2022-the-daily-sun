Eskom cut
power supply to certain parts of Dlamini in Soweto on Friday after residents
allegedly denied them access to the area to install prepaid split meters. Eskom's
senior operations and maintenance manager Mashangu Xivambu said this happened
despite the power utility engaging with community leaders and residents about
the implementation of the project ahead of time. However, he
said, residents prevented Eskom from resuming work in the area on Thursday. Xivambu
said Eskom was in the process of installing prepaid split meters throughout
Gauteng following low payment trends that affected its revenue. Xivambu
said the installation of prepaid split meters would help customers to manage
their own electricity consumption. "Electricity
supply will not be restored until we receive confirmation that the community is
ready to allow our employees safe access into the area and will not interfere
with them while they do their work. "It is
important for Eskom to be certain that it can guarantee the safety of its
employees before it can dispatch them to resume with operations." SOURCE:
