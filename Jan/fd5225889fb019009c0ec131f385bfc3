THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has announced a new twist in the Kaizer Chiefs matter over the fixtures they failed to honour in December. Chiefs failed to honour their DStv Premiership match against Cape Town City and Golden Arrows early last month after a Covid-19 outbreak at Naturena. Chiefs had announced that they writted to PSL to request to postpone their December matches as the club recorded more than 40 Covid-19 cases, but their request was denied. Amakhosi were charged for failing to honour their fixture early this month but the club opted to appeal the decision. On Friday afternoon, PSL prosecutor Zola Majavu confirmed that the matter was postponed after Chiefs brought forward an application to arbitration at SA Football Association. “I can confirm that the matter proceeded in front of the PSL DC where upon Kaizer Chiefs brought an application for the DC to be stayed, pending the outcome of the urgent referral to arbitration under the auspices of SAFA,” Majavu told PSL Media department. “We agreed that the matter should and can be postponed, however, that timelines should be put in place so that the matter won’t fall through the cracks. “It was also agreed that this matter must be finalised as soon as possible, way before league is brought to an end. “With that acceptance the DC was inclined to grant to stand down until their arbitration at SAFA is finalised.“The matter was subsequently postponed to February, 25 at 16:00 at which time the matter would then proceed. "Of course depending on the outcome of the arbitration it may be that the matter may not proceed in the current format.“Whatever the outcome may be we should not preempt it. Should be the arbitration be finalised before, the prosecutor was directed to communicate with the members as to the next cause of action, mindful of the fact that no one at this stage knows what the outcome of that arbitration will be.”
