THE days of being slay queens and seeing men and women in blue in social media challenges are now a thing of the past. A circular stamped for circulation on 3 January was sent on 24 December to the National Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation and all police departments and divisions, signed by national commissioner Khehla Sitole. It said members were damaging SAPS’ professional image posing in uniform on social media. It also instructed commanders to monitor social media platforms where certain members bring the SAPS into disrepute, as videos or pictures posted were of indecent content and distasteful. “In instances where members are recognised, commanders must immediately take disciplinary action.” It stated some female cops were not complying with the dress code which states “nail polish of red, pink, brown or shades may be worn with the uniform so it does not harm the uniform.” The code stated nails may not be painted in a variety of colours and must be neat at all times. False nails were not allowed. “Displaying police equipment and the manner in which official firearms and ammunition are handled by members on social media platforms amounts to negligence and reckless behaviour, which cannot be condoned. Commanders must ensure all members are in full compliance as members must be inspected during parades to ensure conforming to the dress order.” TikTok influencer, Metro cop Tiyani Siphamele was not worried, but said should the Metro Department apply the rules, he will entertain his followers in his ordinary clothes. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda said what’s in the circular is nothing new and it reminded cops how to behave in public. He said it was important for them to go back to basics and know what they stood for.
