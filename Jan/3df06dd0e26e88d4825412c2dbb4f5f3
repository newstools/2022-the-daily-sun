Dear MizzBMY baby daddy and I have been dating for five years. Our son is three years old and my baby daddy recently told me that he’s bisexual. How can a person discover his sexuality in his 30s?  Is it possible that he’s lying to me because he wants to end our relationship? Dear SistaPeople are able to recognise their sexuality at an early age and hide it. This is due to various reasons such as being unable to face it and fear of judgement from family and friends. It’s possible that your baby daddy noticed his sexuality a long time ago but was just not ready to open up about it. People are capable of a lot and if it happens that he is just using his sexuality as an excuse to dump you, then you need to put yourself first and move on. Love can’t be forced. All the best!
