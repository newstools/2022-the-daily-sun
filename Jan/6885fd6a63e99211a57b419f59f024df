NOT everyone who passes matric wants to go to university. Some may want to go TVET colleges to pursue practical courses that will lead them to starting their own businesses. To prepare them, the Department of Basic Education introduces new subjects in Mzansi schools almost every year. And the total number of subjects introduced is now 19 – and some will be piloted this year. These subjects are aimed at giving pupils choices and to lead them to the right career path. The department said many of these subjects are aimed at directly helping those school-leaving pupils who will not necessarily complete grade 12, or enter university. The list of the subjects offered is as follows: 1. Art and Design 2. Agricultural Studies 3. Ancillary Healthcare 4. Aquaponics 5. Aviation Studies 6. Civil Technology 7. Consumer Studies 8. Digital Technology 9. Early Childhood Development 10. Electrical Technology 11. Hospitality Studies 12. Maritime Science 13. Maintenance and Upholstery 14. Mechanical Technology 15. Mining Science 16. Personal Care 17. Technical Mathematics 18. Technical Science 19. Wholesale and Retail The department said 54 schools were also being monitored for piloting and implementing the coding and robotics curriculum this year. The subjects will form part of the curriculum at different school levels from grade R to grade 9.
