A truck driver was shot and wounded following an alleged hijacking on the N1 in Johannesburg on Friday. Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said freeway patrol officers were on duty when they received a radio message of a truck driver who was injured on the N1 north close to the Malibongwe on-ramp. "When officers arrived at the scene at N1 Malibongwe, they were informed by a truck driver that he was hijacked. When they (the suspects) dropped him off, they shot him in both legs so that he couldn't get help. "The suspects then headed south and removed cameras which was fitted on the inside of the cab. This caused the truck to lose power and cut out. "The truck's engine then cut out, forcing the hijackers to stop," Minnaar said. He said the suspects abandoned the truck and fled the scene. No arrests had been made.
