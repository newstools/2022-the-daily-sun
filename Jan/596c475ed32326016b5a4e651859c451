THREE men were hospitalised on Wednesday, 26 January, after being attacked by a swarm of bees at a residence in Rooihuiskraal, Tshwane. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said their medics arrived at the house at 11.35am, to find the three men seated on the pavement being assessed by another service. “They found that they had sustained numerous stings. It is understood that the three men had been working in the garden when the bees attacked,” Meiring said. He said the men were treated and transported to a nearby hospital. According to ER24, bee attacks often occur when you inadvertently strike a nest while gardening, hiking or exploring. “If this happens, try to run away from the swarm in a straight line. Head for shelter – whether it’s a car, tent or building. Try to cover your exposed skin (especially your face) with clothing, towels or blankets.”
