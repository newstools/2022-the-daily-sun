SCHOOLS opened on Wednesday, 12 January. As much as some pupils were excited, there’s someone who was over the moon and couldn’t hold back her happiness. That person is mama Zandile Magudulela (50) from Lehae, south of Joburg. She told Daily Sun that when schools are closed, she suffers. “School feeds my family,” she said. She said she has been selling to pupils for more than 10 years. She sells at Lehae Primary School. “I have been able to raise my kids through school. I sell sweets and snacks at the gate. It’s better than doing nothing.” She said with the money she made she has been able to send her children to school. Mama Zandile said that before Covid she used to take home close to R500 a day. “Covid came and changed everything. We couldn’t sell during the break. We are only selling in the morning and we have to sit outside the school.” She said now on a good day, she makes R200. But that happens once in a while. She normally gets around R100. “We have to be thankful for whatever we get because there are people who don’t have it. I’m grateful for that R100 because my kids won’t sleep on empty stomachs.” She said she wishes that this year Covid would go away so that things go back to normal. “But I’m glad because schools have opened. At least I will be able to put food on the table,” she said. As Daily Sun was speaking to mama Zandile, pupils were coming in numbers to buy from her. “We love her snacks. They are neat and affordable,” said a nine-year-old. Mama Zandile said people, especially the youth, shouldn’t stay and fold hands just because jobs are not available. “Just do something,” she said.
