The only thing we got from his brother was the confirmation that there was an accident in the early hours of the morning. It looks like there was more than one vehicle involved. They suspect that the occupants of the other vehicle might be injured too. Jabu is in the same hospital (with some of them),” Marweshe told City Press. They also reported that Jabu allegedly left his car and fled from the scene because he feared for his life. “He had to run because his car crashed into the taxi.
