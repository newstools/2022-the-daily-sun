WARRIORS were crowned the champions of the inaugural DStv Compact Cup after they beat Coastal United 2-1 in the final at the FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Ruzaigh Gamildien displayed a man of the match performance, netting a brace in the fifth minute and 83rd minutes to ensure his side clinch the first-ever compact cup. Coastal United, a team, made up of players from Stellenbosch FC, Chippa United, Cape Town City FC, and Baroka FC, started the game on high scoring the match's opening goal in the first minute through Ashley Du Preez. Thabo Matlaba intercepted the ball from the Warriors and found Du Preez, who raced into the box and unleashed a shot that left Itumeleng Khune with no chance to make it 1-0. Their lead was short-lived as Warriors ( made up of Swallows FC, TS Galaxy, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs players) levelled matters in the fifth minute through Gamildien. The match lived up to expectations, chances were created, but the two sides could not convert most of them. They went to the break tied on 1-1. In the second half, the less than 2000 fans at the venue expected more goals, but that did not happen. It looked like the match was heading to penalties until another moment of brilliance from Gamildien, who got his second goal in the 83rd minute to give Warriors the lead, which proved to be enough to win them the match.In the last corner kick of the match, Coastal goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke went forward for the game's final corner, but his header went over the bar. The players will now return to their respective clubs to continue preparations for the DStv Premiership, which will resume on the second weekend of February. Early on the day, Dan "Dance" Malesela’s Dinaledi FC claimed a 1-0 win over John Maduka’s Amabutho FC in their 3rd and 4th place play-off match at the same venue.
