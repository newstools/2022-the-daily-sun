A BRAVE but stupid thug was bust after making himself at home in businessman Ace Ncobo’s plush private office. The young man, believed to have been high when the incident happened, broke into the office in Dutywa, Eastern Cape, on Sunday, 16 January, while the former PSL referee was away. The man, who was captured on security cameras, was discovered inside the offices by staff members. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ace said the thug helped himself to a towel and running shoes before cooking up a storm in the kitchenette and spending the night. He said he even used his toothbrushes! “That is my private office. It has a kitchenette and bathroom with a shower. Besides cooking meat, he took a shower and used my toothbrushes,” said Ace. However, the thug’s luxury overnight stay was cut short when Ace’s employees found him sleeping on Monday morning.

He said he changed his mind about pressing charges when he heard that the man was not a hardened criminal but a troubled youth dealing with addiction. “I immediately instructed that no charges be laid,” he said. Ace told the SunTeam that he was in the process of tracing the man’s family. “None of the Dutywa mapharas know him. I assume he is not from this town because if he were, he would have known that my business premises are a no-go zone for criminals,” he said. When Ace took to Facebook to share his experience, fans reacted with humorous comments.
