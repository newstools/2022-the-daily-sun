RESIDENTS of Madidi Village say Madibeng Municipality, North West, is not providing water. Gogo Martha Sekhu (83) told Daily Sun she used a walking stick and was unable to push a wheelbarrow to buy water. “It’s difficult to buy water daily. We appeal to the municipality to do something.” Feni Mathibedi (40) said the muni cipality knew about the issue. “Schools will be reopening and we’re stressed about how children are going to bath.” Tshegofatso Modipa (29) said water tankers only went to certain houses. “We can’t bath, wash or cook. We have to wait for rain and buy water.” Madala Morris Letswalo (68) said when he voted he thought things would change. “Not all of us have money to buy from those who have boreholes,” he said. Councillor Elisa Mokoena said residents could contact her any time so the matter could be resolved. Municipal spokesman Tumelo Tshabalala said tankers were on daily rotation to all wards. “Tshwane supply line’s pressure is reduced due to payment issues. Boreholes were vandalised and transformers stolen. Boreholes will be repaired but supply is an issue as we have to resolve billings.”
