BEFORE his death, Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu was worried about the future of South Africa. Reverend Frank Chikane said this while addressing mourners at the Cathedral of St Mary the Virgin in Joburg on Thursday, 30 December. “He was disappointed about what was happening. He did not think this was what we struggled for,” said Chikane, recalling their last meeting before the Arch’s death. “I told him he was too old to worry and should leave it to the younger leaders.” Chikane said he told him South Africans would do whatever was necessary to bring change.  “We, as South Africans, must make sure this country doesn’t continue as it is. I promised him that we will not rest until we have achieved the ideal society,” he said. Chikane was speaking at a memorial service hosted by the Anglican Church in Joburg and the City of Joburg. Tutu funeral service will be held in Cape Town on Saturday, 1 January. Chikane said: “The former Bishop of Johannesburg and the first black dean of the Cathedral of St Mary the Virgin fought the good fight. He has finished his race.” Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Joburg, Dr Steve Moreo said Tutu took his message to everyone with great passion. “There can be no excuse as we reflect on his legacy. “Our calling must be, in this age, to bear testimony on his life and the legacy he lived as he completed his mission on earth,” he said. – NEWS24
