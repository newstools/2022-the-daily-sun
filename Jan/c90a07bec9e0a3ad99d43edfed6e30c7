In a written apology he forwarded to the SunTeam, Putco wrote: “I’m sorry for allowing myself to be swept by the exciting wave of the Tempa Danceat work. My actions were careless and overlooked a few important safety regulations. Through this experience, I’ve been exposed to many aspects of my job and its responsibilities which I might have taken lightly before. “I know I could have handled my excitement about that song differently. A sincere word of apology goes to the management and my colleagues for letting them down.” SABC’s group executive for corporate affairs and marketing Gugu Ntuli said: “The SABC can confirm Mr Putco Mafani has been unscheduled on Umhlobo Wenene FM. As a matter of principle, the corporation does not discuss HR matters relating to its independent contractors in public.”
