 ETHIOPIA’s Africa Cup o Nations (Afcon) dream might be over, but they didn’t go down without a fight. The Walias, as they are affectionately known, will head home with their heads held high after they put up a solid effort in their final Group A match. They held the more fancied Burkina Faso to a hard-fought 1-1 draw at the Kouekong Stadium yesterday. Getaneh Kabede, the Walias skipper, cancelled out Cyrille Bayala’s first-half opener for The Stallions. The point will only serve as consolation for the Ethiopians who couldn’t avoid a fifth straight first-round exit at the tournament. Wubetu Abate's men finished with one point out of a possible nine having lost twice and drawn once. The Stallions, on the other hand, will march into the knockout stages having finished second in the group with four points. They will join Cameroon who won the group despite playing to a 1-1 draw against Cape Verde in their final group match The Stallions were able to bounce back from an opening defeat to the hosts by getting the better of the dangerous Blue Sharks in their penultimate group match. The 2013 Afcon finalists headed into their clash against the Ethiopians needing to avoid defeat to book their spot in the net round of the competition. And Kamou Malo's charges got the job done in the end, despite being made to sweat for it by the spirited Walias. They will now hope for another dream run into this year’s final but hopefully this time, go one better to win the tournament having come close nine years ago in Mzansi.
