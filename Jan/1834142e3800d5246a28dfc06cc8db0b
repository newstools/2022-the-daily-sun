Some parents will be giving their children pocket money now that schools have reopened. There are kids who are given more than what they actually need for lunch. This can lead them to buying alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. Sometimes as parents, we are the ones who push our kids in the wrong direction by giving them a lot of money. Other children are clever enough to budget the little they get from their parents for useful items. Some just waste it on drugs and junk.
