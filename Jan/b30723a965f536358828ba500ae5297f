DSTV Premiership defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns will not loan their star midfielder, Lesedi “TT” Kapinga, during this month’s transfer window period. The 26-year-old has been struggling for game time this season under Downs’ joint coaches – Steve Komphela, Rhulani Mokwena and Manqoba Mngqithi. In Downs’ 19 league matches this season, Kapinga, who joined the Brazilians last season on a five-year deal, has only featured four times and scored one goal. But Kapinga’s manager Moses Mudau told SunSport that the Musina-born star will remain with Downs, and said he is happy at the Tshwane giants. “We’ve seen and heard people talking that Kapinga will be loaned,” said Mudau. “But the truth is, Kapinga is in the coaches’ plans. His (Kapinga) goal is to continue to work hard and wait for his chance. “He played in Sundowns’ league game before the season closed for the Christmas break, and he did well and even scored a goal that helped Sundowns get a point against Marumo Gallants.” At the Brazilians, the former Black Leopards and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila star is fighting for his position with the likes of Themba Zwane, Sphelele Mkhulise, Lyle Lakay, Thapelo Morena, Thabiso Kutumela, Neo Maema and Gaston Sirino. “Kapinga joined Sundowns because he loves the team and he was aware of the challenges ahead,” added Mudau. “He (Kapinga) has learnt a lot at Downs and we’re happy with his progress. We are confident that he will get a chance to play as there are still many matches Sundowns are still going to play this season, like the Caf Champions League, Premiership and Nedbank Cup.”
