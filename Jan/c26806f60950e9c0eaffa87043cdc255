HOSI Madala Nkuna of the Hoxane Traditional Council was laid to rest on Saturday, 1 January. Mourners gathered at the royal family cemetery in Mkhuhlu, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, to honour the 45-year-old, who died of cancer on Christmas Day. Speaker after speaker described him as a people’s person who was peaceful, intelligent and funny. They said he smiled even when he was in extreme pain, and the void left by his death would never be filled. The funeral was attended by Mpumalanga Co-operative Governance MEC Busi Shiba, Health MEC Sasekani Manzini, member of parliament Timothy Mashele, Bushbuckridge Mayor Sylvia Nxumalo, Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa president Kgoshi Mathibela Mokoena, businesspeople, church leaders, as well as residents.  His uncle Sidwell Nkuna told mourners that Hosi Nkuna died just a few days after being admitted to Medi-Clinic in Mbombela. “He started suffering from cancer in 2020. He was in and out of the hospital. His condition became worse a few days after he was discharged from hospital while he was attending a meeting with amakhosi in Ermelo,” he said. His sister Cindy Nkuna-Nxumalo said it was very painful to lose her brother. MEC Shiba said Hosi has made his land a better place through development. “He left a legacy for generations to come. We wish to extend our condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the Hoxane Traditional Council and its people. “The death of a beloved member is a complex and depressing thing,” he said. He is survived by his wife Connie Khoza, his three kids, his mother Lisbeth, and siblings Sydney and Cindy.
