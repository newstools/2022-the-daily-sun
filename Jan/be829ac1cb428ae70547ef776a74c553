SAKHILE Phangalele appeared briefly in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrates Court for a formal bail application. But due to a number of cases that were heard by Magistrate Busisiwe Mnisi, the hearing was postponed to 14 February. Phangalele was arrested on 26 December for allegedly murdering his wife, Mpona Phangalele (38). The murder-accused was accosted by residents of Tshepiso, Phase 4, when he went into hiding. He was then moered and handed over to the cops. As Mnisi chaired all the hearings that happened earlier on Tuesday, 18 January, scores of residents were chanting and singing, holding placards demanding for bail to be denied. Speaking to Daily Sun, community leader and resident Meshack Tladi said they were happy Phangalele would remain behind bars. “We came out in numbers to support Mpona. The man deserves to remain behind bars until he is sentenced,” he said. Tladi said should Phangalele be released on bail, residents would take justice into their own hands. “Residents are angry. We are here because we want to send a message. The courts better keep him behind bars,” he said.
