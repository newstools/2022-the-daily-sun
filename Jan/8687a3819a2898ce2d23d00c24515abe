AMAZULU have confirmed the signing of versatile Abbubaker Mobara from Cape Town City and South Sudan international Abraham Majok. SunSport confirmed a few days ago that talks between the two parties (City and AmaZulu) were at an advanced stage to see Mobara join Usuthu in the second half of the season. Unfortunately, Mobara is in isolation having contacted the Covid-19. That meant he wasn’t available to be at yesterday’s media unveiling. However, Majok a towering striker was at the AmaZulu press conference. The 27-year-old Mobara is not arriving on a free transfer. Usuthu paid an undisclosed fee for the former Orlando Pirates and Bafana international as he was under contract until the end of next season. Usuthu coach Benni McCarthy worked with Mobara when the latter joined City at the beginning of the 2019-20 season from Pirates. However, McCarthy was later let go by the club in November 2019. “We have acquired two great signings,” said AmaZulu president Sandile Zungu. “We have got a striker (Majok) and we also have a versatile player Mobara) who (can play) box to box (in midfield) and in defence, and who  is creative.” Majok was previously playing for Australian club Central Coast Mariners FC in the youth development. As a striker, he will fight it out for the starting place at Usuthu with Lehlohonolo Majoro, Bongi Ntuli, Siphelele Mthembu and Andre de Jong.
