ROYAL AM have released seven players to trim their squad to a manageable size in a bid to maintain their positive start in the DStv Premiership. The KwaZulu Natal side have released defender Ronald Pfumbidzai, midfielder Siphelele Luthuli and striker Sera Motebang who joined Chippa United. They have parted ways with centre-back Mereko Mokone, striker Tshepo Malope, and midfielder Tshepo Moeketsi who joined GladAfrica Championship side Richards Bay. The club has also released veteran midfielder Lucky Baloyi who joined Maritzburg United. Royal AM CEO Sinky Mnisi revealed that they won’t sign a single player in the current window period to allow coach John Maduka to work with a smaller squad. Said Mnisi: “We need to have a manageable squad. It’s not wise to have a big squad and that’s why we took this decision.”
