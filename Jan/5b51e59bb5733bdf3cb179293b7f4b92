A 40-YEAR-OLD man, accused of killing children, has abandoned his bail application. He briefly appeared in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrates Court on Friday, 28 January, facing two counts of murder, two of attempted murder and four of kidnapping. It is alleged that on 18 January, the accused killed two boys, aged five and 11, and attempted to kill two others, aged seven and 11. “The accused is a stepfather to one of the boys he attempted to kill, however, all four are related,” said National Prosecuting Authority north Gauteng region spokeswoman Lumka Mahajan. She added that the man, originally from Eastern Cape, was arrested on 19 January at a taxi rank in Joburg. The matter was postponed to 25 February for further investigations.
