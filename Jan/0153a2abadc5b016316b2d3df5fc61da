MZANSI has been experiencing rainy weather for several weeks
and driving in slick conditions can lead to accidents. Motorists have always been advised to reduce speed and to be
more cautious on the road while accommodating the conditions of the road,
however, only a few drivers do that. In a video that has gone viral on social media, a red truck
and white Jaguar can be seen driving in two parallel lanes on a highway, but
soon after that, the truck indicates to the right where the Jaguar is at. It seems as though the driver could see the car and crashed
into the back of the Jaguar pushing it to the front of the truck and ultimately
it ended up on the side of the road. A post shared by Crazy Car Crashes! (@crashclip)
