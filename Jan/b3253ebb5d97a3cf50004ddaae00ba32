Mpumalanga
police shot dead three alleged robbers on Thursday night. The men
were allegedly part of a group who stormed into a store stealing items but were
later killed in a shootout with police. Police
spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the incident happened in Block A in
Tonga. He said
according to information, a group of heavily armed suspects charged into a
supermarket and stole items such as cigarettes, television sets, airtime, as
well as an undisclosed amount of cash. They then fled in a vehicle. "The
matter was reported to the police, who responded swiftly and immediately
searched for the suspects. They (police) spotted the suspects in a white Ford
Bantam which matched the description of the vehicle used to flee the scene. "Upon
noticing the police, the suspects fired at them, and the police retaliated, fatally
wounding three of the suspects, while one managed to escape. "Anyone
with information that can lead to the arrest of the remaining suspect is urged
to immediately contact Colonel Nancy Mnisi on 072 603 8438 or the Crime Stop
number 08600 10111. Alternatively, members of the public can send information
via the My SAPS app. All received information will be treated as confidential,
and callers may opt to remain anonymous," Mohlala said. Mpumalanga
police commissioner Lieutenant General Semakaleng Manamela has applauded the
Tonga police "for being dedicated to the cause of fighting crime as well
as their act of bravery". SOURCE:
