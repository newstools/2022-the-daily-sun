THE case against four suspects who are accused of killing Sam Mbatha has been postponed to 2 February by the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court. The four accused Arthur Khoza (19), Thato Masetla (22), Junior Modise (21) and Mahlatsi Nkuna (21) were charged with the murder. This after investigations led the police to a house in Phutha section in Klipgat on 21 June. The house was searched and the police found blood stains on the floor of one of the bedrooms, on top of a bed as well as on the carpet. Furthermore, an axe suspected to have been used during the commission of the crime was found on top of the roof of the house. Last week, DNA samples positively identified Mbatha as the deceased person whose body was found inside a burnt Hyundai i20 at a soccer field in Ikageng section. This after he went missing in June last year. National Prosecuting Authority spokesman in North West Henry Mamothame said the state would await the Director of Public Prosecution’s authorisation of transferring the matter to the North West Division of the High Court owing to the serious nature of the offence committed. Masetlha abandoned his bail application while the other three are out on R500 bail each. Their bail conditions are that they must report at the Klipgat Police Station every Wednesday and Sunday between 5pm and 6pm, and they are also barred from interfering with the state’s witnesses. Family spokesman Kgomotso Sepeng said a memorial service for Mbatha would be held on Wednesday, 19 January at North West University in Mafikeng campus and that he would be laid to rest on Friday, 21 January at Klipgat.
