RAPPER Anatii had his fans excited after showing proof of life. The Ntloni hitmaker was silent for a year and wasn’t posting on social media. He finally posted a picture of himself on Twitter to show people he’s still around. He was celebrating his 29th birthday and captioned his picture: “Proof of life, more blessings #29.” The rapper did the same last year when he posted a picture on his birthday and his fans thought he was back on social media, but he didn’t return. On Instagram, he posted a series of pictures and a clip of music he is working on. He also posted a message he got from a fan asking him where he is. Industry friends and fans welcomed him back on Instagram and asked him to release new music or an album. Instagram user Imbube Ibee commented: “Welcome back. Can’t wait for new music from you, bene mini emnandi.” Another user Palmtree Omo wrote: “Happy Birthday, bhuda.
