A BUS strike is looming if drivers do not get a salary increase. On Friday, 28 January, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) presented its demands to the bus passenger bargaining forum. The union demanded that the lowest paid driver get an increase from R7 800 to R12 000 a month. It also wanted an industry medical aid that would cover all workers, for the company to contribute 80% and workers contribute 20% as well as housing allowance. Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said the workers had not been able to get a meaningful increase in two years because of Covid-19. He said employers had claimed that they could not afford their demands because of the impact of the pandemic on profits. “They also claim that they are not satisfied with the subsidy the government gives them. We reject this explanation because they refuse to disclose how much they receive. Therefore, how can we be expected to believe them when they claim it is too little? They must disclose so we can know for a fact whether it is sustainable or not,” said Jim. He added that they were fortunate because they were being subsidised while ordinary workers were not, and they had been carrying the entire sector on their backs. He said they were also demanding that overtime be reduced from 14-hour shifts to 10. “The talks are ongoing. We are hoping to find each other with the employer without having to resort to strike action. The main agreement expires on 31 March and we need a new one in place by 1 April. We are doing everything possible to ensure that we reach an agreement before then,” said Jim.
