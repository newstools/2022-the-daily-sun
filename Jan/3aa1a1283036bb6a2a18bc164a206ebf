The man charged with smashing windows and glass doors at the
Constitutional Court using a hammer could face an additional charge of
contravening the National Key Points Act. Paul Makaula, 36, made his first appearance in the Hillbrow
Magistrate's Court in Johannesburg on Friday on charges of malicious damage to
property after allegedly smashing several windows and glass doors at the
Constitutional Court on Wednesday. The court heard that he has been out on parole since 2019
for a 2010 murder. Prosecutor advocate Riana Williams told the court the State
was looking at adding additional charges after Makaula allegedly caused damage
to the tune of R50 000. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi
Mjonondwane said they were trying to determine which charges in terms of the
National Key Points Act the State wanted to add. "As the NPA, we view this matter in a very serious
light, and remember that the alleged attack happened at a national key point.
We view it as a direct attack on the rule of law and we believe that we are up
to the task,” she said According to Mjonondwane, investigations were still at an
early stage. She said at this stage, there was no indication that the incident
was linked to the fire at Parliament. "As the investigations... progress, we will be in a
better position to tell whether or not this is a politically motivated act or
whether it's an individual act or whether or not it is linked to the Cape Town
one (fire at Parliament)," she said. Makaula looked composed in the dock as the magistrate
quizzed him on whether he understood the proceedings. A 36-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly using a
hammer to smash windows at the Constitutional Court. He has opted to abandon bail, and he will be back in court
in March. SOURCE: NEWS24
