Jose Bila (38) was shot in the head and killed while trying to stop the fleeing thug. A witness told Daily Sun the girl was walking in the street at the time.  “When the guys tried to stop him, he shot through a bag he was carrying the gun in. He fired a shot and hit Xolani. He was then chased by two guys and he shot one, who died on the scene. He kept shooting until he was caught and beaten by the community,” said the witness. Xolani’s gogo, Hluphekile Mnguni, (83) was hoping for a speedy recovery.  “I was in the house washing dishes. Suddenly, I heard gunshots and a girl screaming. I peeped through the window and saw Xolani’s friend, who came to tell me he had been shot,” she said. Jose’s friend, Zakariah Manyike, (34) said he was devastated. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo confirmed the incident, revealing that the suspect was working with two others, who were arrested on Tuesday and charged with robbery, murder and attempted murder. Another case was opened for those who killed the suspect.
