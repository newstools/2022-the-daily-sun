TSHWANE MMC for health Rina Marx says they are worried about the high teenage pregnancy rate at the city’s public health facilities, which have over the past three years recorded about 10 000 teenage deliveries. She said this shows a concerning high number of teen pregnancies in the Metro. According to Marx, between July 2019 and last June, the city recorded 9 922 teenage deliveries by 674 girls aged 10 to 14 and another 9 248 girls aged 15 to 19 years old. “The high incidence of teenage pregnancies has many socio-economic consequences. “Often babies are abandoned or given up for adoption, which places an additional burden on the child welfare system,” Marx said. She said teen pregnancies present a lot of challenges, including health, school drop-outs and financial stress. “The city would like to encourage young people to abstain from risky behaviour that may lead to early or unwanted pregnancies. Teenage early sexual activity also increases the risk of contracting and spreading sexually transmitted disease such as HIV.” Marx said teens and their parents were advised to visit municipal clinics for services, information on teenage pregnancy, choices on possible termination of pregnancy and contraceptives. She said free contraceptives and happy-hour sessions took place between 2pm and 3pm daily, where teenagers could get preference to receive health services and advice.
