MAMELODI Sundowns legend Surprise Moriri's mobile phone has been hacked, and his number is being used to scam his contacts. A concerned Moriri told Sunsport that his mobile phone that contains the digits 072, has been hacked. He stressed that someone has been sending messages to his contacts pretending to be the Downs development coach claiming that he has been arrested, and in need of money to pay for his bail. “My phone was hacked on Tuesday at 11pm and we got a message from one of my contacts that I am arrested in a Police Station, and I need bail money. I inquired with Vodacom, and I was told that someone did a sim swap using my number. I want to inform all my contacts who have received these messages, please ignore them as they are not from me. I am okay and not arrested. I have since blocked the number. Another message alleges that Moriri is running soccer trials and is asking for money to pay for players accommodation. “I am not running any trials and we always use the club’s media platforms to do so. I want to appologise to all my contacts who have received these messages.” This is not the first time that someone in the football industry has been hacked, SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo was also a victim of scammers together with former Sundowns captain Thabo Nthethe.
