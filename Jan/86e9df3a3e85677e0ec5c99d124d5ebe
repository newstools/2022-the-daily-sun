IDOLS SA runner-up, Sneziey, has a new name. She is now Omingentando Vusani Dlamini. Sneziey revealed that she was given this name by her in-laws
in the Eastern Cape after they officially welcomed her as their makoti. She re-introduced herself to her fans on Instagram. The musician, who was raised by her granny in Durban, got
married to her husband in December 2021 after her engagement in November. She
seems to enjoy being a makoti as she has been splashing photos wearing the
makoti Xhosa attire on social media. Sneziey said she loves her new name, it suits her as a
Christian. "This name gives me courage to trust God even more. It
says I must let God do it for me. His will can never be changed by anything or
anyone. I love my new name," said Sneziey. She said the makoti duties won't interfere with her music
career. "I'm still a musician and my husband is supportive. I'm
just grateful that God gave me someone to pray and walk my journey with." Sneziey once revealed that she met her husband on Facebook.
They got engaged after nine months of dating.
