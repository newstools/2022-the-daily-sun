MANY people respect and fear graveyards. But not thugs in Saldanha in the Western Cape. This is because they prefer to introduce the living to the dead! They do this by robbing residents who pass by Diazville cemetery. As if that’s not enough, they also push their victims into open graves in the graveyard. Residents are concerned by this and wish the criminals respected the dead. “Everyone knows how dangerous walking in that cemetery is. The thugs rob you and throw you in one of the open graves, which is scary,” said Monwabisi Jija (55). Monwabisi from Marikana squatter camp said people have lost their valuables to thugs. “When they see a victim coming, they pretend as if they’re smoking, but they rob you as soon as you reach them,” he said. Another resident said they didn’t understand why the dead would allow criminals to terrorise residents. “I do not think the dead are resting in peace. There is no peace there because when people get robbed. They scream and run on top of the graves,” said the resident. Mandisa Fulani (37) said when she first heard about residents getting robbed at the cemetery, she thought people were lying. “It was hard to believe that people can be robbed at the cemetery until it happened to my neighbour. They took her money and cellphone,” she said. She said walking in groups has helped to keep them safe. “We came up with a plan to walk in groups when passing that cemetery. It’s a shame that we fear dead people, but criminals have turned a graveyard into a place to rob people,” said Mandisa. When asked if they reported the matter to the cops, residents said they didn’t because nothing would happen to the tsotsis.
