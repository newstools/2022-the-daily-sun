I would like to encourage the National Energy Regulator of South Africa to reject the application put by Eskom to hike tariffs by 20,5%. The percentage is way too much and will hit consumers hard, especially the poor. We have had too many blows due to job losses owing to Covid-19 and other socio-economic challenges. The regulator must stop the state-owned entity from shattering the lives of the poor and vulnerable. People are struggling to put food on the table, yet the power utility sees it fit to propose a figure many times greater than the inflation rate. It’s even worse when one considers that the same overpaying consumers experience load shedding. That’s unfair and violates our rights.
