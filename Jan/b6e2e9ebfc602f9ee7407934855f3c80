A man was
killed in a head-on collision between a sedan and a minibus taxi in Diepsloot,
Johannesburg, while another was seriously injured. Emergency
services found a red Mazda sedan mangled on the R114, with the body having
broken into two. The vehicle had lost some of its wheels and a section of the
chassis could be seen lying on the side of the road. The
30-year-old man was killed in the collision near Heron Bridge on Thursday. The
second victim was in a critical condition, said Emer-G-Med paramedics. "Paramedics
arrived on the scene just after 08:30 to find the twisted frame of a light
motor vehicle and a minibus taxi occupying the width of the roadway," said
Emer-G-Med spokesperson Kyle van Reenen. "On
closer inspection of the light motor vehicle, a male was found to have
sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead." The second
victim was found in a critical condition and several advanced life support
interventions were needed to stabilise him. He was transported to a nearby
hospital. "The
South African Police Service was in attendance and will be conducting the
necessary investigation," he added. SOURCE:
