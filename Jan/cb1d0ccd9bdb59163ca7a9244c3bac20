Greedy taxi drivers and patrollers must respect other motorists. They intimidate drivers for offering lifts to stranded people, and they have no right to do that. They are a law unto themselves. People have the right to use whichever mode of transport they desire and in the same breath, the driver has a right to transport any person. The taxi industry has a law which says a person is not allowed to lift someone 300 metres from the taxi rank. There’s no law that says every individual who is about to take a trip belongs to the taxi industry. It’s wrong to force people to take taxis. Many hitchhikers have since moved from the popular thumbing spots to other spots just for a ride to go home. Not all people can afford taxi fares. People want to go home to their families after work. Who gives taxi drivers a right to beat or harass someone for not having money for a taxi? There is not one set of rules for taxi drivers and another set for the rest of us. Again, to the taxi industry – grow up, act like the valuable service you claim to be and stop extorting money and being the villains in this game of life. Until then, you will remain the bad guys.
