PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) prosecutor Zola Majavu has charged Orlando Pirates FC for the incident in which TS Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi was denied entry to the field and change rooms during a match at Orlando Stadium. The much-publicised incident took place on 11 December, where there was an off-field controversy between officials of the two clubs. Galaxy’s media officer Minenhle Mkhize alleged that he was slapped in the face by his Pirates counterpart Thandi Merafe on the same day, and opened a case with the police. In the latest update from PSL, Majavu confirmed that Pirates were set for a hearing next Wednesday concerning the event. “Orlando Pirates have been charged and the matter has been enrolled for hearing on 26 January,” Majavu said on Thursday, 20 January. “This is in relation to the misconduct arising from the chairman of TS Galaxy being denied entry into the stadium. When finalised, I will provide further update on the outcome of the hearing,” added Majavu.
