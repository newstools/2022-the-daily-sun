KING Ndlovu has channelled his focus on helping Marumo Gallants defend the Nedbank Cup and finish the season in the top eight, instead of worrying about his future. The lanky goalkeeper’s one-year contract with Gallants expires in June, and he’s still in the dark whether the club will renew it or not. Ndlovu has played just one match this season, helping Gallants hold runaway leaders Mamelodi Sundowns to a 1-1 draw prior to the festive break. He has been second choice to Washington Arubi, who has made 21 appearances in all competitions. The 28-year-old is entitled to sign a pre-contract with another club six month before his contract lapses. Said Ndlovu: “There’s no other club that has approached me. My focus is on helping Gallants defend the Nedbank Cup, and we all want to win something.” However, Ndlovu said he has been working hard at training to ensure he gets more game time when the PSL resumes. Gallants will face ABC Motsepe League side Santos in the Ke Yona Cup first round match, and then host Baroka FC in the DStv Premiership Limpopo derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 16 February. Said Ndlovu: “I am delighted to get game time. It has been a long time since I played (prior to Downs match) and the last time was in April. “I’m happy to finally get a chance. You should understand that this is a difficult and fragile position. You can’t change a goalkeeper every now and then. Arubi played well and I had to be patient and wait for my chance.” Ndlovu believes he has done enough against Sundowns to convince coach Dan Malesela to give him another chance to play. He added: “I was a bit nervous (against Downs), but I had to go out there do my best and see what happens. It was good to get a draw and the fact that we didn’t lose to Sundowns away. “We ended the year on a positive note, but I will take one game at a time, continue playing until I reach my full potential. My teammates have been supportive telling me to keep working hard.”
