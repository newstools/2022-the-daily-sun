FANS of Mugwanti hitmaker Mujava gathered on Facebook to appreciate the good music he did. A post on a page called SA House Music Downloads shows his photo, saying Mujava was one of Mzansi’s best producers. Mujava is known as a pioneer of Pretoria-born genre barcadi. “I really hope this legend right here gets back on his feet. Damn you nyoape for robbing us of this great talent. Mujava still remains one of the best producers we’ve ever had in Mzansi,” it said. Facebook users were worried about Mujava and said it seemed like he wasn’t well, some saying they’d pray for him.
