A SOWETO woman who allegedly pulled off one of Mzansi’s most daring heists has dropped her bail application. Bathobile Mlangeni (29) appeared in the Alexandra Magistrates Court on Monday, 24 January to ask the court to release her, but she changed her mind and decided to be kept in custody. Mlangeni allegedly stole R4 million from SBV Services, where she worked as a security guard in 2019. According to the indictment, she walked into a depot inside the Mall of Africa in Midrand and walked out with R4 million in a trolley without firing a single shot. CCTV footage of someone loading cash in two bags went viral on social media at the time. Mlangeni was bust while staying with family friend, Vangille Dlamini in Zola, Soweto. The 82-year-old gogo said Mlangeni came to her house and didn’t tell her she was on the run, or was there anything that showed she had money. Gogo said Mlangeni would ask her for R5s to buy herself cigarettes. Before she went to Zola, Mlangeni apparently rented an RDP house in Buhle Park, Ekurhuleni.. She told neighbours she was running away from an abusive boyfriend. Mlangeni faces a charge of theft. The matter was postponed to 18 February.
