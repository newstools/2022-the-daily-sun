Despite
completing their final year of high school amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the
class of 2021's National Senior Certificate (NSC) pass rate was 98.39%. Nearly all
of them (89.2%) achieved entry to degree study at a tertiary level. According
to the Independent Examinations Board (IEB), which released the NSC results on
Wednesday, the pass rate for the class of 2021 was slightly better when
compared with the previous year's pass rate of 98.06%. Of those
who passed: 7.82%
qualified for admission to diploma study, compared to 8.14% in 2020.1.37%
achieved admission for study at the higher certificate level, compared to 1.5%
in 2020. The IEB
said the matric class of 2021 consisted of 12 857 full-time and 968 part-time
candidates from 238 examination centres writing in 267 venues between October
and November across southern Africa. "As
with an iceberg, the achievement we see in the class of 2021 hides the depth of
the struggle and effort that underpins this success," its CEO, Anne
Oberholzer, added, saying: These Grade
12 learners were the true victims of Covid-19. The Class of 2021 has had to dig
deep mentally and emotionally to find the strength to face the tremendous
challenges of a radically changed teaching and learning environment of the last
two years. They truly deserve the accolades they receive. Oberholzer
added the 2021 matriculants had spent both grades 11 and 12 in the pandemic,
which impacted them severely as Grade 11 was often "spent primarily on
ensuring that learners have a firm grasp and full understanding of key concepts
and content in their respective subjects of study". For the
class of 2021, they experienced sporadic school closures throughout 2020, which
brought about disruptive changes of an unprecedented nature within a relatively
short space of time. This was
exacerbated by the fact that in 2020, the teaching focused primarily on
ensuring that Grade 12 pupils were given as much attention as possible to
ensure they could succeed in their final examinations. "Most
Grade 11 learners in 2020 spent much less time at school and were essentially
the test cases of the greatest online tuition experiment of our time. Despite
its varied rate of success, one thing is certain - the use of technology in
education is here to stay, as it should be," Oberholzer said. "There's
no doubt that online learning cannot replace a good teacher in person, however,
it is far better than no teacher and no guidance." She added
the class of 2021 had to find new ways to deal with the challenges they were
served and build the resilience, courage and persistence to overcome them. "We
cannot underestimate the impact of disappointments of missing out on key social
events that are key in a matric learner's life, the important social
experiences that are fundamental as they grapple with young adulthood, and the
frustration of uncertainty that Covid-19 brought to almost every facet of their
lives. "All
of these struggles form part of the iceberg that lies out of view. Overcoming
these difficulties has been the true achievement of the class of 2021, and this
experience can only benefit them on their path of lifelong learning." SOURCE:
