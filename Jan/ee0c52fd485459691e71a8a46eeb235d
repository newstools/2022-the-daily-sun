AUDI’S Quattro four-wheel drive system has been labelled as one of the best. When the Quattro was introduced among its rally cars, it was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show in 1980. Now, in a video that went viral on social media, an Audi RS3 that looks like a 2020 model can be seen trying to tow an 18-wheeler truck that seems stuck in the snow. At first, it looked like a massive task for the German hatchback, but then it manages to tow the truck out of the snow. Did you know that an Audi RS3 can be used to tow trucks?? #VrrphaaTuesday @gmancarreviews #GCR pic.twitter.com/mmLQMvdWdG
