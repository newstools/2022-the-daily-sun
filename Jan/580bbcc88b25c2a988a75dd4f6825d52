ACTRESS and producer Ayanda Borotho has asked her fans to be careful and not fall victim to a scam. She’s exposed multiple fake TikTok accounts in her name, saying she doesn’t have a TikTok account. Ayanda also said she cannot make people R80 000 a week, like the accounts claim, because she isn’t part of any investment scheme, forex trading platform or pyramid scheme. “WARNING!!!!!! Please be aware that I DO NOT HAVE A TIKTOK ACCOUNT. I also don’t have access to a platform where people can make R80k a week etcetera. I’m not part of any investment scheme, forex trading platform or pyramid scheme. I don’t recruit people to make money,” she said. The Wounds actress said she’s reported the accounts and continues to do so. She also urged people to report them too. “I will NEVER DM/ Inbox you about such, nor ask you to invest money in any of these. Please be aware of the various accounts on TikTok created under false pretences using my name. We have reported them, but they continue to set up different ones. If you come across these accounts, please report them.

Recently, Uthando Nesthembu star Mbali “MaNgwabe” Mseleku was also a victim of a fake account created in her name and she warned people against it. She spoke to Daily Sun last week. “I don’t understand how people can be this heartless. I recently found out there’s a fake social media account after people came to my workplace and accused me of selling them a car that doesn’t exist. This broke my heart and has affected me because it brings my name into disrepute. I am kindly pleading with people to stop doing this,” MaNgwabe said.
