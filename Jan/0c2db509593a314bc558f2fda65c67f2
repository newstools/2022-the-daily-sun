VIBE FM presenter and Ukhozi FM contributor Lwazi ‘Mlwazet’ Mdladla’s mission to discover up-and-coming artists continues. Mlwazet, under his foundation called Mlwazet Bavundulule Foundation, has opened the call for entries to up-and-coming artists to enter the competition under 20 categories, including maskandi, gospel, hip-hop, kwaito/gqom and amapiano. Mlwazet from KwaMashu, north of Durban, said he had allocated R100 000 to discover and help the newbies make their dreams come true. He told SunBuzz this would be the foundation’s third annual competition and they were looking for 100 aspiring artists in Mzansi. “We will have 20 categories and we will only take the five best artists per category or genre. Each winner will get R1000 in cash. After we have discovered the artists we are looking for, we will then stage a festival where they will perform in front of well-known recording companies who will be there to scout talent,” he said.
