IF THERE’S anything most us look forward to on a busy day, it’s going to sleep at night. While a lot has been said about the health benefits of sleeping in your birthday suit, recent studies and trends have shown that there are health benefits to sleeping in your pyjamas. According to pajamasforpeace.com, these are some of the health benefits that come with sleeping with your pyjamas on: 1. Protects your body against the cold Pyjamas have several benefits like keeping your body warm. Pyjamas cover your legs completely and protect your legs from the cold throughout the night. While you may consider adding blankets during the winter season, having warm pyjamas during the cold nights is more effective. 2. Prevents illnesses Wearing pyjamas at night lowers the risk of getting a cold or flu. In case you accidentally knock your blankets off while asleep, your body remains warm and this is important as temperatures naturally drop at night according to climatology. 3. They are great for body hygiene Our skin sheds a lot of the dead cells full of microorganisms while sleeping. According to health experts, these microorganisms may not be harmful, but they may cause problems if they get into the wrong place in the human body. When you go to bed in your pyjamas, most of the dead skin and bacteria will end up in your attire, and not on your bed sheets. Your sleepwear acts as a barrier between your body and bed sheets. According to Medical Daily, if you don’t wash your pyjamas properly and regularly, you may be susceptible to cystitis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (a cause of staph infection) and skin infections. 4. Great for comfort In order to get a good night’s sleep, you need to feel comfortable. Being comfortable in your sleep will help you get into a deep sleep quickly and stay there without interruptions. You can get a nice pair of pyjamas with the right material for your skin.
