GRAVEYARDS are sacred places, but the donkeys don’t always see it that way! Donkeys in Tweefontein near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, are turning the local graveyard into a grazing field. Residents said the donkeys also destroy the gravestones. Sodiye Mahlangu (64) said they go to the graveyard every day to chase the donkeys. “They break the gravestones when they scratch their bodies. We want the municipality puts fence around the graves. “The donkeys are attracted by the long grass. Families who own graves must come to clean them so that the donkeys don’t graze here,” said Sodiye. Lucas Mahlangu (65) said they spoke to the owners of the donkeys, but with no luck. “The donkey owners should drive them to the bush. Gravestones are expensive. The donkeys disturb the dead who are supposed to rest in peace.

Now families are left with the burden of fixing the gravestones again and then slaughter a goat or cow to appease the dead,” he said. Sangoma Mehlwemamba Sikhosana said it’s a taboo for animals to step on graves. “Graveyards should always be quiet and the dead rest in peace. Allowing animals into the graves is a sign of disrespect.” Thembisile Hani municipal spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane Mokoka said fencing of graveyards will be put in the next budget. “When graveyards are fenced, people tend to steal the fence. They also open holes on the fence to use as a short cut into the graveyard. We ask them to refrain from that bad habit.” She said owners should look after their donkeys, and ensure that they’re e driven to the bush for grazing.
