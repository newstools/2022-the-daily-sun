Now that the first part of Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s commission report has been handed over to President Cyril Ramaphosa, all eyes will be on the president to see what cause of action he’ll take. I am curious on the disciplinary action to be handed down to all the wrongdoers implicated in the report. What the president will do is anyone’s guess. Will the looters of state coffers face the music or will he save his comrades from prosecution? Only time will tell. But since Ramaphosa said he would eradicate corruption in government, I believe and hope he will do the right thing and haul all perpetrators before the court of law. And former president Jacob Zuma must not be left behind. In fact, he must be the first to take the stand. This will show that Ramaphosa is a man of his word. Corruption is the reason our country does not prosper and why there are so many service delivery protests. Jobs will never be created because the money that is supposed to be used for job creation is being pocketed by crooked politicians. Corruption is taking our country backwards. We deserve better from our government. It should fulfil on its promise to improve the lives of all citizens. It’s been long since this promise was made. Now is time to practise what has been preached since democracy and turn words into action. Words don’t mean anything if they are not followed by proper action. Yes, not everyone will be employed, but let the majority get jobs. By so doing, at least many people will be able to provide for their families. Lastly, I wish every SunLander a happy and prosperous New Year. May the Lord bless all of you so your dreams can come true.
