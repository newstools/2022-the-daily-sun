PREMIER Soccer League prosecutor Zola Majavu confirmed Golden Arrows have been charged for fielding an ineligible player, Simo Mbhele, although the club have pleaded not guilty. However, judgement on the matter has been reserved. “The charges levelled against Golden Arrows, arising (for) fielding what we contend to be ineligible player Mr Simo Brighton Mbhele. That matter was argued fully before the DC and judgement has been reserved,” said Majavu. “As soon as judgement has been handed down by the DC, I will communicate it.” Arrows are alleged to have registered Mbhele without an international clearance certificate (ITC) which was supposed to have been sent to Arrows by the Portuguese Football Association where he was previously playing. Mbhele was playing for Portuguese side 1º Dezembro in one of the Portuguese lower leagues. Arrows thought there was a loophole to sign him and they don’t need an ITC clearance to be issued to them.   But Fifa rules are clear. They say a player, whether from South Africa or elsewhere as long as he was playing abroad, needs to have ITC issued from his previous club before he can play for his new club. Apparently, Mbhele was just training with Arrows to keep himself fit before he returned to Portugal but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he couldn’t travel abroad to rejoin his club.That’s when Arrows decided to sign him, but allegedly without the proper documents. Mbhele played in the wins over Maritzburg United and Marumo Gallants, draws against TS Galaxy, AmaZulu and Sekhukhune United, plus the defeats against SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns.The club could now lose the nine points gained in those matches and face a fine. That would see Arrows plummet down to 13th on the DStv Premiership table and into the relegation mix. SunSport has also learnt that the matter is also in the hands of Fifa, and Arrows could face more sanctions if they are found guilty.
