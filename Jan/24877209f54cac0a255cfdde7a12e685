PUBLIC Works Patricia De Lille says there is no plan in place to move Parliament from Cape Town to elsewhere in the country. She said this on Monday, 3 January as she addressed some calls from various people, including the EFF, calling for Parliament to be moved to Pretoria. De Lille said: “The issue of Parliament being moved, this has been ongoing I think for the past 10 to 15 years and no final decision was taken to move Parliament to another centre. “When I became the minister I said to cabinet that, to enable the consideration of moving the seat of Parliament to anywhere else in the country, the Constitution says it must be done through an Act of Parliament and there’s no Act of Parliament as yet,” said De Lille. The EFF said the fire incident is an opportunity for Parliament to do so. “Whatever money is going to be allocated immediately must be dedicated to relocating Parliament to Tshwane, where the Union Buildings reside to relieve the burden of government accommodation and costs. “But also, the move to Tshwane will allow us to do away with the Anglo-Boer War pact that was meant to share resources at the time of the establishment of the Union of South Africa at the exclusion of Africans,” said the EFF in a statement. The fire has been ongoing since Sunday morning and seemed to have been contained by Monday morning, but flared up late in the day at about 4pm. The City of Cape Town’s MMC for Safety and Security Jean-Pierre Smith said stronger winds ignited “the smouldering wood inside the roof void space, parts of which are not accessible for dousing or dampening”. The fire flared up on the fifth floor of the National Assembly, which then caused the roof to burn.
