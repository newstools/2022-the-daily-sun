KZN's MEC for Social Development, Nonhlanhla Khoza, is
urging residents to partner with cops in the fight against gender-based
violence. Khoza's call comes after a gogo from Amaoti in the north of
Durban was ganged-raped and ended up dying. The gogo passed away at a police station when she went to
report her ordeal on Wednesday. In the past, the same ruthless gang-raped the gogo and
escaped the law. It is believed the gogo's neighbours were aware that she was
turned into a sex slave by these heartless young boys, but no one reported the
matter to the law enforcement agencies. MEC Khoza pleaded with residents in the area to work closely
with the cops to arrest the gang of young boys involved in the rape. She expressed her
disgust that even the residents could not help the gogo to ensure the
perpetrators were brought to book. "It is disheartening that we have young people who rape
in our communities and are known, but we fail to report them to the police. We
want to see the police investigate the death of this senior citizen and ensure
perpetrators get arrested," Khoza said. The MEC dispatched teams of social workers to three bereaved
families to provide psycho-social support. Khoza said the violation of human dignity and human rights
has lasting consequences for the victims.
