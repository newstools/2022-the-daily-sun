NOTHING will please South African football fans during the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) more than to see Ghana suffer. That’s judging by the reaction from local football lovers to the Black Stars defeat in their opening Group C match against Morocco. Ghana were defeated 1-0 by the Atlas Lions at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo on Monday, much to the delight of Mzansi fans. Sofiane Boufal scored late in the second half to deliver a sucker punch to the Ghanaians who had been holding on for a point. The defeat pleased South Africans who still harbour a grudge against the Ghanaians following the infamous dubious penalty that knocked Bafana Bafana out of the World Cup qualifiers late last year. The South Africa Football Association (SAFA) complained to FIFA as they believed the officiating by Senegalese referee Maguette N’Diaye in that match was biased. But they were unsuccessful in having the game replayed. This, however, did not stop Mzansi fans from feeling robbed. And they continue to show their dislike for Ghana as a result of that ordeal. Ghana forgot to bribe the match officials today. unbelievable pic.twitter.com/37cSPOsRuF I’m so happy Ghana lost today South Africans ????let us gethering here lough at Ghana???????? pic.twitter.com/0xylYP02tu For Ghana ???? to Get knocked out in the Group stages #AFCON2021 ?? ??????????????
