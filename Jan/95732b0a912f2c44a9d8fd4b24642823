PASTORS’ Wives new cast member Tshidi Motlhose’s journey on the show hasn’t been easy. Tshidi, who is one of the three new cast members on the Honey TV reality series, said it took time to get used to the show and what was required of her. She, Judy Renoto and Noluvo Duna joined the ladies from the first season, Nandipha Mlombi, Phume Khethang, Anietie Ezeimo and Adeyola Da Costa for the second season. Tshidi, who is married to Pastor Ananias Tebogo Motlhose, spoke to SunBuzz about the show. “When viewers meet Tshidi, they should expect a person who knows she’s a newcomer. When I was coming into the show, that was the welcoming I got. I was shown that I’m a newcomer that’s coming into people’s space,” she said. “So, because of that, I was evaluating, trying to see who’s who, and who I can sit with. But now that I am used to the ladies, I’m going to rock,” she said. Tshidi said she joined the show because she is passionate about any cause that brings pastors’ wives together. “I’m into content production and I’m an emerging producer. One of the ideas I had was having a talk show about a pastors’ wives club where we come together and talk about our challenges,” said Tshidi. “When I was called to join Pastor’s Wives, I was busy preparing the talk show. and because it correlated with what I was planning on doing, I jumped on it,” she said. Tshidi said: “I hope to be part of the coming seasons because I want us to get to a stage where we speak about the real issues that pastors’ wives face and go deeper. I want us to expose our truth, especially from the African perspective – how people view and judge us.” Catch Pastors’ Wives on Honey TV (DStv channel 173) every Thursday at 5.30pm.
