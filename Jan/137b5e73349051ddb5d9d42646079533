KAITANO Tembo has never been shy to throw youngsters into the deep end. And more often than not, this has worked out well for the SuperSport United mentor in the past. The likes of Teboho Mokoena, Sipho Mbule, Jamie Webber, Luke Fleurs have been beneficiaries of Tembo’s fearless approach in introducing youngsters into his teams. They have all grown into consistent performers in recent seasons for Matsatsantsa a Pitori, with Mokoena also breaking into the Bafana Bafana setup. Fleurs is also knocking on the Bafana door, while Mbule is widely considered as one of the most naturally gifted players in the country. Tembo is now looking to turn a new group of youngsters into important players for United, as he faces the reality of losing some of his stars such as Mokoena and Mbule. The Zimbabwean mentor has been forced to fast track the progress of the likes of Selaelo Rasebotja, Thalente Mbatha, Ryan Manning, Oswin Appollis, Tendamudzimu Mutodzi and Gape Moralo. Mbatha, a talented 21-year-old midfielder, has impressed Tembo in the handful of appearances he’s made so far this season. “We know what he can do. That is why we’ve had the confidence to play him,” said Tembo. “We believe in him and that is why he is part of the group. We will continue to bring in a few youngsters who are already training with the first team. “There’s also Rasebotja, he is another midfielder who plays for our Diski Challenge team. So, those are the players we are looking at giving game time to prepare them for next season.” Tembo’s United have been stretched this season with injuries, suspensions and Covid-19 testing the depth of their squad. And this has somewhat affected their performances, currently occupying sixth spot in the DStv Premiership standings with 26 points from 17 matches played.
