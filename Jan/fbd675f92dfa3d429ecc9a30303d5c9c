A MAN (34) who was allegedly a gangster has been killed by an angry crowd. The man was beaten to death in Rooiboklaagte outside Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Saturday, 29 January at 8pm. Fuming residents caught up with the man and moered him. When police arrived at the scene the crowd had already vanished. Cops found the bloodied man lying unconscious with bruises all over his body. Medical personnel were called to the scene, but it was already too late and they certified him dead. “We are sick and tired of these gangsters going around terrorising us,” shouted one of the residents. “They rob us, rape defenceless women and break into people’s houses.” Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said: “The police have launched a manhunt for murder suspects following an incident regarding a mob attack. The deceased was assaulted by community members who alleged that the victim is one of the gangsters that are terrorising people around their area.” Anyone with information can contact the Acornhoek Police acting branch commander Captain Tabodi Sekgobela on 083 206 6316.
