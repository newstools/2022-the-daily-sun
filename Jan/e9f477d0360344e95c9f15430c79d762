Her post read: “This part of my life is very hard, very very hard. I’ve felt every horrible emotion one can ever imagine. “As I type this I’m in tears as I’m that generation breaking the worst curses in my family lineage and it’s not easy. In fact, my mere existence is making the devil fight me in very important parts of my life: financial, friendships, finding a good man, good health in my family etcetera, but still I stand in prayer and faith that I’m the chosen one.” ALSO READ | VUYO ENTANGLED IN NEW ROLE But despite all the attacks she would not be defeated. “My mother said to me, ‘Lele, don’t let the devil deter you from what is destined for you’.
