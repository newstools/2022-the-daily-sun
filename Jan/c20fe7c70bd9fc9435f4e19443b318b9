 THE South African National Defence Force (SANDF) insists no foul play was involved in a fire that broke out at the Waterkloof Air Force Base in Tshwane on Sunday, 23 January. Brigadier-General Andries Mahapa said it was a restricted military area and crimes could not be committed without being detected. He said the cause of the fire was being investigated and assured Mzansi all was in safe hands. The SANDF said fuel tankers were suspected to have caught fire. It claimed it probably started because of a burst pump. “It started at the bulk fuel tanks. There is no clarity on how the fire started and no indication whether it was underground or on the surface. Investigations continue.” Mahapa said the fire was contained within an hour. Tshwane Emergency Services said a 24 000 litre fuel tank caught fire, but the contents were unknown to City Fire Services. Emergency Management Services spokesman Ronald Hendricks said according to the air force, they didn’t need to call the municipality. “However, we responded from the nearest station in Centurion to assist in the event the situation escalated. City resources were not required as the fire was already extinguished,” said Hendricks.
