SA Football Association (Safa) head of competitions, Moremi Klip, has confirmed the Sasol League Women’s Championship play-offs will now take place in Durban from 25-30 January. The week-long tournament was scheduled for 6-12 December, but postponed in the wake of the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron. There will not be many changes as Klip also confirmed the competition will take place at Durban’s Princess Magogo and King Zwelithini Stadium, as was planned last year. Last year, Safa said they would engage the government to have fans for the tournament’s final match, but this time around, they will not. Klip said: “The players will have to produce a negative (Covid-19) test result to join the bio-bubble camp. No fans will be allowed to attend the matches.” The nine provincial teams will be battling for a cool R200 000 cash prize, while the runners-up will pocket R100 000, and both will earn promotion to the Super League. The third-placed side gets the R60 000 consolation prize. In a draw that was made in November, the KZN Sasol League champions Lindelani Ladies were pitted in Group C alongside Ixias (FC Free State) and Copperbelt Ladies (Limpopo). Group B has the likes of TD Galaxy (Mpumalanga), Tswelelang De’Scorpions (North West) and Croesus Ladies (Gauteng). Group A consists of City Lady (Eastern Cape), Royal Wizards (Northern Cape) and Vasco Da Gama Ladies (Western Cape).
