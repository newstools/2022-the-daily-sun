THE driver of a Cadillac drove through the front door of a bottle store in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The driver, a 54-year-old man with alleged mob connections who was once convicted in a Revere slaying in 1996, appeared to be unharmed after the crash. He was certainly well enough to get out of the car, walk into the store, and help himself to some chips and booze before the cops arrived. Stoneham police told CBS Boston that they were initially called to the store for a report of a burglary alarm. Once they arrived on the scene, they saw the car crashed into the store and located the man inside, near the cash registers, smoking his cigar. Police say that he told them that he had a gun and “said that they needed to shoot him while waving behind his back to his waistline.” Cops did not shoot and instead tasered him. Despite that, he fought them off and hit an officer in the face before they could place him in handcuffs. According to Carscoops, as a result, he now faces charges of breaking and entering, assault and battery of a police officer, and more.
