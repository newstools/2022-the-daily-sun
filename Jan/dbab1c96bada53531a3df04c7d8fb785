DEAN Elgar played a captain’s knock to lead the Proteas to an impressive seven wicket win over India at the Wanderers in the second Test. The skipper scored 96 runs in the second innings to ensure his team level the series at one-all heading into the final Test match at Newlands, Cape Town next week. He finished unbeaten as the Proteas clinched victory with a day to spare. Themba Bavuma, the vice-captain, was at the other end as Elgar hit the winning runs. Bavuma maintained his good form in the series so far, ending with 23 runs not out. The Proteas began the day needing 122 runs but Elgar and Rassie Van Der Dussen went about eating away at that total. This was after rain had delayed the start of the fourth day. Van Der Dussen scored a quickfire 40 that turned the game in South Africa’s favour when play finally resumed. 240 was the highest score the Proteas have managed to chase down at the Wanderers.
