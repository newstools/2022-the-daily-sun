THREE days
after their “perfect wedding”, a groom stabbed his new bride to death in a
brutal knife attack. The former
Russian army soldier reportedly killed his 
21-year-old wife, then turned on her cousin (18) and killed her with a
pair of scissors. The Mirror
reports that cops later found him in a car with firearms and fatal gunshot
wounds after taking his own life. The groom
had left his bride the day after their wedding to spend time with a 64-year-old
massage therapist outside his village, whom he had previously visited. A fight
erupted between them after he “refused to pay for intimate services”, according
to a police report. “They had
an argument after which the client raped the woman,” read the report. He returned
home “drunk” the same day and early on Sunday, his wife and her cousin were
found dead in the house in Melekes village in Russia’s central state of
Tatarstan. The husband
then allegedly opened a safe in the house which belonged to his father, and
took two hunting rifles before driving off.
