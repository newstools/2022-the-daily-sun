BROADCASTER SABC’s head of marketing Themba Gwejela has warned against scammers who want followers using the SABC as bait. This comes after tweeps have been asking social media users to follow them claiming they applied for jobs at the SABC and that a huge following was a requirement. It was started by a tweep who said they applied for a job at Umhlobo Wenene FM and needed a lot of followers to get it. “I’m begging you guys to follow me. I have applied for a radio presenter position at SABC (Umhlobo Wenene FM). Large following is a requirement. Please follow and I’ll follow back,” wrote the tweep. The post was shared on both Facebook and Twitter, with some questioning the new requirement by the radio station, while others were pushing for her to get more followers. Soon after, similar tweets were posted by others claiming they also applied for jobs and need followers.

Taking to Twitter, Gwejela said SABC does not ask potential employees to have a big social media following. And he said everyone who is asking for followers is misleading people. “Please note that the SABC does not ask potential employees or on-air talent to campaign for big social media following. There is no such requirement for joining the SABC. Anyone asking you to help them get followers for a ‘job’ at the SABC is misleading you,” he wrote.
