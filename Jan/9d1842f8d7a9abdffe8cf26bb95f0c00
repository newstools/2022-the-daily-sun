TUESDAY, 18 January was a sad day for fish paste lovers as Pioneer Foods announced that it was ending the production of Pecks Anchovette and Redro Fish Paste in South Africa. The company said it chose to stop making fish paste products towards the end of last year as part an “ongoing portfolio review”. “We communicated this to our customers, stopped production and discontinued the sale of related items in December 2021,” the company was quoted on Business Insider. “Products will therefore remain available for purchase by consumers, as long as retailers have stock on hand. We are in the process of finalising the sale of related assets/brands to a third party.” Taking to Twitter, fish paste lovers expressed their sadness at the news. “I woke up feeling so good, only to be informed that fish paste is being discontinued. I’m already over 2022,” @lana_helberg wrote. I woke up feeling SO good…only to be informed that they’re discontinuing Fish Paste….I’m already over 2022 ????  Another consumer @BronyW wrote: “Very sad to see that Pecks Anchovette has been discontinued in SA along with Redro, that will no longer be manufactured. This product has been around since 1891.” Very sad to see that Pecks Anchovette has been discontinued in SA along with Redro which will no longer be manufactured. A product that has been around since 1891https://t.co/4Vn14PO0yE Some paste lovers went to stock up before the products completely run in stores and online. My Precious!
