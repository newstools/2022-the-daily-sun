GOGO Alice Masiya (75), who survived miraculously after being buried under rubble when her house wall and roof collapsed on her, has died. The dark cloud of her death settled on the homeless family from Malubane Village outside Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Monday, 24 January. This comes after the family has been healing through counselling from Calcutta Victim and Empowerment Programme Social Worker, Nokuthula Mashaba. Gogo Alice’s daughter, Marry Malamule (35) said they received a call from the nearby Matikwana Hospital that their mum has died. “She was admitted to the hospital on Sunday evening complaining of hypertension and severe pains in the chest and stomach,” she said. “We don’t know where to start as we have nothing to arrange her funeral.” Neighbour Buyisile Ndlovu (57) said: “We are doing affidavits to have her relocated from the government mortuary. “It is very difficult as gogo was from Mozambique, and didn’t have an ID.” She said they were pleading with Good Samaritans to assist them with donations towards the funeral. They also need a house for the kids and eight grandkids. The municipality has provided them with a tent and sponge mattresses only. On 10 January, gogo Alice had just finished taking a bath and was resting on her mattress on the floor at her garage when the walls and roof collapsed and buried her under the rubble for almost 20 minutes. Councillor Bio Mpangane and Community Development Worker Sibongile Ndlovu came to her aid and rushed her to hospital. Gogo was treated for head and leg injuries and later discharged. Mpangane said: “We know what the family is going through. They also informed us that magogo is no more and are now struggling financially with her funeral. So we are engaging Community Development as well as the social workers.”
