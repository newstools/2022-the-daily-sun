MPUMALANGA police have launched a manhunt for a gang of
heavily armed tsotsis who robbed a Sunbake Bakery facility, getting away with
cash, firearms and a company car in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Thursday, 6
January. The incident took place at around 11.30pm. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said: "Security officers were
patrolling the premises around Sunbake Bakery when about eight armed suspects
stormed in and found security officers parked their bakkie at the gate en route
to Nelspruit. "The suspects then held the guards at gunpoint and
robbed them of their firearms and further instructed them to open the gate.” Mohlala said all
security guards were reportedly locked in an office while the suspects broke
the cash office and detonated some explosives to force open the safe. They took
an undisclosed amount of cash and further robbed them of their Bidvest company
Bidvest Toyota bakkie with the registration No. TY 74 FS GP and fled the scene
in the direction of Hazyview. "The police were
informed, and a case of business robbery was opened. No arrest has been made as
yet," he said. Mpumalanga Police Commissioner Lieutenant - General
