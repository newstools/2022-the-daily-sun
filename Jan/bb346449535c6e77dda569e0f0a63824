WHEN Sibusiso Nxumalo lost his job four years ago, he was devastated. However, he never stopped looking for work. But when he realised that finding a job was difficult, the 37-year-old father of one from Rockville in Soweto decided to wash blankets for a living. He told Daily Sun he started by washing his mum’s blankets and she gave him R50 per blanket. “My mother was very impressed with my work, so I let my neighbours know I’m doing this kind of job. “Everyone was happy whenever I rendered my services and this is how my business grew. I also decided to wash carpets and bins,” he said. Sibusiso said he charged R100 per month to clean bins, and R100 to wash a blanket and R100 for big carpets. Like any other business, he has also experienced challenges, but these did not stop him from going forward. “I’ve had clients who had problems paying, but I’m a patient man who knows how to work with people. I negotiate so that I can get the money,” he said. Sibusiso encouraged unemployed South Africans to put their pride aside and work. “That’s your money and no person will stand up for you if you don’t,” he said. Sibusiso said he’s aware of people negatively criticising his work, but he’s not bothered as he has worked hard to get to where he is.
