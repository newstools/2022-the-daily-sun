GLORIA Bosman has been praised by fellow jazz singer Sbongile Mngoma. In a heartfelt message, Sbongile outlined how Gloria prayed for her when she was facing tough times during a UK tour. She thanked Gloria for ensuring she was safe. In a brief message, she wrote: “I want to say this while I’m still alive and she is still alive. Gloria prayed me back from the edge during the very difficult Porgy and Bess Tour in the UK. Her and Otto Maidi prayed me sober and healthy. Even afterwards, she held on and made sure the hyenas never get me again. Artists go through a lot. I say this from personal experience. I know everyone has a lot on their plate and also go through the most. I’m just speaking out for my fellow artists, because we are not always taken seriously. But we are also human and we go through a lot. Thank you Noskhumbuzo. Ungadinwa nangomso. Blessings baby.” ALSO READ : JESO!
