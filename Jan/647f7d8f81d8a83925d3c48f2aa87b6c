SUPERSPORT United reserve team coach, Thabo September, hopes to see his DStv Diski Challenge side finish the season in the top four following the return of 12 players to full training after the matric exams and results. The young Matsatsantsa a Pitori are currently seventh on the log with 21 points after 14 games. September said they failed to collect more points in the first half of the season due to players having to balance schoolwork and football. He said: “We went past the challenge of matric. We had 12 learners in matric and they passed, and we won’t have this challenge again. They can (now) focus fully on football.” Matsatsantsa a Pitori managed to win six of their last 14 games, drew three and lost five. “We dominated all the games we played except for the 2-0 loss away at Chippa United. Players were training once a week and that affected them. “We plan to win the last 16 games and the target will be finishing in the top four,” he said. September’s boys’ hosts DDC debutants Marumo Gallants at Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium on Saturday (noon). The coach will have to play wingers at left and right-back following injuries sustained by the full backs. “We don’t have a natural left back. Our left-back is injured, so we are using Modimooarabetse Moeti who is a left-wing in that position. “We will have two wingers playing at the back this weekend, but I feel it’s good that they can be versatile at a young age,” he said. He believes that having players play out of position prepares them for the challenges that they might face when they get promoted to the first team. “It helps them grow as players so that when they get into the space of the PSL they know exactly what is expected of a certain position and they will deliver,” added September.
