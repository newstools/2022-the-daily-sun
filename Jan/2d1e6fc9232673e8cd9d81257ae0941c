IN SEPTEMBER last year, Daily Sun published the story of a gogo whose house was damaged by an alleged drunk driver. However, gogo Nosiphiwo Ndlwana (71) from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, is smiling again as the driver has fixed her home. The Hyundai H1 that crashed into her house destroyed her kitchen, damaging her washing machine, fridge, cupboards and stove. The gogo said she begged the owner of the car to help for months and in December, they started rebuilding her house. “Though I’m angry they took their precious time, I’m grateful they replaced all the damaged items.” The gogo urged boozers to stop driving when drunk. She thanked Democratic Alliance councillor Thulani Dasa for supporting her. “He played a huge role because he contacted the owner of the car. Daily Sun also played a part.” Dasa said although he was happy the house was fixed, he was disappointed it took so long.
