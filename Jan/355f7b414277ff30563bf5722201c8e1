With just a few days to go
before the DStv Compact Cup kicks off, the stage is perfectly set for
youngsters of the DStv Diski Challenge to showcase their talent. Warriors FC, have the exciting
Mduduzi Shabalala of Kaizer Chiefs who has been in fine form this season with
twelve goals to his name and a recent national team call-up. Coastal United have the
exciting Thulani Mini in their arsenal. The 19-year-old Chippa United forward
is enjoying a rich vein of form, which is coupled with six goals so far. Dinaledi FC have the explosive
Sibusiso Nkosi from Marumo Gallants, who can be a handful for any defence if
not monitored closely in the DStv Compact Cup. Looking at Amabutho, Samkelo
Mzolo of Golden Arrows is proving to be a good future prospect, displaying
qualities of a good striker at a very young age. Catch all the Compact Cup
