KIDS between the ages of 12 and 14 shocked many residents when they celebrated New Year’s Day by getting drunk! The kids from Hombe Village in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, ran into the SunTeam while carrying a bucket of traditional beer and other booze. One of the kids told Daily Sun: “We got the money to buy alcohol from our parents and we are enjoying ourselves.” Another child said his mum knew he drank alcohol on public holidays. “My mum usually gives me R100 and I will contribute it to my friends when we buy booze.” The kids told the SunTeam after drinking, they went home to sleep. One of the kids said: “We do not do anything bad after drinking. “This is not our first time. Last year, we did the same thing and some residents told our parents we didn’t cause any trouble, meaning they don’t care if we drink.” The kids said they got traditional beer from their friends’ parents. One boy said: “My mum always makes traditional beer during this time. She won’t even notice if I steal some because everyone is happy and not stingy at this time of the year.” But a resident said the parents didn’t realise they were killing their kids. “I don’t understand parents who give their kids money during this time of the year when everything they need is at home. “What are they hoping to achieve when they give their kids R100 or R200?” said the concerned resident.
