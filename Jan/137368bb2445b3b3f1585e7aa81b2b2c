KHOLEKA Qwesha wants to be a cop. But this has not been possible, thanks to a criminal record she got after she fought with her boyfriend in 2010. The 51-year-old from Khayelitsha in Cape Town said her boyfriend, who has since died, opened a case against her, but she paid an admission of guilt fine. She later broke up with the man. But when Kholeka applied to become a cop, she was told she has a criminal record and didn’t qualify. She then applied for expungement and her police clearance from the Criminal Record Centre shows she is “clean”. She applied for a police clearance twice and the results came saying she doesn’t have a criminal record, but whenever she applies to be a cop, the criminal record pops up. Kholeka, who has been a police volunteer at Harare SAPS in Khayelitsha since 2006, said this has ruined her dreams of being a cop. “What angers me a lot is that the same system that clears me is the same system that is being used to stop me from being a cop. I think police management should have something manual to help me considering that this is their system’s fault,” she said. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said Kholeka should follow internal processes. “All our members are acquainted with the SAPS grievance procedures and she’s encouraged to make use of the platforms available to her to seek a favourable outcome.”
