SA Rugby Union (Saru) director, Rassie Erasmus,was excited to be back at work on Monday after his two month ban by World Rugby ended. While he is back at work, the outspoken former Bok coach will not be part of the Springboks three Test matches in July against Wales in Mzansi, but will be back to help the Boks after 30 September. Erasmus, who coached the Boks to victory in the 2019 World Cup final in Japan, was slapped with a ban by World Rugby in November for two months for all rugby activities and also banned from all match-day activities (including coaching, contact with match officials, and media engagement) with immediate effect until 30 September 2022. Erasmus set tongues wagging when he lashed out at Australian referee Nic Berry after the first Test match of the British and Irish Lions series in Cape Town in July. He highlighted over 26 incidents that went against the Boks, which were not penalised by Berry. Since his suspension, Erasmus has taken time to engage with his fans on his Twitter, with plenty of fun videos along with his dog Frank and hitting out at English Rugby Board, World Rugby and their president Bill Beaumont. Erasmus, who was allowed to be a water carrier during the Lions series is looking forward to be back in what will be defining year for the Boks with World Cup in sight next year. “My daughters seemed to be happier than me to go back to work!” said Erasmus on Twitter in a video he shared with his three daughters. Although the Boks remained number one in the world rankings, they have a few kinks to iron out and one of them is to renew the ageing squad that showed flaws during the Rugby Championship. My daughters seem to be more happier than me to go back to work!! On a serious note!! The last part of their chat I fully agree with ???? pic.twitter.com/QgwI7HTgGI
