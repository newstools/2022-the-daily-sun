ALTHOUGH Covid-19 regulations were relaxed on Thursday, 30 December, these councillors are not letting their guard down. On Friday, North West councillors gathered on the Soutpan Road between Hammanskraal and Moretele to get their vaccine booster shots. Moretele municipal chief whip Nkele Mleta said she received a J&J booster. She said although she was vaccinated in October and six months had not passed yet, she believed it was wise to get a booster now. “We are running the Arrive Alive campaign with health department officials and we encourage residents to get their vaccination. Let’s go out and fully vaccinate and those who still need booster shots should do so,” she said. Mleta said the vaccine was designed to protect people from the disease and help their immune systems. She said she had no side effects from the vaccine. She said 15 councillors from the municipality got their boosters and were happy to do so. Councillor Steven Setshedi said it was important to tell others when you got vaccinated to encourage them to do the same. He said being fully vaccinated allowed him and his colleagues to do their jobs without fearing the virus. “Even though we’re vaccinated, we will continue following precautions and regulations,” he said.
