 A 34-YEAR-OLD man from Ga-Kuranta Village outside Bolobedu in Limpopo went on the rampage on Saturday night, 1 January. He shot and killed his cop wife and two other men in separate incidents. The 32-year-old wife was outside her house with a man, standing next to his white Ford Ranger when her 34-year-old husband approached them and fired several shots at them with his licensed firearm, killing them both instantly. The husband then fled the scene with the man’s car. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspect then reportedly found a 36-year-old male with a female friend, sitting inside a BMW vehicle. “He fatally shot the man, apparently on suspicion that he was in love with his wife. “The female friend was also shot but was taken to hospital for medical treatment.” The suspect then drove to Giyani Police Station using the Ranger and handed himself over to the police together with his licensed firearm and the hijacked motor vehicle. “He was arrested and placed in police custody. He will appear before Bolobedu Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 4 January, facing charges of three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and car hijacking,” said Mojapelo. Police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe has warned firearm owners of drastic measures if licensed firearms were used in serious crimes. Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale has condemned incidents of gender-based violence and femicide. She said the continuing cases of murder as a result of people fighting in their relationships must stop. “Ending another person’s life can never be a solution and people must find peaceful ways of resolving their differences,” she said. Rakgoale said they have sent teams of social workers to the two areas to provide psychosocial support to the affected parties.
