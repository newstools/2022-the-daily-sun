South Africa recently lost a global icon in Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Mpilo Tutu. People all over the world started to share with us all the good things that he did or said while he was still alive. Not a bad thing, indeed. However, my greatest concern about this is that people have a tendency of waiting until our heroes and heroines die before praising them. Judging from what I learnt, Tutu deserved great recognition while he was still on earth.
