I got it from my unborn child. At her funeral, as I stood at the podium speaking on my queen’s behalf, I was not alone. The strongest heart was beating inside of me, reviving me. I am alive because of it. My baby, you are your grandmother’s answered prayer. She was so excited to meet you. Even though you did not get to meet in the physical realm, I know she is currently holding you in the spiritual one,” she wrote. The excited mum-to-be said her unborn baby’s kicks and moves were a testament of God.
