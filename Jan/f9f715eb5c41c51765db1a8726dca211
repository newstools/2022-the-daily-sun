PERSISTENT heavy rain has left a trail of destruction in scores of houses, roads and bridges in parts of Mpumalanga. Devastated residents of Saselani outside Dwarsloop near Bushbuckridge were seen fixing up their homes, yards and access streets ruined by rain since Saturday, 8 January. In Gottenburg, Welverdiend, Allandale, Utah and Burlington in the Greater Manyeleti area, bridges and access roads were also swept away by the continuous heavy rain. Said Meriam Khosa: “The bridge and access roads have been washed away by this heavy rain. No taxis or buses are accessing our villages. We have to walk a kilometre through bushes to get them. We are calling Bushbuckridge Municipality to help us as the situation is getting worse.” Nomsa Nkosi (52) of Matafin outside Mbombela said they were left homeless after the heavy rain left their food, clothes and furniture as well as valuable documents soaking wet.  Ward Councillor Kenneth Mkhonto said: “Yes, I can confirm there’s serious damage caused by the heavy rain falling in Matafin and surroundings. Several families were left homeless after their houses were flooded away. The roads are also bad after being washed away by the rain. So disaster management and technical services teams from provincial offices and the Mbombela Municipality were activated and visited the affected families, as well as the roads to help them with aid and equipment.”  Bushbuckridge Municipality spokesman Claiton Khosa said: “We have received several reports on the issue. Once the persistent rainfall has subsided, the municipality with the assistance of the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport will embark on the resealing, regravelling and grading of internal streets and roads. We are urging members of the public to avoid flooded bridges, roads and streets.”
