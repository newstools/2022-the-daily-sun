 During patrols early in the morning in the Parklands area, a police officer noticed the owner of a local laundromat carrying a bag.  “The officer decided to investigate and went to the man,” said Captain Frederick van Wyk.  “He was arrested for being in possession of an illegal substance, dealing in an illegal substance and bribery. When counted it was confirmed that there were 1 000 Mandrax tablets in the plastic bag,” said Van Wyk.
