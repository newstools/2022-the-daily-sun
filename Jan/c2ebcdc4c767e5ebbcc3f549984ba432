Although experts are still learning a lot about Covid-19 vaccines, they have some clear benefits. If you’ve already received the vaccine, great job! Share these facts with others who might be hesitant. If you’re unsure of whether the vaccine is right for you or not, know that once you receive your first shot, your body begins producing antibodies. These antibodies help your immune system fight the virus if you were to get exposed, so it reduces your chances of getting the disease. It’s true that you can still get infected after being vaccinated. But once more of the population is vaccinated, those chances are further reduced. This is thanks to something called herd immunity. So, getting vaccinated not only reduces your chances of being infected, but also contributes to community protection, which reduces the likelihood of virus transmission. We even recently had a politician asking how one could get Covid-19 after being vaccinated. How is that a reality? These are people who claim to be leaders and want us to vote for them. Get educated and vaccinated – it’s the right thing to do. This letter wins our R200 prize. Call Nthabiseng to collect. – Deputy Editor
