JUST less than two weeks since the beginning of the 2022 academic year, pupils, teachers and staff at Phomolong Secondary School are mourning the death of their deputy principal. The 50-year-old woman was shot and killed outside the school gate on Friday, 21 January. It is reported that three gunmen appeared and allegedly shot her three times through the passenger window. In a statement by Gauteng Education, the victim then got out of her car trying to evade the hailstorm of bullets, but fell just beside it. “One of the gunmen allegedly shot her twice while she was on the ground, then they fled the scene without taking anything,” read the statement. It was unclear what might have led to the shooting, but unconfirmed reports suggested that she was shot, allegedly by a disgruntled pupil who had failed matric. Police are investigating. The department said the psychosocial unit would visit the school on Monday to offer counselling and support to those affected. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said: “We wish to convey our deepest condolences to the family and school community. Indeed, the motive of this cruelty is unknown, but I’m comforted that this case has been taken over by the provincial SAPS and as such, we are adamant that the perpetrators will be brought to justice.” Lesufi is scheduled to visit the school on Monday at 9am to further verify reports circulating on social media regarding the incident. Then he will proceed to the victim’s family.
