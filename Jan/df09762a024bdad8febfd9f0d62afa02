The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has lost another elected councillor, this time in eThekwini. Provincial ANC spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela confirmed to News24 the death of eThekwini ward 103 councillor Minenhle Mkhize on Saturday night. Ntombela said not much information was readily available to the ANC on Sunday morning as the party was headed to Mkhize's home.  Mkhize was a newly-elected councillor taking over the post following the municipal elections in November. News24 has reached out to KwaZulu-Natal police to get more information on the incident. Despite no clear motive for the incident, Mkhize's death is one of several killings involving politicians in the province over the years. The deaths of councillor candidates and violence were seen in the lead up to the municipal elections in 2021. Several by-elections will be held in KwaZulu-Natal in February.
