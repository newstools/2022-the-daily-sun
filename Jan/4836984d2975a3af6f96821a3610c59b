IT’S been a month now, and the residents of Tywaka Street in Philippi, Cape Town are still living with kak on their doorsteps. This is because municipal officials can’t enter the kasi to fix the pipes as they don’t have security escort. The residents said they reported the burst pipe for the first time on 16 December. “We spent Christmas surrounded by sewage. We are into the new year and we are still talking about the same old problem,” said Nomawethu Qumza. Resident Abongile Motswatswa (41) said the smell affected him badly at night when he tries to sleep. “At times it feels as if the kak is on my pillow. The life we have been living for the past few weeks makes me feel like I’m a prisoner,” he said. On Thursday, 13 January, ward councillor Bennett Payiya was on the street with workers from the municipality who were fixing the problem.  He said he had been asking them to fix the problem but they feared for their safety. “They told me they didn’t have law enforcement to escort them. That is why I’m here with them to ensure their safety,” he said. MMC for Water and Sanitation, councillor Zahid Badroodien said their first line response teams work in volatile communities and in some cases, they’ve had to arrange a law enforcement escort. “The City’s Law Enforcement has a large number of escort requests from officials and our service schedule depends on the safety and security department’s availability. A staff member was shot in this area while repairing a pipeline. Our teams have been victims of armed robbery on several occasions. “That is why it is difficult to respond to residents’ service delivery complaints,” he said.
