IT WAS a sombre mood inside the Hope Restoration Ministries on Thursday, 27 January, as family, friends, colleagues and pupils gathered to pay tribute to deputy principal Thembisile Ngendane (50). Supported by a friend and his relatives, husband Mbulelo Ngendane had his hand over his face. Distraught, he didn’t say a word. Family spokesman Yolo Ngendane said they were overwhelmed by the support and love they had been receiving from the community. “We appreciate the love and it keeps us going,” he said. The memorial service was held in Chloorkop near Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. Ngendane was shot dead last Friday while leaving the school. Two men approached her on foot while she was sitting in her car and shot her. ALSO READ |
PICS: TEARS FOR GIANT SHAI! She got out to run away from her attackers, but she collapsed. They then pumped her with even more bullets. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi and Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga visited the school to console both pupils and teachers on Monday and Tuesday. Pupils from Phomolong Secondary School paid tribute to their beloved teacher, who taught maths and geography. They read poems lamenting how soon she had left them. “I guess God knew, but you will always be in our hearts and lives. We promise we will make you proud,” read one of their messages. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said no one had yet been arrested, and that the police were still investigating. The funeral will be tomorrow.
