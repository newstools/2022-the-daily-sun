Imagine South Africa under the presidency of Julius Sello Malema. How would the country be under his leadership? Malema has the hallmarks of a dictator. No doubt, the country will be under a dictatorship. It is an open secret that the Economic Freedom Fighters’ leader has an ambition of becoming the South African president. And he will do anything and everything to realise his ambitious dream. Juju is a clever and shrewd politician, and he has been in this game for a long time. He is also charismatic and unapologetically speaks his mind. As a result, he appeals to the youth. Over the years, Malema targeted African National Congress presidents. So, at every given chance, he does not miss an opportunity to criticise and discredit them. Last week Saturday, the EFF held their Siyabonga rally in KZN. The party said it held the rally to thank its voters there. It is clear the EFF intends to increase its voter support in KZN. Whether he will realise his ambition or not remains unknown. Dismiss Malema at your own peril.
