COMMUNITY activist Samuel Shongoane has been afraid to leave his house since a rumour that he died started being spread on social media. The 25-year-old from Ga-Shongoane 3, outside Lephalale in Limpopo said he was still receiving RIP messages from friends to his phone. Samuel told Daily Sun he suspected there were people who wanted to see him dead because of his community work. He helps young people apply to university and for bursaries. He also collects sanitary pads and clothes for poor children every year, which he distributes to celebrate his birthday on 1 January. “They’re just jealous of what I do for the community. They want to completely destroy me. “I’m so sad because this false information was spread the day after I celebrated my birthday with needy children,” he said. “I was shocked when I got missed calls and messages from family and friends sending condolences. When I logged onto Facebook, I was shocked to see people saying I was dead. “I’m not dead, I’m alive and healthy.” Samuel said his parents didn’t want him to go out because people might think he’s a zombie or humiliate him. “He said if it didn’t blow over soon, he would open a case with the police. His sister Letia (27) said it has been difficult for the family as people had been visiting their house to check if the rumours were true. She said the spirit of death was hanging over the family. “We want to know who the person spreading this false information about my brother is. “People have been coming here to give messages of condolences but there has been no death,” she said.
