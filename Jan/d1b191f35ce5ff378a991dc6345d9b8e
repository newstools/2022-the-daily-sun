GLADAFRICA Championship side Pretoria Callies players have refused to report back to training as they are demanding their last year December salary. A source told SunSport that the Romans were scheduled to return to training from Festive Holidays this week. But the players have made it clear to club management that they want their salary first before they can report to work. “Imagine the pain of going home for Christmas without being paid,” said the source. “It was not a good holiday and now they (management) are expecting us to report back to training. We think it is time they start to think of us too. We are doing all we can for this club despite some conditions we are working under. How can you work with an empty stomach? We are not going to go to training until we get our salary.” A player who refused to be mentioned also sent SunSport a WhatsApp message from the club management after their last league match against Pretoria University on the 18th December saying: “Kindly note that there would be delays in the processing of your salaries of December 2021. You should expect your salary in two weeks from now. Pretoria Callies apologies for the inconvenience.” The Soshanguve-based outfit spokesperson, Doctor Maphalle said: “I don’t know anything about players not being paid their salaries or refusing to come to training. All I know is that we are opening next week on the 17th of January. The last time I spoke with the players was during our last league game against Tuks and we went for Holidays.” Last year, the struggling Callies was reported to be selling their Championship status to Limpopo-based side Turfloop as they were struggling financially. But the club rubbished those reports.Callies are currently in the relegation zone occupying 13th spot with 16 points from 17 league matches. This season, Callies have managed to win five matches, drew one and lost 11.They are only three points ahead of the bottom side Jomo Cosmos.
