THE Mvezo Komkhulu Welcome Centre in Mbhashe, Eastern Cape has burnt down. It was struck by lightning on Saturday, 8 January. Mvezo Komkhulu was meant to serve as a tourist attraction and also be used by local residents for business. The news was broken by King Zwelivelile Mandela via his Instagram page. In his post, he said: “Mvezo Komkhulu (The Great Place) Saturday 8th January 2022: The Mvezo Welcome Centre was struck by lightning today and its thatched roof caught fire resulting in the complete destruction of the centre. This was an act of nature and no foul play or any other cause is suspected. It is regrettable that we have lost this infrastructure, which was at an advanced stage of construction and R10 million was spent on the first phase and the lightning mast poles were not installed yet. The Mvezo Welcome Centre was funded through the National Lottery and a total of R17 million was committed of which R10 million was spent. We assure the local community and our development partner, the National Lottery, that no sabotage was involved and that the cause was beyond anyone’s control,” his post continued.  Zwelivelile’s post was accompanied by photos and a video of the centre engulfed by flames. His post attracted different opinions. Milton Nkosi posted: “Sorry. Thankfully no one was hurt. Reconstruction plans must begin soonest.” Queen shared: “Your ancestors are speaking.” A post shared by Nkosi Zwelivelile ?? (@nkosizwelivelile)  Lilia wrote: “Allah knows best. This reminds me that we were taught as kids that houses built from lottery money would eventually burn down.” Kaizer Khoza commented: “Oh so sorry, Nkosi. A thatched roof requires lighting conductor. Hope you all safe.”
