DESPITE facing court challenges and a dispute over the throne, King Misuzulu is continuing with his duties. The Zulu king is set to address amabutho at the commemoration of the Battle of Isandlwana in Nquthu, KZN, on Saturday, 22 January. This will be the third event he has had to do without the government’s funding. His funding has been frozen until the dispute over the throne between the king and Prince Simakade Zulu, which is being attended to by President Cyril Ramaphosa, is resolved. The king’s spokesman, Prince Thulani Zulu, told Daily Sun the battle in 1879 was an important moment in the country’s history. “The significance of Isandlwana continues to resonate with all generations as it entrenches the importance of heritage, determination and courage,” he said. The prince said this year’s commemoration came at a time when the entire world was fighting an invisible enemy, Covid-19. “His majesty humbly invites all media platforms to broadcast the speech as the masses won’t be in a position to attend due to the pandemic,” said Zulu. When Misuzulu was named king in 2021, the KZN government allocated money for cultural events but the funds were frozen after royal family members nominated Prince Simakade as king. Meanwhile, Ramaphosa and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s mediation committee has failed to get both factions to meet in one place. The committee is set to hand its recommendations over to the president for a final decision. The committee will meet both factions before the end of January to inform them of what its report will say before the president announces his decision.
