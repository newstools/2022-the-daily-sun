UKHOZI FM seems to be struggling to fill fired programmes manager Zandile Tembe’s post since October last year. Days after Tembe was axed for allegedly protecting a misbehaving presenter , the post was advertised. Failing to get suitable candidates from the SABC, Ukhozi re-advertised for external candidates, with the closing date of Monday, 17 January. Sources told Daily Sun the SABC was not satisfied with the internal applicants. “The SABC set aside all internal applications for the post and recommended it be re-advertised for external candidates,” a source said. Another source said Ukhozi staff who applied were disappointed not to get the job. “There was a legendary DJ who also holds a senior post who applied, but his application was dismissed.

There was one long-serving employee who also applied.” Head of radio drama, former Ukhozi FM DJ Mandla Mdletshe is acting programmes manager. Spokeswoman Gugu Ntuli said: “The SABC has readvertised the position of Ukhozi FM programmes manager for suitable external candidates to also compete for the crucial position. This is normal procedure when the internal process hasn’t yielded a positive outcome. The SABC will always strive to fill any vacant position with suitable candidates.”
