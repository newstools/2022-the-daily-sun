A WOMAN, who killed her mother in a drug-fuelled rage and hid her body under the stairs, has been sentenced to 17 years in jail. Cassandra Scott (36) stabbed her mum 10 times, and then left her body in the house they shared for almost three months. The 58-year-old had previously told cops that she was scared of her daughter and her temper. According to The Mirror, cops had previously been called out after Scott kicked her in the chest and punched her to the ground. A judge blasted the woman from Manchester, UK, for trying to “darken” her mum’s name, by claiming she had come at her with a knife. The judge added that Scott “grabbed” on her mum with a 21cm kitchen knife when she had her back turned. She then dragged her mum’s body from the grisly scene in the kitchen to a cupboard under the stairs, after wrapping it in plastic and covering it in bed sheets and curtains. She also tried to cover up the blood on the walls and floor with paint.
