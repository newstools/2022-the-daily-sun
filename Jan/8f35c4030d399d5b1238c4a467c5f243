IT seems that the beef between maskandi singer Khuzani Mpungose and former Ukhozi FM presenter Ngizwe Mchunu is far from over. They have been at each other’s throats since 2019. And a video, recently posted by Khuzani on Instagram, is evident of the never-ending rivalry. He posted a video, where he is seen dancing at his brother’s traditional wedding on Sunday, 26 December. He is also heard chanting the slogan: “I dreamt of a witch doctor.” The beef started after Khuzani filled up Moses Mabhida Stadium in 2019. He accused Ngizwe of participating in the arrival of his rival, singer Mthandeni Manqele, at his show – which caused drama. He also accused Ngizwe of bad-mouthing him.

Ngizwe said Khuzani told people to attend another show and snub his. He said he was aware of the video, but chose not to entertain Khuzani. “I don’t know what he wants from me. I helped to launch his career and now he thanks me with a plate of s**t. “Who have I bewitched? I’m not going to entertain him anymore.” Attorney S’the Ngubane said Ngizwe could sue Khuzani for defamation of character. “But it depends on how much damage was caused by being called a witch. “He must prove to the court that his life drastically changed after that.” Ngizwe insisted that he did not want to entertain Khuzani anymore, meaning he would not sue him.
