The
mutilated body of a man, found in the Roodeplaat Dam in Pretoria more than a
week ago, has been identified as Zeyn Khan. Khan was
reported missing at Florida police station on 29 November 2021, police
spokesperson Colonel Dimakatso Sello said on Thursday. Khan's body
was found last Monday after the Kameeldrift police received information that a
member of the public had seen someone dumping something into the dam from a
bridge. "She
[the eyewitness] notified the police, who immediately responded. Upon arrival
at the said place, the police discovered a frozen body wrapped in a plastic
bag. The body was mutilated, with the head, arms, legs and private parts
missing," Sello said at the time. Police are
investigating a case of murder. Anyone with
information that can assist with the investigation was asked to contact Captain
Cloete of Kameeldrift Detectives on 082 822 6962 or the Crime Stop Line at
08600 10111; alternatively, tip-offs can be left anonymously on MySaps App,
which can be downloaded on any smartphone. Editor's
