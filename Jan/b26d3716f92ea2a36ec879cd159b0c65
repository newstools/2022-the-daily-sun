AN ANC councillor appeared in court for the murder of a pub bouncer on Tuesday, 18 January. Knowledge Kushata (28) was stabbed to death during a fight at Khehla’s Place in Delmas, Mpumalanga, on Sunday, 16 January. Councillor Moses Mofomme (46) was arrested along with Eric Mahlangu (21), Kamogelo Moulameli (37) and Sibusiso Buda (37) on Monday, 17 January. They are expected back in the Delmas Magistrates Court on Monday, 24 January for a formal bail application. They are facing charges of assault, attempted murder and murder. Knowledge’s brother Frank Kushata said it was his brother’s first day at work. “My brother was killed like a dog,” he said. A worker at the pub said a fight between two groups of men started in the early hours of Sunday morning. The bouncers asked them to leave and allegedly were attacked. “We saw bottles and fists flying. It was chaos. People had to run for their lives,” he said. Another worker said in December, the same men threatened to stab and shoot the bouncers after they wouldn’t let them in with their bottles of Hennessy. “We didn’t take the threats seriously but on Sunday, they started fighting again. They threw bottles at us and left the victim in a pool of blood. They stabbed other workers. I never thought reprimanding them would lead to this.” Nkangala ANC secretary Sello Matshoga said the party condemned the incident. “In terms of the ANC’s constitution and policy, this means the councillor is automatically suspended. “The ANC will deal with this,” said Matshoga.
