STRAY cows and goats are constantly roaming the streets of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. They also walk around shopping malls and even snatch food from street vendors. When night falls, the animals destroy fences to feed on fruit and vegetables in residents’ homes in Dwarsloop, Mkhuhlu and Thulamahashe kasis. Motorist Paul Mathebula (49) said: “These cows sleep in the middle of the road. They like the tarred road for warmth, so it is dangerous when you are speeding as they are not easily visible at night.” Taxi driver Shane Ndlovu said: “Our passengers sometimes arrive late to work because of the cows. “They obstruct the road. Other drivers sjambok them. Our main challenge is that no one comes forward to take responsibility for damages when there is an accident.” ALSO READ | WATCH: 18-WHEELER TRUCK
CRASH INTO JAGUAR! Street vendor Shirley Shai (46) said: “They steal and eat our fruit and mielies, even pap. They are from nearby villages and their owners don’t even care. I have run a loss in the past couple of months because of the roaming cows.” Resident Tsakani Malope (52) said: “The goats ate my tomatoes and cabbages. I’m left with nothing. My kids are now starving.” Bushbuckridge Municipality spokesman Claiton Khosa said: “The issue of stray cows and goats will be addressed in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture.”
