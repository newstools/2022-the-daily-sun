ELIAS Maila (59) sleeps with one eye open because he’s scared the roof of his burnt house will cave in on him. Elias from Soshanguve, Tshwane has had the longest two weeks of his life after his house mysteriously burnt on 21 December. He was at a friend’s house when his neighbour called to say his house was on fire. Elias rushed home and when he got there he found people trying to put it out but the flames were too strong. “I watched in despair as the fire ate away everything I worked for.” By the look of things the fire began in his bedroom, but he was not sure what could’ve caused the fire. He said his car was also mysteriously destroyed by fire a year ago. “I believe the ancestors are trying to punish me because my car got burnt because after buying it, I didn’t take it to my ancestors’ grave. I’m looking look for answers.” Since the fire, he has been forced to sleep in the dilapidated house. “I’m relying on my friends for clothes and food. The municipality gave me a single-bed mattress and blankets just so I’ve got something to sleep on,” he said. Elias has no money to rebuild or even fix the roof because he is unemployed. He hopes a Good Samaritan will assist him. “I went to hardware stores to ask for donations, but they also couldn’t help,” he said Swazi Mbokane from the civil society said they were trying to help him. She was worried about Elias because he was not working. “ I’m appealing to anyone who can help him. He really needs help,” she said.
