WARRIORS, under Swallows coach Dylan Kerr, will face Steve Barker's Coastal United in the DStv Compact Cup final at FNB Stadium on Saturday. This after Warriors beat Amabutho 2-1 in the second semi final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Amabutho’s goals were scored by Sithebe, an own goal, and Monnapule Saleng later in the match. For Amabutho it was goal by Nkosinathi Sibisi. Earlier on the day, Coastal, under coach Stellenbosch FC coach Steve Barker, thumped Dan Malesela’s Dinaledi by 3-0 in the other semi final at the same venue. However, Warriors will be thankful to Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune, as he was kept busy despite having seen little action for his club this season. He pulled off a number of saves, first in 19th minute, when Golden Arrows winger Pule Mmodi’s thumping strike. Amabutho kept on coming and Khune was again called on into action, but once again reminded many of his qualities, stretching his leg to deny Mmodi’s shot in the 29th minute. Amabutho’s captain Makhehleni Makhaula was almost caught in playing a back pass. He wasn’t aware of his surroundings when he opted for a back pass to his goalie Veli Mothwa, but the danger was cleared as Kwame Peprah was looking to pounce. However, Amabutho’s Sithebe, heavily linked with Kaizer Chiefs from his club AmaZulu, unintentionally scored an own goal when he was trying to play a back pass in the 50th minute. It was bad miscommunication between him and Mothwa. However, Sibisi equaliser as he bundled home in the 69th minute after Warriors’ defence was caught flat. Khune was hapless on that occasion as he firstly denied Lelethu Skelem from close range. However, Swallows midfielder Saleng produced an unerring finish for Warriors, catching the ball with the laces to blast it at far post to beat Mothwa.
