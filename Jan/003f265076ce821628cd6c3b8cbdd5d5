THE Nombakuse family in Leiden, Delft in Cape Town, is looking for Mzukisi Nombakuse (43) who went missing on Saturday, 22 January. Family member Amahle Nombakuse said Mzukisi went outside for a few seconds. When they realised he was missing, they started searching for him. Mzukisi was wearing black shorts and a black T-shirt. “He is mentally disturbed and cannot speak,” said Amahle. “We ask that anyone who sees him must take him to the nearest police station. “We are afraid of what might happen to him,” she said. Amahle said they reported him missing at the Delft Police Station and they have also been searching in and around Delft. “We urge people, especially in Cape Town, to help us in searching for our brother,” said Amahle. Captain Frederick Van Wyk confirmed that a missing person’s inquiry was recorded in Delft on Saturday. “The Delft Crime Investigation Department is investigating the missing person,” said Van Wyk. Delft resident Kungawo Mntwini (40) said they will be on the lookout for him. “I hope he won’t get into people’s yards and be mistaken for a thief. I pray that he is safe wherever he is,” said Kungawo.
