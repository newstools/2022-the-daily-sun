Less than
two weeks ago, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula announced South Africa's
driving licence card machine was broken and in Germany to be fixed. Now, Mbalula
has released a video on social media of himself visiting the Driving Licence
Card Account (DLCA) - the national entity which produces driving licence cards
for the entire country. Earlier in
January, Wheels24 reported the machine had consequently broken in November
2021. Mbalula had said at the time: "The license machine is in Germany; it
has broken. I will be announcing temporary measures with regards to temporary
licences, but I am moving ahead with the new driving licence cards, which I
will announce in public." Mbalula
says in the video that the staff are pulling "day and night shifts"
to get South Africa's driving licence cards printed. He also says in the video
that some of the staff at the DLCA have been working there since 1998 - around
the time the print machine had initially been put in use. While the
machine being back in running order is good news, there has been a significant
backlog in driving licence renewals - at least more than 500 000 alone just in
Gauteng at the time when the print machine came to a halt. However, the backlog
had been growing long before then. The South African driving licence system has
long since been in peril and was only spotlighted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Gauteng motorists, and now some in the Eastern Cape, have been battling with
the online booking system known as Natis. According
to a press release issued in November 2021 by the Road Traffic Management
Corporation (RTMC), the backlog was close to 1.5-million two months ago: The RTMC
said: "The backlog of driving licence cards that expired between 26 March
2020 and 31 August 2021 is moving slowly. The backlog now stands at 1 476 853.
Gauteng accounts for 509 888 driving licence cards not yet renewed, followed by
KwaZulu Natal with 242 170, Western Province 192 519, Limpopo 134 886,
Mpumalanga 122 566, Eastern Cape 107 601, Free State 71 165, North West 69 350
and Northern Cape 26 708." We can only
imagine how these numbers have escalated in each province since mid-November.
Many motorists have emailed Wheels24 and said they have been waiting for their
driving licence cards for more than six months - long before the machine was
broken. Mbalula
says in the video during his visit to the DLCA on Tuesday (25 January) that he
will give further details of the machine and how it operates in his upcoming
address. OUTA CEO
Wayne Duvenage highlights the stress and dilemmas South Africans are going
through to obtain a driving licence card. "Motorists are being forced to
drive around with expired driving licence cards because they can't keep taking
days off work to go back and forth to the department," he notes. The Department
of Transport extended its grace period for driving licence cards that expired
in the lockdown last year, ending at the end of March 2022. The
Automobile Association told Wheels24: "It's great news that the printing
machine is up and running again, but we're extremely concerned about the
backlog. It's only obvious that the deadline for 31 March 2022 for lockdown
expired driving licences will once again be met, and this date will most likely
have to be extended again." SOURCE: WHEELS24
