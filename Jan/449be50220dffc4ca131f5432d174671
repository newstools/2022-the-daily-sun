FIVE Pikitup security guards were brutally shot and killed on Tuesday, 11 January when a group of men stormed the Swartkoppie Depot in Devland, south of Joburg. A total of seven guards were shot. Four died on the scene, one succumbed to injuries in hospital while two are fighting for their lives. The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) in Gauteng will be visiting the site on Thursday, 13 January. The union expressed shock and sadness and conveyed its condolences to the families of the deceased and wished those injured a speedy recovery. In a statement circumstances leading to the shooting are unknown. The workers were not robbed of their personal belongings nor has the City’s property been stolen. “As Samwu, we are concerned that workers who are supposed to protect the City’s infrastructure are themselves left vulnerable to attacks. To make matters worse, these workers are not provided with weapons to defend themselves and the City’s property. “We urge law enforcement agencies to ensure they leave no stone unturned as they hunt and bring to justice the perpetrators of such evil deeds which have robbed five families of breadwinners and many children without parents. “We further urge community members in and around Devland to work together with law enforcement authorities to ensure these criminals are brought to book.” The union also called on the community to come forward with information that could lead to the apprehension of the group who killed the guards.
