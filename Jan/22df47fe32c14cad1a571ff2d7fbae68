THE Makonza family needs help to find their daughter Esam. The 16-year-old from Ndlovini in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, went missing on Wednesday 19 January. Her mum Babalwa Makonza (37) told Daily Sun the grade 10 pupil at Mfundo High School left home to go to school and never returned. “She woke up in the morning to get ready to go to school. I last saw here when she was taking her little brother to school. “I later spoke to her friends and they told me she never arrived at school. They thought she had just decided not to go for the first day.” Babalwa said her daughter’s phone was off and she has been searching for Esam for days with no luck. “My daughter is not someone who would just up and go. I’m afraid something bad happened to her,” she said. Babalwa has been struggling to sleep since Wednesday. “I cannot sleep or eat because of this. There is a lot going on in my mind. “So many young girls and women have gone missing and many have been found dead.” She said she didn’t know where to look any more, because Esam spent most of her time at home. “I am confused. The fact that she never made it to school is stressful and shocking.” Babalwa said her daughter was not the kind of child who didn’t want to go to school. “Please help me find my daughter.”
