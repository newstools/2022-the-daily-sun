THE ANC councillor and member of the municipal public accounts committee at the Moses Kotane Local Municipality, who was arrested for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl, appeared before the Mogwase Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 11 January. The case was postponed for further consultation as the accused has a new lawyer. He will appear in court again on the 7 February. The 56-year-old man was arrested in June last year and was granted bail of R1 000. Bojanala regional conference preparatory committee co-ordinator Tshiamo Tsotetsi said the ANC refused to associate itself with leaders who didn’t have discipline. Tsotetsi said they were there to stand with the victim. “The ANC is in deep shame because a leader who was supposed to be leading by example is found among abusers. “The ANC will never support leaders who become perpetrators while they should be the ones protecting the society,” said Tsotetsi.
