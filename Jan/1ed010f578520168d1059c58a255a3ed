STARTING with academic work as early as possible has paid off for Velabahleke High School pupils. The school in Umlazi, south of Durban, usually starts school as early as December to give pupils time to complete the whole syllabus and enough time for revision. The top five pupils thanked teachers for their dedication. Sbusisiwe Sosibo (17) got distinctions in Zulu, English, mathematics, physical sciences, life sciences, economics, geography and life orientation. She said she would not have done it without the support of her family and teachers. “Our teachers started to prepare us in December 2020 after we were done with our grade 11 exams. We had extra classes every day. We had no holidays. I am happy it has paid off,” she said. Sbusisiwe got a bursary to study actuarial science at Stellenbosch University. Nhlanhla Gabayi (18), who did nine subjects, got eight distinctions in Zulu, mathematics, economics, physical sciences, accounting, central computer application, life science and life orientation. “I am over the moon and I am grateful for the teachers we have. They pushed us to be the best version of ourselves,” said Nhlanhla. He’s applied to study medicine at University of Cape Town. Ndumiso Zondi (18), Thobeka Mzimela (17) and Mthokozisi Ndwandwe (17) all got seven distinctions. Ndumiso, who’s applied to study computer science at University of Cape Town, said competing with himself helped him set a standard and achieve it. Thobeka said hard work and teamwork contributed to her achievement. “We even had classes during the weekend. I am happy to see such results.” Mthokozisi, who’s applied to study mechatronics at University of Cape Town, said: “Starting early to prepare paid off. The support we got from our teachers encouraged us to focus more on our studies.”
