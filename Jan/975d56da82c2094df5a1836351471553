MARK Siziba (35) makes beautiful artwork and displays it along the Mabopane Highway in Tshwane. Mark from Soshanguve told Daily Sun he has realised his childhood dream. “Actually, my art becomes my closest friends,” he said. His motto is: wake up and see the road in front of you. “The most important aspect is to respect your client more than yourself and listen what they want,” said the father of five. “I was not raised by my father and mother but by my grandparents.” He said life was so difficult that he became a man while he was still a child. “Being an artist means I am doing what is from my heart. I create something unique with paintings and I can create somethings that looks alive. “This gives me joy and I’m proud to make people happy.” Mark said his family is supportive of his artwork as it puts food on the table. “People don’t believe I am the one who creates these artpieces. They think I’m selling it for someone else. I also teach young people as I believe in empowering the community,” he said. “I want to see more people survive through their skills.” Mark does fine art, art figures, abstract art and creates nature, river, water and mountain scenes. “I can draw and paint anything around me,” he said. Mark also does signwriting, school logos and cartoon strips. His wife Pretty (27) said: “My husband loves his work and is always hustling to provide for us. “I always help him do his paintings.” She said rain is their biggest challenge as it stops the work.
