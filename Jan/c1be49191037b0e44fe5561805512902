SAFA and Bafana Bafana coach, Hugo Broos, are tirelessly working around the clock to secure two friendlies in March, preferably against top European nations who qualified for the 2022 Fifa World Cup finals in Qatar. During March, the first Fifa break of 2022, 10 African countries and some in Europe, will be contesting for the World Cup play-off spots, a tournament that starts in November. There are many European nations who are looking to play friendly games against African nations to prepare for the World Cup, which makes it easy for Safa. Safa president Danny Jordaan is in Cameroon where some football leaders from around the world are attending the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals, set to end on 6 February. Bafana will not be able to play against nations from South America as the World Cup qualifiers in the Conmebol (South American) region resume this month and will also be played in March. Bafana could play Ivory Coast, who like Bafana, failed to progress to the World Cup play-offs and are available for friendly matches. Bafana lost to Ghana in the last and crucial match of the 2022 World Cup qualifier in November under controversial circumstances. That’s why Bafana will not play a competitive match until September. Bafana captain Ronwen Williams said Broos mentioned last time that “he’s going try all means possible in every Fifa calendar date to get friendlies”. “The coach is still fairly new. He doesn’t know all the players yet. He said he still has to watch a lot of games and obviously the guys who are playing overseas,” said Williams. Meanwhile, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) has confirmed the 2023 Afcon preliminary round draw will be conducted tomorrow in Douala, Cameroon. Bafana, because of their high ranking in Africa, will go straight into the group stage.
