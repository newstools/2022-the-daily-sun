TRAGEDY struck a family when a 10-year-old girl drowned at Strand Beach in Cape Town on Saturday, 1 January. National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Gordon’s Bay station commander Alan Meiklejohn said they were called to the scene by law enforcement officers. “On arrival at the scene, a sea rescue craft searched in the direction of sea currents. “A resident of a block of flats opposite Strand Beach then reported seeing the girl in the water a distance away from where she had originally been swimming,” he said. Meiklejohn said the NSRI crew spotted the girl’s body in the water and took her out to the shore. “She was recovered onto the sea rescue craft and brought to paramedics on the shore where sadly she was declared dead,” he said. NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon said another man, believed to be in his 50s, also died in Sea Point after experiencing difficulties in the water.
