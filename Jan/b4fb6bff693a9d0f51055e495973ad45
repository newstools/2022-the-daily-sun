PRISONERS at the Phalaborwa Police Station holding cells had a great time on New Year’s Eve. This comes after a night shift cop allegedly supplied them with booze and dagga. But the good times stopped rolling when the inmates got drunk and allegedly assaulted each other. Some prisoners were also allegedly raped. Now the officer has found himself in hot water and was suspended on Friday, 7 January while an investigation takes place. Two suspects, aged 23 and 39, have been arrested and charged for rape and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. They appeared in the Phalaborwa Magistrates Court on Friday, 7 January and their cases were postponed to 18 January. Limpopo police spokesman, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, said they placed the involved cop on suspension to allow the investigation to take place. “Both liquor and dagga were allegedly being supplied to the inmates and we are still determining how much was sold. At this stage I can’t divulge if the cop was operating alone or if other colleagues were involved. A decisive decision is going to be taken against the suspended cop after the investigation,” said Mojapelo. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe assured the public that the police holding cells are managed in accordance with existing internal policies. “What happened at Phalaborwa Police Station is an isolated incident, which is being internally dealt with to ensure decisive and appropriate sanction is ultimately meted again the said cop,” she said. Witness Tiva, a spokesman for social development department, said a team of social workers will be sent to the police station to work with the police to ensure the victims receive counselling. “We also condemned what transpired and believe police investigations will shed more light on what transpired,” said Tiva.
