I guess this is every parent’s dream. As a family, we are very excited and trying to keep everything private. “My son-in-law is not a public figure, so we’re not going to disclose his identity. They’ve known each other for over three years and are happy,” she said. “Lobola negotiations and wedding arrangements haven’t started yet but plans are underway for both families to meet. Otherwise, we will keep everyone posted via social media platforms.” Rethabile rose to fame when she was featured on DJ Zinhle’s track Umlilo. She has since launched a solo career and has collaborated with artists such as Master KG and Lenzo.
