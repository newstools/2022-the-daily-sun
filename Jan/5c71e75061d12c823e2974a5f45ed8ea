TAKING a leak or urinating is a normal human activity. However, does this human excretion process take longer than it should for you? In other words, do you take longer than usual to pee? Healthline magazine explains that excessive urination or polyuria is when you urinate more than normal. Urine volume is considered excessive if it equals more than 2,5L per day. According to medical experts, excreting excessive volumes of urine can be normal, but some medical reasons warrant for concern. From bladder infection and diabetes to urinary inconsistency, taking longer to pee can have medical implications to it. The publication highlights that excessive urine volume often occurs due to lifestyle behaviours. This can include drinking large amounts of liquid, which is known as polydipsia and isn’t a serious health concern. Drinking alcohol and caffeine can also lead to polyuria, as well as certain medications such as diuretics. Both alcohol and caffeine are diuretics, together with some medications for high blood pressure and edema. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common causes of polyuria. In this condition, high amounts of glucose collect in your kidney tubules, causing your urine volume to increase. Treating excessive urine volume or polyuria is often guided by symptoms such as signal spinal cord disorders, diabetes, kidney infections or cancer. Treatment can help you quickly address the cause and maintain good health. Medical experts warn that if you think the increase is due to an increase in fluids or medication, you should monitor your urine volume for a couple of days. If it continues after this period of monitoring, talk to your doctor.
