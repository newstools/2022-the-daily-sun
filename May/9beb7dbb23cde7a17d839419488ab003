FORMER Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama has been arrested on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. He is expected to appear in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on Friday, 27 May. He was arrested together with former Transnet acting group CFO Garry Pita, ex-group treasurer Phetolo Ramosebudi, Regiments’ Eric Wood and Trillian Asset Management director Daniel Roy by the Hawks and National Prosecuting Authority’s Investigating Directorate (ID). The five men, who were arrested on Friday after handing themselves over at the Brackendowns Police Station, will join Gupta “fixer” Kuben Moodley in the dock. Moodley was arrested last September and is out on bail. He was captured at OR Tambo International Airport as he was about to catch a flight to Dubai. He was then arrested in connection with alleged money laundering of the proceeds from contracts improperly awarded by Transnet to Regiments and Trillian, as well as alleged theft of funds from the Transnet Second Defined Benefit Fund. ID spokesman Sindisiwe Seboka confirmed that Gama and his co-accused were arrested, and would be appearing in court.
