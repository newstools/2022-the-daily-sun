CONTRALESA general secretary Zolani Mkiva supports a referendum on the death penalty. Mkiva backed up the call made by organisation president Kgoshi Mathibela Mokoena while speaking at the recent celebration of Mokoena’s re-election. Held at the Mathibela Sports Ground in Oakley Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, the event was attended by amakhosi, businesspeople and local political leaders. Mkiva said Mokoena called for a referendum as people were getting away with murder. “We’re saying we need to test this because every day, we receive a volume of correspondence,” he said. “People are crying to us as Contralesa to say the president should intervene as our women and children are being butchered.” Spokesman for the presidency Tyrone Seale said the government was intensifying its fight against crime. “We welcome the seriousness and gravity of sentencing with which our courts approach violent crimes in particular,” he said.
