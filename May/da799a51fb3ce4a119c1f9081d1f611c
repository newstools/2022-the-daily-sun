THE investigations into the VBS scandal continues to rake in more and more suspects after six were nabbed by Hawks on Tuesday, 24 May. Five municipal workers will make their first appearance in the Orkney Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 25 May, where they will be facing charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. The sixth suspect in the case is said to be under police guard at a hospital where he was arrested. Hawks spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale said: “The six suspects aged between 37 and 45 were arrested simultaneously in Joburg, Vryburg, Orkney and Klerksdorp respectively on 24 May for alleged fraud, corruption and money laundering worth about R2,5 million.” Mogale said the probe emanated from the VBS investigation wherein investigators noticed suspicious transactions on the account of the Dr Kenneth Kaunda Municipality. She said further probing revealed that between 2017 and 2019, money was allegedly continuously deposited from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda Municipality accounts into the accounts of three municipal officials. According to the Hawks, one of the three officials who has since left the municipality would allegedly routinely make payments into the bank accounts of his wife and brother. He reportedly also routed more funds into an account belonging a woman in Joburg allegedly under the guise of a tender that was awarded. The woman would subsequently send the money back to him. The national head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya expressed his gratitude on a job well to both the investigation and prosecution in ensuring that these suspects are brought before court. “No efforts will be spared in ridding the country of corruption and related activities,” said Lebeya.
