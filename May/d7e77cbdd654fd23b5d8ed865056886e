BEING a doctor is every child’s dream. And this what Dr Nokukhanya Nyalunga dreamt of while growing up. The dentist from Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga is the owner of Smile Denti Care, which is situated at Maqhawe Square Shopping Complex. She said when she saw the centre, she envisioned putting primary healthcare professionals together under one roof where patients would get a higher level of healthcare services. She needed a nurse, optometrist and a dentist and fortunately, one of her friends decided to open a pharmacy. Today, the people of Siyabuswa and neighbouring areas access healthcare services at the centre. But not all is sorted out. “We are still looking for a social worker, dietician and psychologist, as well as an occupational therapist and audiologist and the list can go on,” said Nokukhanya. She said she also runs dental outreach programmes, where she often visit schools to educate pupils about oral health. A plan is in the pipeline to reach out to mostly lower income workers in the area to help with oral health services. . Almost 80% of the world population suffers from oral health problems, such as lost teeth, cavities, pain, sensitivity, bad breath but mainly bleeding gums or gum disease. Nokukhanya encouraged people to look after their teeth and health by making it possible to visit their centre every six months to have their mouths checked. She said people who fail to regularly wash their mouths would have problems with their teeth. She urged people not to eat more processed foods, because these caused cavities and gum diseases. The other cause of gum disease is remnants of food left in the mouth that are not removed by brushing teeth or using mouthwash.
