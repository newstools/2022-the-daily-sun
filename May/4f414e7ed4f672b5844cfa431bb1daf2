A TAXI boss and an alleged hitman who were charged with murder have been remanded in custody by the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrates Court on Monday, 23 May. Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Bonnie Nxumalo said it was alleged that on 16 February, firefighter Annah Mnguni (59) was at her workplace at the Tshwane Fire Department in Bronkhorstspruit when she was fatally shot by unknown gunmen. The incident prompted the investigation by the Pretoria based Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation. Nxumalo said on 20 May, the Hawks’ teams, Crime Against the State and Tactical Operational Management Section, as well as Head Office Crime Intelligence, arrested the accused at their places of residence in Krugersdorp and Soweto. “They were charged and appeared in court. The motive for the killing is under investigation,” said Nxumalo. The matter was remanded to 27 May for a formal bail application.
