ZAM’PHILO squatters have been blocking Baden Powell Road since Monday 16 May. They told Daily Sun they were unhappy that the City of Cape Town was not allowing them to extend their small shacks. They said the city had security guards who lived in the camp in Khayelitsha to monitor them. Resident Sizakhele Bekapi (60) said: “When we occupied this land during Covid-19, we didn’t have money to build proper shacks.” Ncedo Pehana (35) said the city was making their lives a living hell. “If officers just hear a hammer knocking some nails, they will demolish your shack.” Human settlements MMC Malusi Booi said the municipality was investigating the matter and residents with concerns should approach the authorities. “The city has the right to secure and protect its land from unlawful occupation, especially to prevent the extreme health and safety problems that result from unlawful occupation,” he said.
