EVERY night, she hears a sjambok hitting her bed but she can’t see who is holding it. After hitting the bed, the tokoloshe breathes into her face, forcing her to hide under her blankets. The woman from Kagiso, Mogale City, told Daily Sun the creature had been tormenting her for 10 years and she desperately needed help to get rid of it. “I’ve been to several izangoma, but no one seems to have the power to chase it away,” she said. The woman said the sjambok-wielding tokoloshe made it near impossible to sleep. “It whips the four corners of the bed and the walls of my bedroom,” she said. The woman told the SunTeam the tokoloshe was very jealous and didn’t want her to have a man in her life. “My relationships don’t last long as the tokoloshe makes sure no man gets into my bed,” she said. The woman said her problems started when she left her cheating husband, who died three years ago. “He told me as long as I was not with him, I would have no peace and he would make my life difficult. I desperately need help,” she said. The woman said she decided to leave after 12 years of marriage. “He was a habitual cheater and I would sometimes find him in our bed with other women. “One day, I decided to pack my things and leave. He was not happy about that,” she said. “I had enough and just wanted my peace. He told me he’d make sure my life was difficult and I believe this tokoloshe was his doing.” Sangoma Khethiwe Ndlovu said the husband must have sent a strong and stubborn tokoloshe called mpondolo to curse the woman, and she needed a strong sangoma to unlock it.
