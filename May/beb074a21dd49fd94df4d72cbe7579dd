FEMALE taxi operators from Ehlanzeni in Mpumalanga led a march against gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF) on the streets of Masoyi on Wednesday, 25 May. Stella Ntimbane, secretary of the White Hazy Taxi Association, told Daily Sun they decided to march in solidarity with the family of Bontle Mashiyane and the entire community. She said the association was saddened about what happened and will provide the necessary support to the family. “One of our own has been killed brutally. It saddened us as taxi operators to say a future commuter, who is the future of our industry, has been killed. We have just celebrated Mother’s Day and our partners are killing us and our children. What went wrong?” said Ntimbane She made call to the government to rename the street where Mashiyane was abducted to Bontle Mashiyane Street in order to keep her memory alive, as well as that of the two Qibi sisters who were killed in the same area three years ago. Six-year-old Bontle was reported missing on 30 April. Her mutilated body was found dumped not far from her home last Saturday. Five people between the ages of 25 and 64 were arrested and charged for the little girl’s murder. They appeared in the KaBokweni Magistrates Court on Monday and Tuesday. It’s alleged that they confessed that they killed Mashiyane to trade her body parts for muthi. Family spokesman Norman Mazibane said the family was devastated. “This incident happened when the mother was eight months pregnant. We had to concentrate on her health and deal with this issue. The mother is broken, but we are there for her as the family,” he said. He said that they are comforted by the fact that the suspects have been arrested.
