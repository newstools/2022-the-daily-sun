A 39-YEAR-OLD man who was wanted by the Nelspruit Hawks for alleged fraud and contravention of the Tax Administration Act handed himself over on Monday, 30 May. He was wanted for an investigation in relation to alleged fraud between 2018 and 2021. During that time, the businessman was the director of a company where he allegedly submitted fraudulent tax returns to the South African Revenue Services and prejudiced the receiver of revenue an amount of R28 million. The investigation team traced him and he promised to hand himself over, which he never did. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, the court then issued a warrant for his arrest and the team utilised several tactics to assist in securing his appearance in court including enlisting the assistance of the public. “During his appearance in court, the investigation and prosecution teams brought to the attention of the court that he has more than 10 properties in Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Durban and Limpopo registered under his name and all the addresses have to be verified before his attempt at a bail application,” she said. The matter was postponed to Friday, 3 June.
