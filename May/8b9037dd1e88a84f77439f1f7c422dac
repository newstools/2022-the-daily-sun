WHEN Hossen Lucky left his home country of Bangladesh for Mzansi, he hoped to become a wealthy businessman. But the opposite happened as the 30-year-old, who’s known as “My Friend” ekasi, lives in a borrowed shack in Tsebe section in Mabopane, north of Tshwane. He has no water or electricity, forcing him to cook outside on a fire. This is because he spends all his money on drugs and women. Hossen said he and some of his countrymen came to Mzansi in 2014 to start a chain of tuck shops. They had a tight business plan and he was placed in Mabopane for his business. “I got here and rented a place and all was going well until I started to have a lot of girlfriends, whom I gave money to. “I also made bad friends who introduced me to nyaope. After that, everything came crushing down on me,” he said. Hossen said his mastandi kicked him out as he could not pay rent anymore and he was forced to sleep at a local church. “The shop closed and I sold the remaining stock to feed my nyaope cravings. I tried to get in touch with the men I came with, but they all cut me off. We had a plan and I failed to fulfil it. We came here to better our lives and our families’ lives, instead I threw it away,” he said. Hossen said he was also kicked out of the church he lived in because of his drug habit and fortunately someone gave him a shack to live in temporarily. “I’m living a life I never imagined for myself. I live on hand-outs.” Hossen said he wanted to fix his life and start another business. Hossen’s neighbour, Margaret Letsoalo (54), said he is a good man who made bad decisions. She said he needs to go to rehab so he can fix his life.
