UDULA Operation leader Nhlanhla 'Lux' Mohlauli appeared
again at the Meadowlands Magistrate Court in Soweto. Nhlanhla appeared in court for an assault charge. He is
accused of having assaulted his mum's tenant back in 2019. He was arrested after a warrant of arrest was issued against
him for allegedly failing to come to court. The matter was postponed to 17 June 2022. On the next court date, the complainant is expected to be
present in the court. Meanwhile, Nhlanhla told Jozi FM  that he believes the case is politically
motivated because he says he doesn't know what wrong he has done. Nhlanhla is also due back in the Roodepoort Magistrates
Court soon for another assault. He allegedly assaulted an EFF member, whose incident
prompted the Red Berets to accompany their member to open a case against
Nhlanhla. He is out on bail and has been instructed by the court, as
part of his conditions, not to interact with the complainant in any way.
