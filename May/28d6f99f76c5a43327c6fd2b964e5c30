GOGO Beauty Sikeyi (64) from Tafelsig in Mitchells Plain used to lock up her two grandchildren to save them the pain of seeing other kids wearing school uniforms. This is after she applied for the kids to go to school. The gogo’s granddaughter, aged 17 and 14 , had been staying at home for the past two years, and the other one could not get a place this year. But after Daily Sun told of the gogo’s pain, both kids secured places to learn. The SunTeam spoke to the department and they assisted the two girls. ALSO READ | ZIYAKHALA!
