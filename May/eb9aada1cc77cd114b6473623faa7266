IT does not come as obvious as this – Mamelodi Sundowns stars, Peter Shalulile and Andile Jali, were the big winners at the PSL Awards on Sunday night. Shalulile has been a marvel to watch throughout the season where he has been banging goals more than anyone, close to breaking Collins Mbesuma’s long-standing record of 25 goals. He ran two goals shy of reaching the record.For the second year running, deservedly so, Shalulile won both the 2021-22 PSL Footballer of the Season and DStv Premiership Player’s Player of the Season awards. And Jali has also the darling of South African fans with his neat passing that ensured Sundowns’ consistency this season, and his control of the game came on to the spotlight. Jali scooped the MTN8 Last Man Standing, Nedbank Cup Player of the Tournament, and DStv Premiership Midfielder of the Season categories. The Premiership Coach of the Season award went to Sundowns’ co-coaches – Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena. #DStvPrem Coach of the Season :#PSLAwards2022 pic.twitter.com/z5z8nM75P4  Congratulations @Masandawana @Lylo7 for Defender of the season. Ma sé kind! Dzeyi waar’s my tee?   This will make Mngqithi feel better after he moaned last year when he felt was snubbed of the big gong despite having led the Brazilians to a super win. SuperSport United’s Luke Fleurs walked away with the Young Player of the Season award while Lyle Lakay (Mamelodi Sundowns) and Hugo Marques (Cape Town City) won Defender and Goalkeeper of the Season awards respectively.
