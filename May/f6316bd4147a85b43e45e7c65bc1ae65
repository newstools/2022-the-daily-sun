A MAN who was admitted to Shongwe Hospital in Mpumalanga committed suicide by hanging himself in the hospital’s toilets on Wednesday morning, 25 May. Mpumalanga health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said the man, who was in his late 30s, was admitted on Tuesday, 24 May. He said he was brought to casualty by cops after they found him around the Matsamo Border Post to Eswatini, where he was picking up stones. “The patient is also alleged to have attempted to grab a gun from one of the police officers. Malamule said he was untidy, confused and was admitted as an unknown patient. He said there was no history of violence or aggression that was reported in the ward. The patient was to be admitted for 72 hours for observation, with a diagnosis of acute psychosis. “This morning he was given clean clothes and everything seemed normal. At about 9am when a staff member was giving breakfast to patients, one patient called her to come and see what was happening in the toilets,” he said. He said when the staff member went to investigate, they discovered that the patient had hanged himself against the toilet window burglar proofing, using a stockinette bandage. “Doctors were called and unfortunately the patient was declared dead on the scene. The family of the patient has been traced and informed about the incident,” he said. Health MEC Sasekani Manzini has expressed shock about the incident.
