ANGRY residents threatened to take the law into their own hands if ANC councillor Sephiri Liphoko is released from police custody. The Virginia Magistrates Court in the Free State has postponed Liphoko’s bail application for the second time. Liphoko was arrested on 2 May for allegedly masterminding the brutal murder of councillor candidate Piet Moletsane on 23 September last year. Liphoko made his first appearance in court on 4 May and the case was postponed to 13 May for bail application. The state has argued that the accused is a dangerous person and should be in police custody until his trial. During the court appearance on Friday, 27 May, it was revealed that Liphoko had a murder case outstanding from 2003. The court also found him guilty of unlawfully occupying a farm outside Virginia and he was arrested for stabbing his wife last year. Thereafter he attempted to commit suicide. The suspect will remain in custody until 6 June as it will be a continuation of the bail application. Security was beefed up as residents from Meloding were picketing and waving placards outside court. A few weeks after Moletsane’s murder, angry residents vandalised the suspect’s house. A family member told Daily Sun they have been threatened since Liphoko was arrested. “We call for police visibility,” said the relative. Community leader Thapelo Mohapi said the accused would not be welcomed should he get bail. Moletsane ‘s father called for a harsher sentence for Liphoko and his co-accused.
