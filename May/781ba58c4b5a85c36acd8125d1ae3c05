News hitting SunSport desk is that Pretoria Callies has officially been sold to Maritzburg businessman, Lebo Mokoena. It's understood the deal was sealed on Thursday night, when both parties agreed to terms. According to information reaching SunSport, Mokoena apparently plans on taking the GladAfrica Championship club to the Free State. "It's unclear if he bought the entire club or just the NFD status," said our informant. Mokoena has had ambitions on buying Bloemfontein Celtic when it was still under Max Tshabalala. But his pursuit to purchase the club apparently hit a snag as Tshabalala demanded a lot of money from him. When contacted for comment on Friday, Mokoena said he was in a meeting and promised to give comment later, but unfortunately he's phone was off at the time he promised to comment. Callies survived Championship relegation by the skin of their teeth. The club has been on sale midway through to the 2021-22 Championship season when owner struggled financially. Players went on months with being paid, SunSport was told at the time. However, potential buyers, including a Mpumalanga business consortium, said they can only agree to terms if the team avoided relegation, as they didn't want to risk buying an ABC Motsepe League club.
