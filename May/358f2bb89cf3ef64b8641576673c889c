LOCAL petrol prices were expected to hit record highs at midnight when new prices take effect. The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) would have already announced the official petrol price for June, but this time around, it’s all different. The department announced the official price that was supposed to take effect. But in a twist, it announced that the levy would be extended for another two months. According to the Department of Mineral Resources and
Energy, the price of 95 unleaded petrol will rise by R2.33 per litre on
Wednesday, while 93 petrol will rise by R2.43 per litre. Diesel prices will increase by R1.07, while
illuminating paraffin will cost R1.56 more per litre. In late March, the government reduced the levy by R1,50 for April and May, which brought temporary relief to consumers. According to the Automobile Association (AA), based on mid-month unaudited data from the Central Energy Fund, petrol was expected to increase by between R1,93/L and R1,97/L, diesel by between R1,60/L and R1,62/L, and illuminating paraffin by a whopping R2,14/L. Had government reinstated the levy and saw citizens paying over R25 per litre, this would have not only affected motorists but also those who used taxis as the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) had hinted at possible fare increases. Speaking to EWN, Santaco’s Bafana Magagula said: “Maybe the only difference is that due to the petrol hike, increases may be a bit sharper; higher than expected. However, we still consider our commuters coming from disadvantaged areas.”
