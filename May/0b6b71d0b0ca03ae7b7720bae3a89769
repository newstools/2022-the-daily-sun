IF “traffic officers” stop you in unmarked cars with blue lights, just sped off! They might be hijackers out to get your car. This is a warning from cops. Police in the West Rand District say they’ve noted with concern an increasing number of truck and car hijackings reported lately. They said perpetrators of this crime operate in a group of two, three, or even four or five. Captain Solomon Sibiya said they use a white Toyota Hilux double cab and/or a white VW Polo with a blue light and are dressed in traffic officers’ uniform. “As police we urge motorists and truck drivers to be more cautious and not be fooled by people dressed in police or traffic uniform.” Police have identified areas and spots where hijackings by people impersonating officers take place: 1. Carletonville - Blybank Road and Randfontein Road 2. Fochville - Corner N12 and R500. 3. Randfontein – R559, R28 and N14 To minimise hijackings, police urge people to not do the following: ¦ Do not stop for hitchhikers, even if it’s a female hiker with a crying baby showing desperation or vulnerability. ¦ Do not stop for anyone if you suspect that the person might be a bogus officer. Drive to the nearest police station, shopping complex or any other busy area. Do not try to drive to your residential area. ¦ Do not stop at a deserted spot or area to talk on your phone or even relieve yourself. ¦ Always keep your windows closed. ¦ If someone tries to force you off the road, don’t panic. Just hoot constantly to draw attention.
