RESIDENTS of Tweefontein, Mpumalanga, asked the municipality to fix their pothole-riddled street, but nothing happened. So they lost their patience and recently decided to close the potholes themselves. Andrew Ndlovu (40) said they asked for donations from motorists. He said the money was not for their own benefit but to buy concrete, sand and cement to close the giant potholes. He told Daily Sun if they didn’t take action, they would end up with no street. He said the street was used by buses and taxis. “We have waited too long for the municipality to close the potholes. “Nothing happened so we felt that if they can’t do it, then we can do it ourselves. “Water flowing down the street is the main reason there are potholes. “We asked for donations from all motorists who pass here. We used the money to buy cement and sand. We also bought lunch,” he said. Sipho Mahlangu (35) said even officials drove municipal vehicles on the rotten street. “Nobody cares about the street and it gets damaged daily. Since we are not busy, we have decided to do it ourselves. The street belongs to all of us. We don’t get paid but motorists make donations,” he said. Kosabo Mbonani (43) said this was not the only street they had fixed. “We have fixed many streets and unblocked storm water drainages. Water is not flowing freely and it comes on the street. Storm water drainages wer full of sand and rubbish. We had to clean them to allow water to move freely,” he said. Thembisile Hani Municipality spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane Mokako said their pothole patcher machine had arrived. She said all roads with potholes would be fixed soon and people just needed to be patient.
