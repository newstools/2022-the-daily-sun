AS part of Africa Day commemorations on Wednesday, 25 May, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) marched to the French Embassy in Tshwane. The marchers, led by party leader Julius Malema, were demanding the withdrawal of France from the African continent. Before Malema could read the memorandum, he went into the embassy to demand that someone comes out to receive the memorandum. He said Africans must not allow colonalism to divide them. “We must fight colonialism as we build our own continent. “We must make sure that resources of our land are retained in Africa and we can only do so when we are united as Africans,” he said. Malema said Africans do not need the French and American currency. He also said anyone who preached xenophobia was a spy for the French. “Fighters, when you see other Africans you must see yourselves. We must fight capitalism and treat each other as Africans,” he said. Malema further took a swipe at President Cyril Ramaphosa for not attending to the mineworkers who have been camping at the Union Buildings since last week. He said if Ramaphosa was a leader, he would have gone out to receive the workers’ memorandum. The party gave the embassy 14 days to respond. The Ambassador for France in SA, Aurelien Lechevallier, received the memorandum from the EFF protesters.
