VILLAGERS from Moshawane Village in North West hope the municipality strengthens efforts to develop their rural area. The residents told Daily Sun they don’t feel like they live in a democratic country as it has not benefitted them. Most people live in mud houses and they complained about a lack of housing, road infrastructure, water and electricity. Community leader Goodwin Maphutshi accused municipal officials of only speaking to them when they want votes. “There is absolutely nothing in our village. We use donkeys as our mode of transport. We struggle to get anywhere on rainy days due to a lack of roads. There’s not even a single RDP house that has been provided. We need toilets, water and electricity. The empty promises are tiring. We’re now hopeless,” said Maphutshi. He called for government’s urgent intervention. Resident Ernest Molefe (30) said he had been living in a mud house with his parents and siblings for 10 years. “We have applied for an RDP house several times without any luck. The mud house is as good as living outside. It gets worse on rainy days,” he said. Ratlou Municipality spokesman Lesego Metsi said: “As a small grant dependent municipality, we acknowledge that not enough is being done to address the challenges of service delivery in our villages. “In Moshawane, specifically, we’re responsible for internal roads and so far we have improved Moshawane link road from gravel to surface level,” he said. Metsi said it may not be enough as the road was supposed to pass through the entire village but they couldn’t finish the project due to financial constraints.
