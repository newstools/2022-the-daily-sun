THE Bloemfontein High Court has imposed a harsh sentence on Katleho Moeketsi (24) for the murder of gogo Louisa Potgieter. Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said on 25 August 2021, cops were alerted to a body found in an open veld near Morojaneng township in Free State. He said cops found the body of the 64-year-old gogo covered in blood. “The Emergency Medical Services and Police Forensic Analysts were also summoned to the scene and the victim was declared dead. The suspect was arrested following a tip-off by a vigilant resident of Dewetsdorp who spotted the stolen Volkswagen Golf in Mangaung and immediately alerted the police,” Covane said. He said the suspect was arrested with the victim’s white VW Golf. Covane said investigations into the matter led to Moeketsi standing trial and getting convicted following numerous court appearances. On Friday, 13 May, he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on the count of robbery with aggravated circumstances and 25 years imprisonment on the count of murder.
