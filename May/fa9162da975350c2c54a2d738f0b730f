MEDIA personality Minnie Dlamini has penned a heartfelt message to Lungile Radu. In the letter, she thanks and appreciates Lungile for teaching her the ropes in the film industry. Her message reads: “I’ve been working with this multitalented powerhouse for about four years. I always joke and say he’s my TV husband but in all honesty he’s my big brother who has taught me so much about this business, and has no issue to let me shine. The moment I told him I’m producing my first film he told me immediately he’s in, no questions asked (No Love Lost on @showmaxonline, shameless plug I know). “Working with you is such fun, it doesn’t feel like work. It’s not your birthday or any special day, I just wanted to show my love and appreciation for my bro @lungileradu The presenting duo that produces TV & film,” she said. Their supporters couldn’t agree more as they took turns in celebrating them. Lele Bodibe said: “One of the most disciplined guy I know. Thank you Minnie for showing that we need to appreciate people we love while they are still alive. I love that you choose positivity in this negative world.” Thandeka Khumalo commented: “Lungile is just amazing I’ve loved this man for years.” Jeffrey Dilebo wrote: “Best wishes. You are both doing a great job on the TV screen. You are honestly blessed. Indeed he’s a great guy, he seems polite and humble.” A post shared by Minnie (@minniedlamini)
