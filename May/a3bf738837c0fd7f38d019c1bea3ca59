THREE people died and seven were injured following a collision between a Fortuner and a bakkie on the N1, north of Polokwane, on Saturday morning, 21 May. ER24 spokesman Ross Campbell said paramedics arrived on the scene at 5.25am to find that five patients from the bakkie had already been transported to hospital with minor injuries by another Emergency Medical Service. He said the driver from the bakkie was still on-scene, but declined transportation. “Six patients from the Fortuner, which was found off the side of the road, were still on-scene. “One female and one male, both believed to be between the ages of 40 and 50, were found on the ground behind the vehicle. They showed no signs of life and were declared dead on arrival by ER24,” Campbell said in a statement. He said a second woman of about the same age was found entrapped in the Fortuner in a critical condition. “Provincial Rescue were busy with her extraction when she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries,” Campbell added. He said a 29-year-old man and a three-year-old toddler were transported to Polokwane Provincial Hospital after sustaining serious injuries. Campbell added that circumstances surrounding the incident were not known, but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
