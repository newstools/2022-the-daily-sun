ST PETER’S African Church in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, held a centenary celebration for gogo Letty Buthelezi-Menyuku on Sunday, 29 May. Gogo Letty is still healthy and strong, and can do a lot of things independently. During the celebration, she told Daily Sun that mabele pap, masonja (mopani worms) and morogo (spinach) were keeping her healthy. She advised young people to avoid alcohol and smoking. Gogo said being respectful was the other reason she managed to reached 100 years. “Well, it’s not a secret that if you live by the Bible verse of honouring your mother and father, you will live long. I am proof of that.” She said after waking every morning, she does little stretches and exercises so that her body doesn’t get stiff. “I am able to take a bath by myself. I can still cook and wash the dishes. I don’t need a walking stick. I am grateful that God has kept me this far and I look forward to spending more years on earth,” she said. One of gogo Letty’s grandchildren, Windsor (54), said they were happy gogo is still alive even though all seven of her children died. “We’re privileged to have her in our lives She can still do a lot of things by herself, but we do have a helper that assists,” he said. Representing the church, Lucky Pitswane, said it was a blessing to have gogo Letty in the church. He said they have the responsibility of ensuring gogo goes to church as she is still able to walk. He said they saw it fit to host a celebration for her and give thanks to God for keeping her all these years. Gauteng Social Development MEC Morakane Mosupye said the department was responsible for taking care of the vulnerable in society and that theelderly and that’s why they came to celebrate with gogo and hand out the goodies. Gogo has 60 grandchildren, 11 great- grandchildren and seven great-great grandchildren.
