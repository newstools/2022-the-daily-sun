THE words from grandfather Sehoko Khoabane are encouraging: “Neo can move his hands although he is struggling to speak.” He is talking about the 11-year-old boy who, along with his three siblings, was allegedly given poison in an energy drink by their father. The boy’s three siblings have died. Their father, who attempted suicide, is in hospital. The grandfather said the dad asked for forgiveness. “He said he doesn’t know what got into him. We forgive him but the matter is in the hands of the police now,” he said. The incident on Thursday left residents of Ratanda in Heidelberg and the Gauteng education department shocked. The father (40) allegedly gave his kids the drink after their mum left for work but the fifth sibling refused to drink it. Katleho Khoabane (13), Lehlohonolo Khoabane (16) and Tebogo Ngcongwane (6) died. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said the suspect is in hospital under police guard and he’s charged with murder and attempted murder.
