FORMER president Jacob Zuma visited Zulu king Misuzulu kaZwelithini at the weekend. King Misuzulu spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu told Daily Sun that it was a courtesy visit from Zuma to show his support to his king. “Former president Jacob Zuma is a Zulu person and he falls under the Zulu king Misuzulu. He has a right to come and see his king anytime he wants. “His visit was not a big one, because he can visit his king anytime when he wants and I don’t want people to complicate it” he said. Prince Thulani refused to disclose the date and the place where Zuma and king Misuzulu met, but he said their meeting is not newsworthy. Zuma was close to the late king Zwelithini and he used to attend many Zulu royal house events and wear his traditional attire during the events. ??????

Last year many people were surprised when Zulu Amabutho late commanding general Mgilija Nhleko was fired after he led Amabutho to support Jacob Zuma before he was arrested after he refusing to appear before the State Capture commission. After many of Amabutho in Zulu attire went to Nkandla to support Zuma, Zulu royal house released a statement saying they were not authorised and later their leader Mgilija was fired when he defended himself saying they supported Zuma because he’s an Amabutho member. It seems like water under the bridge for Zuma and he’s showing her loyalty to his king, just like he did to king Zwelithini.
