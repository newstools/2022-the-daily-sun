MEMBERS of the LGBTQI+ community are living in fear. The community in the Vaal, south of Joburg, has been left traumatised by the brutal murder of one of their own. Ntokozo Motloung’s decomposing body was found in the bushes outside Tshepong on Saturday 21 May, a week after she was last seen by her family. Sidwell Lengatsa, a representative of the LGBTQI+ community, told Daily Sun: “This thing is becoming a pandemic. “We are living in fear. This is not only affecting the family, we are all affected. “Emfuleni is slowly becoming the home of hate crime. We were horrified when we heard about the brutal way in which Ntokozo was killed.” According to mourners who visited the family, the suspect was a man originally from Lesotho, aged between 45 and 50. Ntokozo’s mum, Josephine, said not enough was being done to arrest him. “I was with the suspect at De Deur Police Station but they failed to arrest him. He disappeared right in front of them,” she said. Josephine said the suspect, who was the last person to be seen with her daughter at a party, told her he was only interested in finding out whether Ntokozo was a man or a woman. Major-General Zodwa Molefe said: “Her throat was cut, her hands were broken and rats had already eaten some of her body parts. Police are still searching for the suspect.” A memorial service will be held outside Ntokozo’s home on Thursday 26 May at 2pm.
