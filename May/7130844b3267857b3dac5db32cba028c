NOT all offenders return to society to continue a life of crime – and parolee Mpho Ramapela (42) is living proof of that. After serving seven years in prison for fraud, Mpho started a soup kitchen through her NGO Dithou Bashabi Rams Care Group in August 2021. At the time Mpho from Ramongoana Village in Makgodu outside Polokwane realised there were many poor people and child-headed families who ran the risk of getting involved in crime. Every Wednesday, hundreds of villagers flock to her place to get a hot cooked meal. “I was taught to love and care while in jail. Rehabilitation has played a big role in my life. I went through different programmes and my family supported me while in the correctional centre,” she said. Mpho said she could feed villagers every day if she got donations. Gogo Mapula Marokane (68) said she was happy that Mpho turned her life around. David Lebea (30) said they always look forward to Wednesdays. Polokwane Correctional Services communications manager Sachiel Nemafhohoni congratulated Mpho for her actions.
