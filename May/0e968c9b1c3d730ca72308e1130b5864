GOGO Rose Makena said her late brother Sam Baloyi’s daughter will have bad luck as she has angered the dead. The 75-year-old from Khutsong in Mamelodi East, Tshwane told Daily Sun Annika Chitamba took her father’s Nissan bakkie two weeks after he was buried on 19 March. Rose said after the burial, Annika took the bakkie to her place without telling the family. “Why did she take the car before the cleansing ceremony? She has angered the ancestors and is inviting bad luck. “We even involved the police to resolve the matter but she won’t listen to anyone, even though a case was opened.” Rose wants Annika and her sister to share their dad’s property with the blessing of the family. Annika said: “Is Sam not my father? So it’s my father’s car and now it’s mine.” Asked if she’d return the bakkie, she said Rose must call her. She then hung up.
