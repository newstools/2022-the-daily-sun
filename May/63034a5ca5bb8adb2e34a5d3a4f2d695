THE Senzo Meyiwa murder trial had a half-day delay on Monday, 30 May. Advocate Malesela Teffo, representing accused number one, objected to Netflix filming court proceedings. Netflix, which has released a five-part documentary on the murder, started filming in April. Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela said there had been complaints that when counsel spoke to their clients, they were followed by cameras and this could not be allowed. Representing Ten10 Films, the company producing content for Netflix, Advocate Ben Winks said: “We don’t know what we’ve been accused of and my client has not done anything illegal. If the client has breached any guidelines, we’ll hear that.” Teffo accused Winks of misleading the court as his clients were not present for the public good but to profit. He said witnesses complained they were exposed to harassment. Delivering his judgement, Maumela said: “I cannot order the people representing Netflix to vacate the court room. I cannot order Ten10 films to vacate. Whoever has an issue with that will take it up through the proper legal channels.” Teffo said he accepted the ruling but would take the matter further. After the adjournment, the court resumed the cross examination of Sergeant Thabo Mosia. The case of the accused, Muzikawukhulelwa Sibiya (34), Bongani Ntanzi (30), Mthobisi Mncube (36), Mthokoziseni Maphisa (35) and Sifisokuhle Ntuli (34), continues on Tuesday, 31 May.
