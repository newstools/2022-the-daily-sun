 PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has received representations from Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, on why she should not be suspended. Ramaphosa had written to Mkhwebane in March, asking her to provide him with reasons why he should not suspend her in terms of Section 194(3)(a) of the Constitution. The request was following confirmation from the Speaker of the National Assembly that the Section 194 Committee had resolved to continue with its consideration of the motion for the removal of the public protector. “The public protector has complied with the agreed deadline of 26 May, and the president will now give due consideration to the submission,” said Ramaphosa’s spokesman Tyrone Seale in a statement. Mkhwebane brought an interdict application to the Western Cape High Court to halt the impeachment process in parliament and prevent her possible suspension. The Constitutional Court effectively gave parliament the go ahead with the impeachment process. This after Mkhwebane failed in her bid to have apex court rescind its decision. This application was eventually dismissed on 6 May. Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula wrote to Ramaphosa informing him, and asking Mkhwebane for reasons why she should not be suspended.
