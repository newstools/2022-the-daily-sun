THE Mabitsela family from Kroonstad in the Free State wants justice after two of their loved ones shot, killed and set alight on 11 February last year. Thato Mabitsela (35) and Lebohang Mabitsela (27) died during a farm attack on Magdala farm in Kroonstad. Thato was shot with 11 bullets while his brother Lebohang was shot nine times. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Free State allegedly declined to prosecute the accused, a farmer, on the basis that it was self-defence. According to family spokesman Sonny Letswaka, they were not pleased with the outcome and the court proceedings. “We were never invited to court until the case was closed. Our sons were killed like dogs, but we only heard after a year that the matter had been closed and the court decline to prosecute. We need a fair trial for our children,” said Letswaka. “We will be happy if we can get a lawyer to help us on a pro bono basis.” Police evidence revealed that investigators found nine cartridges of ammunition, three rifle rounds of ammunition, two projectiles and two knifes. The suspect was stabbed with the knife in the neck and was taken to hospital by ambulance. NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said the prosecutor who was allocated the docket declined to prosecute because according to the evidence, the farmer acted in self-defence when he shot the brothers. “The allegations are that four men tried to attack farmer Pieter Swartz when he came out of his house. “He managed to get to his firearm and three men were shot in the process. “The fourth one ran away, but was arrested later,” said Shuping. “My advice is that the family of the deceased can submit representation to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the province, Advocate Navilla Somaru, if they are not happy with the decision.”
