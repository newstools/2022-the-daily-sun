Namibian, Peter Shalulile, missed Collins Mbesuma’s long-standing Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot record by a whisker, just three goals short of rewriting the record that was set by the Zambian 17-years back in the 2004-05 season. ?????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????????????? ??????#DStvPrem pic.twitter.com/juBMr8QfFg  The Mamelodi Sundowns striker scored his last DStv Premiership goal for the 2021-22 season on Monday when he helped the Brazilians to a 3-2 win against Royal AM at Chatsworth Stadium – his 23rd of the term, which rolled down the curtain on their season. ???????? ?????????????????????? ??????????????????! ??Our 1??2??th PSL title, our 5th in a row, for you Masandawana! ??#Sundowns #DStvPrem #Champ12ons pic.twitter.com/MBbBRt2AKn  He has scored eight more than AM’s Victor Letsoalo who is standing on 15, while Bienvenu Eva Nga of Chippa United is standing third with 10. There were hurrahs and drum beats at Chatsworth were the order of the day as Sundowns were officially crowned champions with firecrackers lit, their sixth in a row, 12th overall, and awarded the trophy, which they so deserved having completed the season with 65 points. This was the proud moment for Sundowns as they too walked away with a lucrative R15 million winners’ prize money, which will be shared their players and staff, as the club claims no cent from it. Their only downfall this season was not reaching the Caf Champions League final, which they so wanted to grasp from the hands of their former coach, Pitso Mosimane, who is now with Egyptian giants, Al Ahly. But they can console themselves that they have won the MTN8 last year, and are on course for a treble when they compete in the Nedbank Cup final against Marumo Gallants at Rustenburg’s Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday at 6pm. And the Brazilians’ medicals had to deal with a bout of influenza that hit the camp following the weekend’s downpour, but they still managed to assemble a competitive side. More pleasing for Sundowns is that most of their players are nominated for top PSL Awards – Shalulile, Andile Jali, Themba Zwane and co-coaches Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena. Monday's replayed match after it was washed out Saturday and abandoned in the 26th minutes, leaves AM still with a slim hope of finishing the season position two, should they win their league against Orlando Pirates on Friday at the same venue – and hope Bucs lose to Maritzburg United today, and Cape Town City on Monday. ??
