THE father of the gunman who massacred 19 children and two teachers during the week at a school in Texas, USA, has spoken out. He apologised for his 18-year-old son, saying the teen should have killed him instead. Salvador Ramos (42) said: “I’m sorry for what my son did.” Ramos said he never expected his son to do something like that. “He should have just killed me, you know, instead of doing something like that to someone,” added Ramos. According to the New York Post, the younger Ramos shot his 66-year-old grandmother in the face before storming into the Uvalde school “unhindered” and shooting dead 21 people inside a fourth grade classroom in what was one of the deadliest mass shootings in Texas history. The gunman was killed at the scene by responding law enforcement officers. The father told the The Daily Beast he had not been in his son’s life much as of late due to his job away from Uvalde.
