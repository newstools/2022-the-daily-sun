THEIR sister died 11 years ago and they visit her grave every now and then. But the Mokoena family was shocked to find someone else’s tombstone on their loved one’s grave in December. The person’s surname is also Mokoena. Dorah (46) from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, said they were sure that the grave belonged to her sister as she was buried near their mum. She said they couldn’t phahla at their sister’s grave because of the tombstone and also stopped visiting their mum’s grave as they feared their sister would feel neglected. She said they called the tombstone company, but the owner told them they didn’t have the other family’s contact details. The owner of Lebo B&B Tombstones, who refused to give her surname, asked the family to give them more time. “I told the family we need to investigate this thoroughly. They should be patient as we’re trying to fix the problem,” said Lebo.
