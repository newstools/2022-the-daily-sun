SENIOR government employee Neil Naidoo, who is at the centre of an alleged R3,5 million police bribe, has appeared in court. Naidoo, a director in the Department of Community Safety and Liaison, is accused of attempting to bribe investigating officials to stop investigations into a multimillion-rand national police tender. He and his two co-accused businessmen, Kenny Govender and Matthew Pillay, appeared in the East London Magistrates Court on Monday, 23 May, facing charges of corruption, theft and defeating the ends of justice. The investigation relates to a R36 million contract awarded to KJP Trading for the supply of furniture to various South African Police Service offices across the country for two years. Naidoo stands accused of initiating talks between the investigators and the two businessmen to iron out or halt investigations on 12 March at the premises of KJP Traders. This happened after cops found that KJP Traders was manufacturing poor quality office furniture while, in the tender document, they had said they would source the furniture from reputable companies. Naidoo allegedly promised the investigators that Govender and Pillay were willing to pay R5 million bribe in instalments. For his middleman role he allegedly wanted a R500 000 cut. The cops set up a sting operation where meetings were recorded. On 14 April, the businessmen gave Naidoo R1,8 million and he allegedly took R300 000 for himself and delivered R1,5 million to the undercover police officers. The three were arrested at the weekend. Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant General Nomthetheleli Mene said: “Those who continue to steal from the coffers of government institutions must be made to face the consequences of their actions. This is one of the examples we have made and more will be made.” The case was postponed to Tuesday, 24 May.
