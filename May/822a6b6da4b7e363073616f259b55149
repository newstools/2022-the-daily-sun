GONE are the days when children at creches ate, slept, prayed and went home. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has said the migration of early childhood development centres from the social development to the education department would see kids being taught programming, maths and science. “We want these kids to be able to compete on the global stage. The purpose of migration is to fix a foundation, which will eliminate the issues of extra lessons when they are in grade 11 and 12,” he said. He said strengthening the foundation phase of education started with a re-skilled educational workforce. “Practitioners must be re-skilled and have the right qualifications to teach our children,” he said. “We have 488 education students who are about to graduate and will all be absorbed into the system.” ALSO READ | Three kids die after drinking energy drink! MEC Lesufi was speaking at David Bopape Early Childhood Development Centre in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, on Thursday 26 March. The migration process started on 1 April. “To those migrating, they are promised green pastures. We are going to make life easier for you,” said the MEC. Lesufi said 1 044 primary schools in Gauteng were expected to have early childhood development classes soon. Lesufi said five state-of-the-art centres would be built in Soshanguve in Tshwane, Ratanda in Heidelberg, Tembisa in Ekurhuleni, Bekkersdal in the Rand West City and Braamfischerville in Soweto. He said his department would work with the health department to collect data about the kids because it was important to catch health problems at an early age.
