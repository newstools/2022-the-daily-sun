THE tombstone of former Bafana Bafana captain, Senzo Meyiwa, will be renovated within three months. South African Football Association’s (Safa) KZN spokesman and co-ordinator of the tombstone project, Kwenza Ngwenya, said lockdown delayed plans to fix the grave, which was vandalised at Heroes Acre Cemetery in Durban in December 2020. He saidwhen lockdown regulations were lifted, they started the project but it was delayed again by the KZN floods. “The tombstone company in Pietermaritzburg recently went to check the grave but then the floods happened.” ALSO READ: SENZO'S GRAVE DESTOYED! When asked about security, Ngwenya said they’d discussed it. “We’ll try and fence it in a way that thugs don’t have access to it. It cost Safa R160 000 for the tombstone alone, excluding the cost of unveiling. For it to be vandalised like that, days after the unveiling, was a shock. “You must remember that Safa is not obliged to install this tombstone. We are doing it because Senzo played for the national team. This work is from the goodness of Safa’s heart.” Senzo’s brother, Sifiso, said the family would be very happy when the tombstone was installed. He said: “That will bring dignity to my brother. Let’s just pray nothing disturbs the project again.”
