MURDER accused Philemon Lukhele has been moved to Maximum Prison Barberton after he was found in possession of a mobile phone on Tuesday, 24 May. Lukhele had been detained at the Mbombela Correctional Services since his arrest early this month. The 47-year-old and his two co-accused are facing charges of rape, murder, conspiracy, kidnapping as well as defeating the ends of justice following the murder of Hillary Gardee. The 28-year-old’s lifeless body was found dumped at a timber plantation outside Mbombela a few days after she was reported missing. In a statement, the Department of Correctional Services said an investigation was currently underway to ascertain the circumstances under which the phone was smuggled and people involved. “Mobile phones are classified as a contraband inside correctional facilities, thus making them unauthorised. For the country to have safe and secure correctional centres, we expect nothing but strict adherence to safety standards from all those who interface with the department. Hence, visitors, inmates, officials and private citizens caught contravening our regulations shall be dealt with through the criminal justice system. Those involved in the smuggling of contraband shall never be spared any mercy,” read the statement. A criminal case has also been registered with the police.
