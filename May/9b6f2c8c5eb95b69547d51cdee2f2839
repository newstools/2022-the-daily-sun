GAUTENG police have made a breakthrough after arresting a group of fong-kong police suspected to be behind armed robberies and hijackings in the province. The group was arrested in Lanseria on Sunday, 29 May, after they were found with unlicensed firearms, ammunition and police uniform. Police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Masondo, said: “The suspects, aged between 26 and 36, are linked with various cases where victims are robbed and hijacked by people wearing police uniform.” Masondo said police gathered information about the suspects that wait at a petrol station to prey on unsuspecting motorists and subsequently hijack and rob them at gunpoint. Information on the planned hijacking that was to happen on Sunday night was shared with the operatives. “A team comprising of members from SAPS Tactical Response Team, Gauteng Crime Intelligence, West Rand Flying Squad, Tracker Connect, Vision Tactical, Guardmax Security and BCI Security came together to intercept the suspects. “As the team was keeping a close observation, they spotted a blue Mazda that matched the description of the suspects’ vehicle and followed it until it stopped at the petrol station in Lanseria,” he said. He said upon searching the five occupants and the car, police found two unlicensed firearms (a shotgun and pistol), ammunition and police uniform. Suspects were arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, possession of suspected stolen property, impersonating police officers, and conspiracy to commit a crime. Gauteng provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, has praised the collaboration between the police and private security companies through the Eyes and Ears Project. Masondo said the suspects are expected to appear before the Randburg Magistrates Court tomorrow, 31 May.
