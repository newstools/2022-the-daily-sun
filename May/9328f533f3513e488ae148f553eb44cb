TWO Eastern Cape cops were arrested for alleged drunk driving after they were involved in an accident. The two officers stationed at Maletswai Police Station in Aliwal North appeared in a video circulating on social media. In the video, the cops are seen sitting in a van apparently drunk and struggling to speak when they are approached by a road construction employee, after allegedly causing an accident at a stop and go outside Lady Grey.  Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana told Daily Sun that the incident happened on Thursday, 26 May on the R58 between Aliwal North and Lady Grey. It is alleged that the officers failed to stop and as a result, they almost ran over two women working at the road construction site in that area. On arrival at the scene, police immediately arrested a constable (31) for reckless and negligent driving with a state vehicle and both of them, including the warrant officer (56), for being under the influence of liquor while on duty.  No one was injured during the accident. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nomthetheleli Mene said: “The conduct of these members goes against the spirit and letter of the police Code of Conduct and is furthermore injurious to the image of the police. The members will face disciplinary action. We would also like to thank the members of the public for their courage to report the unprofessional conduct of the police,” she said.
