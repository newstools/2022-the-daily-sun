KRAAIFONTEIN cops have arrested a man after a shoot-out on Sunday, 29 May. Patrolling cops were busy with their rounds near La Boheme Street in Wallacedene in the Western Cape when they noticed three men standing in the street. According to police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi, when the cops approached the men, one suspect fired gunshots and fatally wounded the victim who was standing with them. “The suspect then fired gunshots at the police and fled. The police members returned fire and gave chase and arrested the suspect, confiscating a firearm with ammunition and an imitation firearm,” said Swartbooi. He said the 36-year-old man was arrested and detained on charges of murder, attempted murder, pointing of firearm, and possession of prohibited firearm and ammunition. In a separate incident, cops in Maitland, who were on rest days on Sunday, 29 May, received information about a firearm. “The members booked themselves on duty and searched premises in Kraaifontein. They confiscated a firearm, without a serial number. A 17-year-old man was arrested and detained on a charge of possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition,” said Swartbooi. Both suspects are expected to make their respective court appearances in the Blue Downs Magistrates Court soon.
