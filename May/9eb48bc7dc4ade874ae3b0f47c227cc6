WHEN gogo Madeline Nyathi (63) had a strange dream, she didn’t know she was being prepared for something that would happen. In her dream, two big men wearing black clothes cornered her and her friend in a mielie field and tried to force them into a car. But gogo Madeline and her friend Zelda Mtshwene (66) from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni managed to break free and ran to the road to get help. Gogo Madeline said she and gogo Zelda were harvesting beans at their maize meal field in Etwatwa. And just like in the dream two huge men in black clothes arrived in a Ford Ranger. “They tried to force us into their car but we broke free and ran to the road where we asked mechanics who work on the side of the road to help us,” she said. They said the Ranger went into the kasi and disappeared. “I had a vision the night beforem but I didn’t know it was preparing me for this.” She said moments before the two men attacked, she felt uneasy. “I even told my friend that I had an uneasy feeling and wanted to go. I knew the angels were guarding us,” she said. “I imagine what could have happened had those men managed to get us into their car. Maybe they could have killed us and removed our body parts.” Gogo Zelda, who is a Christian, said every time she leaves her home she prays. The two gogos said they were scared because they didn’t know who those men are and where they live. She said they saw them because their faces were uncovered.
