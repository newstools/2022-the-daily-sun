AMAKHOSI are not happy with the Mpumalanga Department of Traditional Affairs. Provincial Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) deputy chairman Prince Mcebo Dlamini said they were fed up with the department sticking its nose into the affairs of traditional leaders and royal families. “We are very concerned about the tendency of the department of partially firing or removing amakhosi from thrones. We can’t take it anymore. “We are calling for Contralesa president Kgoshi Mathibela Mokoena to intervene,” he said. “It is unfair for inkosi to be fired through a phone call by department officials. We are tired of pushing a stuck wheelbarrow,” said Dlamini. His call was supported by Inkosi Mbangiso Mdluli of the Mpumalanga House of Traditional Leaders. “Our dignity as amakhosi will be restored,” he said. Mokoena said during Contralesa’s national conference, he became emotional when amakhosi from all provinces said they wanted him to lead them. “Now I am going to show that I love them back,” he said. Tim Mashele, an African National Congress MP and provincial executive committee member, said traditional leaders involved the courts and politicians in their disputes. “When you are true to the culture and traditions of Africa, you can’t go to court and rely on a judge to resolve issues of leadership positions,” he said.
