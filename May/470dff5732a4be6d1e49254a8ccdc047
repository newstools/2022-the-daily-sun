A NEWBORN baby was found abandoned behind an electric transformer next to Carolina Hospital in Mpumalanga. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said on Friday, 20 May, cops received a complaint at 7.30pm about an abandoned baby boy being found wrapped in a blanket. “It’s alleged that a security officer at Carolina Hospital posted to work at the gate was called by a passerby. “The person alerted the guard about a baby boy who was left without care behind an electricity transformer next to the hospital’s fence,” Mohlala said. It’s believed that the baby was a day old. “He was found clothed in a vest and trousers, and was wrapped with a blanket. “The child was taken inside the hospital for medical care. Upon the police’s arrival, a case of child neglect was opened. “Police have launched a manhunt for the child’s mother,” Mohlala said. He said preliminary investigations so far suggest that the mother could have given birth to the baby at a nearby hospital, as the records at the said hospital did not have information on recent child births. Police urge anyone who might have any information regarding the incident to contact Detective Sergeant Mmeli Nkosi on of Elukwatini Family Violence Unit 071 177 0927. Alternatively, members of the public can call CrimeStop on 08600 10111. Mpumalanga police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Daphney Manamela, condemned the incident. “Bearing in mind the socio-economic challenges that women face on daily basis, however, that does not permit them to neglect or abandon their children. “Therefore, the law will have to take its course on this one because police are there to protect the vulnerable and, in this case, the infant,” Manamela said.
