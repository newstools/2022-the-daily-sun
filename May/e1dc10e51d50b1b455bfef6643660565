TWO suspects were arrested and three unlicensed firearms were recovered after a courier vehicle was robbed in Joburg on Monday, 23 May. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said cops were patrolling around Germiston when they received information about a courier vehicle that was robbed by four suspects driving in a white Audi. Masondo said the vehicle was travelling towards Pretoria along the N3. “The police followed the vehicle until the suspects took the Marlboro off-ramp. As the police were approaching, the suspects stopped and jumped out, running in different directions,” Masondo said in a statement. He said the suspects reportedly started shooting at the police who returned fire. “One suspect sustained a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital and is under police guard, while the second suspect was detained. Three unlicensed firearms and cellphones to the estimated value of R200 000 were recovered,” said Masondo. The vehicle driven by the suspects was reportedly hijacked in Yeoville, Joburg. Cops are still looking for the remaining suspects who managed to evade arrest. “The arrested suspects will be charged with possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, possession of a reportedly hijacked vehicle, attempted murder, and possession of suspected stolen property,” said Masondo.
