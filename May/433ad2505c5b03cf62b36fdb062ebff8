THE prices of petrol continue to skyrocket throughout the world. As a result, the Concerned Drivers Association in Ghana has resorted to a naked march scheduled for 1 June in the Greater Accra Region. In a statement, Ashanti regional chairman Akwadaa Nyame said they had already had talks with the Ghana police and other stakeholders who gave them the green light. “We are calling on all our associations to support our national executives amid this rampant increment in fuel prices. Buses will be made available at vantage places to mobile members to Accra. There has been the need for this demonstration because our transport business is collapsing due to a rampant increase in the price of fuel, lubricants and spare parts,” Nyame said in a statement. He said many drivers have become unemployed because they can’t make their daily profits and the cars end up retrieved by the owners. “The economic hardship breeds confusion between us and our clients, especially when there is an increase in fares. We say enough is enough. Coming 1st June 2022, we are registering our displeasure with a naked demonstration,” said Nyame.
