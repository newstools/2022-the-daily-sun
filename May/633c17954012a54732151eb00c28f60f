ANGRY members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) say they will continue to camp outside the Union Buildings until President Cyril Ramaphosa gives them what they want. From Thursday, 19 May, they have been braving the cold weather in Tshwane along with Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) members. They are demanding that the president keep his promise of negotiating with their employer to give them a R1 000 salary increase. The employees of Sibanye-Stillwater said on Workers’ Day, the president made the promise and they would not let him off the hook. NUM branch secretary for Sibanye-Stillwater Sipho Soshangane said: “What our members are demanding is an increase in their salaries, considering the fact that the price of everything has gone up. We are hoping to achieve more than the R800 we were offered because we believe the president has the means to address this matter.” Worker Phuthuma Mankabane said they were gatvol of being ignored and would not leave until Ramaphosa addressed them. “Our employer doesn’t care about us and we are relying on the president to give us answers,” he said. Phuthuma said the R800 increase they were offered was too little. “We pleaded with the president on May Day and he agreed that he would address our concerns. All we need is a R1 000 increase because we work so hard and believe we deserve it,” he said. The SunTeam sent queries to the president’s spokesman Tyrone Seale but he didn’t respond.
