HE waited for their mother to leave for work, then their father called his five children to give them an energy drink, that his fourth son refused to drink. When they got to school, the four kids who had consumed the drink started getting sick. They complained of stomach pains, and teachers called the ambulance. Sadly, two of them, who were pupils at Khanya-Lesedi Secondary School in Ratanda, died before it could arrive. A few minutes later, the six-year-old at Ratanda Primary School died, and his elder brother is fighting for his life in hospital. The grief-stricken mum now only has one healthy son, who didn’t drink it. The grandfather said they were still trying to make sense of it all. “The father was a very quiet person, and we still don’t know what led him to doing this disturbing act. He even fed the drink to his dog, and it has also died. We suspect he planned this because on the day of the incident, he didn’t go to work.” The father, who is in hospital after drinking pills to allegedly commit suicide, was working as an electrician while the 34-year-old mum is working at a feeding scheme at a school. She told Daily Sun that her husband was not abusive, and they were on good terms before the incident. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the family to console them, and promised that the department would help with funeral costs. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said police had opened a case of murder and attempted murder. “The four kids are alleged to have consumed a poison-infused drink,” he said.
