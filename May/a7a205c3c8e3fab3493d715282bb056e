On Tuesday 31 May, the players and management were at the Mam’s Mall in Mamelodi Tshwane where they interreacted with their fans after yet another victory of the Premiership title. Scores and scores of Sundowns fans gathered at the said Mall to meet their favorite team and players in celebrating with them.It was a meet and greet moment filled with lots of selfies as the fans queued-up to have a chance with the champions.  Speaking to Daily Sun, Mamelodi Sundowns Goalkeeper and Captain, Denis Onyango, said they were happy to win yet another league title. “Of course, any team and player would be happy to win the league, we have seen Orlando Pirates doing it, so we also get encouraged by such a team. “We would always want to go for another one and it is always good to give our best. Unfortunately we are out of the Champions league, we moved on from that and we had to go and deliver on the trophy that is available. “For us any trophy is important to the club, it doesn’t matter which trophy it is, we don’t choose trophies, but we always push ourselves to win, and we thank our fans for supporting us all the time,” said Onyango.  Sundowns fan, Brian Selemela (42), who also stays in Mamelodi says he had to take a day off at work to come and meet the Champions. “Well, I love this team and it doesn’t disappoint. I came to meet them in person and yes I did not even go to work today after learning that they will be here. I came to celebrate with them on yet another victory. The sky is the limit,” said Brian.  Sundowns sealed their DStv Premiership title after a goalless draw with Cape Town City at Loftus Stadium.They won the league still having four matches to spare.
