FOR a very long time, parents of children at Kwanyamazane Primary School in Dukuduku Village in Mtubatuba, KZN, sent their kids to school with heavy hearts. They feared their children would be killed by the collapsing classrooms. They said the classroom walls have huge cracks and during windy days, the building shakes. But on Tuesday, 24 May, KZN education MEC Kwazi Mshengu announced that the school will soon be demolished and construction will start in October. Mshengu’s inspection came shortly after Daily Sun published the story last month. During his budget speech, Mshengu said this school formed part of the planned infrastructure programmes. During his inspection at the school, Mshengu was shocked about the dangerous conditions. “When I was told about the school, I had to come and see it myself. The conditions are horrible. No one should be allowed inside those wall,” said Mshengu. Earlier this month the department sent mobile classrooms to the school as a temporary solution. “We could not allow teaching and learning to continue in those classrooms. The school will be demolished and rebuilt. We have secured money to start construction,” said Mshengu. A parent, Ntombizethu Mkhwanazi (39), said: “We are happy that our children don’t have to miss school when it rains.” No comment was obtained from the chairman of the SGB as his phone was on voicemail.
