The North Gauteng High Court of South Africa in Pretoria has
deferred the R1.8bn BOSASA and Department of Correctional Services (DCS) fraud
and corruption matter to 22 July 2022. This is after Linda Mti, former DCS Chief Financial Officer
(CFO), and Patrick Gillingham, former BOSASA CFO, requested a postponement in
order to sort out their financial situation to continue paying their legal
teams. The matter relates to four tenders awarded to BOSASA and its
subsidiaries between August 2004 and 2007. The tender was for rendering catering and training services,
installation of CCTV cameras, installing the perimeter fencing and supplying a
television system and monitoring equipment. Other accused in the matter are Andries Van Tonder,
Commissioner of Correctional Services, and former BOSASA COO, Angelo Agrizzi. Agrizzi was once again not in attendance. Investigating Directorate spokeswoman, Sindisiwe Seboka,
said the pulmonologist (a doctor who diagnoses and treats diseases of the
respiratory system) appointed by the state has assessed Agrizzi and the outcome
of the assessment will be heard as a separate matter on 12 July 2022. She said Agrizzi further requested further particulars and
the state will comply.
