ANGRY residents have beaten a man to death after accusing him of an attempted abduction. The community cornered the vehicle with three occupants inside, and two managed to flee. One was caught and beaten to death before his body was set alight next to the car he was driving, which also burnt to ashes. Graphic videos of the crowd setting alight a man and his car have since gone viral on social media. The incident happened on corner Hyde Road and the M5 highway in Parkwood, Cape Town, on Tuesday, 31 May. A woman can be heard shouting: “This is the culprit; we caught him” while other people are shouting: “Enough is enough”. Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed the incident, adding that cops were still investigating. “Grassy Park police responded to a complaint at about 11am. Upon arrival, they found a Toyota Avanza in flames and the body of an unknown man, who had died from injuries sustained due to the fire,” said Swartbooi. He added that according to reports, three unknown men were driving in the area when they were attacked by community members who then set their car alight. “Two men managed to flee the scene. The suspects are yet to be arrested. The motive for the attack is unknown, and cops have registered a case of murder for further investigation,” said Swartbooi.
