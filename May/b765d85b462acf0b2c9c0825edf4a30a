NORTH WEST police are on high alert after community members in Morokweng Village outside Vryburg allegedly set alight a house with three men inside on Tuesday afternoon, 24 May. According to Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone, reports suggest that an angry mob went to a rented house at Ga-Mokgopha section where the three men accused of drug dealing stayed. “The house was allegedly pelted with stones and in the process of escaping the attack, the victims allegedly stabbed and injured some of the community members. The group then chased the men who were accused of dealing in drugs and caught them. They were then taken back to the house, which was eventually set alight with the trio inside,” said Mokgwabone.
