SHE went from being a successful businesswoman to working as a cashier. She was also happily married with three kids but she and her husband got divorced. The 47-year-old woman from Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, believes mabhebeza is the reason her life turned upside down. She told Daily Sun she got mabhebeza in 2020 and things were going well until she left for KZN to bury her mum. As she was the only one who knew about it, she couldn’t instruct her family members to make tea for it. “I had two shisanyama outlets in Ekurhuleni, a salon in Sandton and a fashion store in Jozi,” she said. The woman said when she came back from KZN, her husband started to act up. “It was like he hated me. He even started sleeping in another room. A lot of things happened and we ended up divorcing,” she said. She said her kids lived in KZN with her sister and her husband only saw them once every two months. “We don’t even communicate any more. He just sends money straight to my sister. It’s like he went from being a loving husband to being very hateful towards me,” she said. The woman said the friend who recommended mabhebeza went back to Mozambique and she couldn’t get hold of her. She warned SunReaders to stay away from this creature. “One mistake and it’ll ruin your life,” she said. Sangoma Mkhulu Magabade Mnisi explained that mabhebeza was an amoeba found in water. She said it had to be fed rooibos tea and when it gave birth, the baby had to be given to someone close to you. “The lady can come and be cleansed properly. She won’t get her old life back but the dark shadow will be gone,” she said.
