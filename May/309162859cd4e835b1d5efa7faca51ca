Police spokesman Captain Makgowanyana Maja said police in the Randburg policing precinct have noted with concern the number of hijackings in certain intersections. “More especially along the Malibongwe street and N1 both on and off ramps. “William Nicol both on and off ramp including the stretch of N1 north and south between Malibongwe and William Nicol roads.” He said the suspects operate in a group of two to four and use a white Ford Ranger and/or a white VW Polo and also use a blue light. “The other vehicles are blue/ white/silver Toyota Corollas, grey Nissan Navara and Nissan Almera. “The victims are held against their will and dropped off in different areas around Gauteng.” Maja shared some safety tips: Do not stop for anyone if you suspect that the person might be a bogus officer. Drive to the nearest Police station, shopping complex or any other busy area. Do not drive to your residential area. Do not stop at a deserted spot or area to talk on your phone or even relieve yourself. Always keep your windows closed. If someone tries to force you off the road, don't panic but just blow your horn constantly to draw attention. In addition to the above, be aware of the theft from motor vehicles especially Volkswagen Polo headlights which has seemingly started to surface. Make sure you park your vehicle in a visible area or where there are car guards or a locked plac
