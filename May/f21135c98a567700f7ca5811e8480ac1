SINGER and songwriter Andile Mpisane’s performance has been received with unpopularity. This as his audience was captured on video, busy on their phones and some talking to each other while he was performing on stage at Propaganda club in Tshwane. WATCH: Mamkhize's granddaughter living the soft life! The video was shared all over social media, and has since gone viral. It left partygoers seemingly wondering what he was doing on stage, and Tweeps sharing their opinions after seeing it. Andile Mpisane will never go back to Propaganda after this shem?????????????????? pic.twitter.com/G00Qdav5E6  Social media user Simtho Biyela said Andile wanted to take over everything – from being the chairman of family football club Royal AM and husband to artist, soccer player and dancer. Then Bekithemba Zulu said: “But very observant people already know that Andile is not an entertainer, especially a live performer for a young vibrant audience.” Mfoka Jobe added: “I wish I can meet and advise him to use his money to fund up-and-coming artists who are talented and build something he will be proud of, not this nonsense of abusing his connections and platforms.” The 21-year-old has a few songs under his belt. In 2020, he released a single, titled Umcimbi. His mum Shauwn “MaMkhize” Mkhize supported his career and even appeared on one of his music videos. Some of his songs include It’s Too Much Sauce, Inkosi and Uyangqhaska.
