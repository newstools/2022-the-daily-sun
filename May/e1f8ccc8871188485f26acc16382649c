ANGRY protesters burnt three trucks on Tuesday 24 May. The latest incident in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, brought the number of trucks set alight since the start of protests in the area a week ago to five. Protesters who blocked roads with branches, rocks and other objects are demanding tarred roads, electricity and water. Bushbuckridge Mayor Sylvia Nxumalo strongly condemned the criminal behaviour. “The municipality is disappointed that after every effort by the municipality and the public works, roads and transport department to engage with them, the community of Marongwane has continued launching attacks on the road and business community. “We are calling on law enforcement agencies to bring these criminals to book,” she said. The mayor warned members of the community to stop engaging in criminal activities. Nxumalo said criminality and hooliganism had a negative impact on the local economy and scared away potential investors and tourists. “I also urge motorists to refrain from reckless behaviour on local roads, following several accidents on the R40. I have requested traffic officials to enforce traffic laws without exceptions,” she said. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed there was a blockade of the R40 Road at Marite Nkanini due to protests. “The R40 Road was closed but later, traffic officials assisted in controlling motorists. The police are following leads and hope to make arrests soon,” he said.
