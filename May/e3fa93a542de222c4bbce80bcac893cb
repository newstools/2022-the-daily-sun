CONVICTED killer Rosemary Nomia Ndlovu made a brief appearance in the Kempton Park Magistrates court on Wednesday, 25 May. Ndlovu is facing two separate murder cases. In the first matter she is charged with conspiracy to murder two police officers who were investigating her murder spree. In the second matter, Ndlovu is accused with police officer Nomsa Mudau of attempting to murder Justice Mudau in 2018. Justice and Nomsa were married at the time. The matters were postponed to Tuesday for the accused to have access to the docket. Nomsa failed to appear in court and it was revealed that she was on the run. A warrant of her arrest has been issued. Ndlovu made her first appearance on 20 April. Rosemary told the court that she did not know why she was brought court. She allegedly plotted to kill two police officers, Sergeant Benneth Mabunda and colonel Nthipe Boloka. Mabunda was the investigating officer in her case, while Boloka was the Tembisa Police Station’s commander where Rosemary worked. The plot was hatched shortly after she was arrested in March 2018. The attempts were made while Rosemary was still working as a cop at the Thembisa cop shop. She is currently serving a life term at the Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre after she was handed six life sentences for the murders of six relatives she had killed for insurance payouts.
