A 59-YEAR-OLD man is expected to appear in court after he was caught red-handed with a dead stolen cow on Tuesday, 24 May. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said a cattle herder became suspicious when he noticed a slaughtered cow in the bushes in Charl Cilliers in Secunda, Mpumalanga and immediately called the owner. “The owner alerted the police and other stakeholders in the fight against crime in the area,” he said. When the team arrived, they spotted a Toyota Yaris and an unknown man on the grazing field next to the carcass of the cow. The farmer confirmed the cow was his and the man was arrested. Stock theft is a serious problem in many parts of the country, especially in areas bordering neighbouring countries. In extreme cases, livestock farmers have been put out of business through the theft of their cattle. “Police regard his arrest as a breakthrough that will lead to unresolved cases and other similar cases of stock theft in the surrounding areas to be solved. The man may be linked to other cases. The investigation continues,” he said. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant General Semakaleng Manamela said she appreciated the partnership between the police, the community police forums and local farmers. She has reassured the affected communities the police are working hard to fight stock theft. “We are making notable inroads in curbing stock theft. We continue to encourage people not to buy stolen meat,” she said.
