THE family of Annah Skhosana (48) is having sleeplessness nights. Annah went missing on Friday on her way to work. Her husband Jan Skhosana (48) said nobody knows where she went. He said he left her in the house when he went to catch the bus in the early hours of Friday, 20 May. Jan from Thokoza Village in Tweefontein near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, said the family is praying that she is found alive. “On Friday I tried to call my wife during tea break but she didn’t answer her phone. I called her again during lunch time but still she didn’t answer. I thought maybe she forgot her phone at home. We catch the same bus after work but she wasn’t there. When I arrived at home that evening she wasn’t there. “I am now worried sick because I don’t know what could have happened to her. Everybody in the house is very worried and we have sleeplessness nights. I have tried to call her on both her phones but they are switched off. I have even checked with our close relatives but none of them have seen her,” he said. Annah’s daughter Nelly Skhosana (28) told Daily Sun her mum was last seen in the yard by a neighbour. “Our neighbour told us that she saw her fetching water from the tap on Friday at around seven o’clock in the morning. We called her workplace but they told us she didn’t report to work. We pray that wherever she is, she is fine,” she said. Nelly said her parents used to catch the bus together in the morning when going to work. She said on Friday her mum remained behind and was supposed to catch the bus later. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed a file of a missing person has been opened. He said the police are investigating.
