FRAUD and corruption in Mzansi are a pandemic on their own, but what this man did takes it to another level. Amos Motlokwe Molatudi (35) was convicted and referred to Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital by the Emalahleni Regional Court on Wednesday, 25 May. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the court ordered that Molatudi be detained in the Witbank Correctional Services until his transfer to Weskoppies. Furthermore, he could only be released from the institution through an order by a High Court judge. This conviction followed an incident that happened in July 2020, where Molatudi reportedly sent emails to several Hawks officials in Mpumalanga. “The emails, with an attachment, were containing a supposed ‘High Court order’ and letter. They were allegedly from the presidency, stating that a vehicle seized from Sam Tshabalala should be released to him,” said Sekgotodi. The initial investigation established that the said order was fake, and investigators set up a sting operation under the guise of collection of the Mercedes-Benz G-wagon at Witbank Police Station, where he was arrested upon arrival in September.
