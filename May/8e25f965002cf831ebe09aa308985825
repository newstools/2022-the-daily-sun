FIVE men including a Home Affairs official are due to appear in the White River Magistrates Court for a formal bail application on Wednesday, 25 May. They were arrested for fraud and corruption and contravening the Immigration Act. They made the their first appearance on Friday, 20 May but were remanded in custody. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the five men were arrested by the Hawks’ serious corruption investigating team in Eldorado Park, Joburg and White River on Thursday, 19 May. “Investigations revealed that on 13 October 2021, one of the accused colluded with the alleged kingpin from Pakistan, who recruited South African citizens to offer their personal details in order for foreigners to get South African passports in exchange for payment. “South African citizens would use their particulars and prints to apply for the said passports but when it came to capturing the photo, foreigners would be captured. This was reportedly facilitated by Home Affairs officials after hours,” said Sekgotodi. She said more arrests were expected as investigations continue.
