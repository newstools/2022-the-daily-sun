ANDRE Schalkwyk is happy to be living ekasi. The 28-year-old mlungu told Daily Sun: “This is the perfect place for me.” He said the people of Marikana informal settlement in Centurion, Tshwane, treated him well and were kind. “The people have become my family. I enjoy their company,” he said. Andre, originally from Bella Bella in Limpopo, has been living in the area for about 18 months. He said he wanted to fulfil his childhood dream of being a successful businessman. “I learn new things all the time. The people in the shacks have shown me the other side of life,” he said. “Here we hustle. We survive by selling scrap and recycling. We dust ourselves off every morning and go out to do things that will put food on the table. I am proud of these people.” Andre left home because his parents were struggling and he didn’t want to be a burden to them. “God is looking after me. When I have some money, I buy my favourite meat, a T-bone steak,” he said. Andre said he planned on getting married and having a family. “Life has its ups and downs but one must keep the focus as there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” he said. Residents described Andre as a cool guy who’s always happy. Resident Simon Mathiba (29) said: “Andre loves this community. After work, he chills with the residents. When he’s around us, you can’t even think of him as a mlungu. He is a smart recycler.” Mpho Maluleka (43) said: “We learn things from Andre. He is our mlungu.”
