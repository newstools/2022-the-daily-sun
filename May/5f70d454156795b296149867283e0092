Dating sites have become gold mines for scammers. A man, who cannot be named to protect his identity, fell
victim to a scam where a man pretended to be an Italian woman. The relationship escalated to a point where the female
impersonator asked that they exchange naked pictures and videos. The man obliged. After receiving the pictures, the scammer revealed his
gender and demanded payment of 800 US dollars threatening to circulate the
naked pictures on social media platforms. Chinedu Jonathan Madueka was arrested on 14 May and pleaded
guilty to charges of fraud and extortion. The Alexandra Magistrates Court sentenced to seven years on
Monday 30 May. The sentence was wholly suspended for five years on the
condition that he is not convicted of fraud and or extortion during the period
of suspension. Prosecutor Lufuno Godfrey Maphiri argued that the accused
misrepresented himself, and took advantage of the complainant's feelings. He
asked the court to send a strong message that the online scamming of innocent
and unsuspecting individuals will not be tolerated. The complainant was
satisfied that Madueka pleaded guilty and paid back the money he extorted from
him. "The National Prosecuting Authority commends the
collective work done by the investigator, Lieutenant Colonel Oscar William
Mopedi from the South African Police Service's Commercial Crimes Unit and
Maphiri that resulted in a successful prosecution," said National
Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane.
