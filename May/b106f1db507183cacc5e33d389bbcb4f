SINDISIWE Manqele, who was convicted for the murder of rapper Flabba, is out on parole. This was confirmed by the Department of Correctional Services on Tuesday, 24 May. Sindisiwe stabbed and killed her then boyfriend, Flabba, whose real name was Nkululeko Habedi, in 2015 after an alleged altercation. Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said: “The department is able to confirm that Ms Sindisiwe Precious Manqele has been placed on parole, effective from 24 May. “This decision was taken by the Correctional Supervision and Parole Board (CSPB), having assessed Manqele’s profile as submitted by the Case Management Committee and other material presented for the purposes of parole consideration.” Sindisiwe was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for murder in 2015. Nxumalo said: “In arriving at its decision, CSPB further took into consideration that Ms Manqele has a positive support system. “Her parole placement is in line with Section 73 of the Correctional Services Act, which determines the minimum period of sentence that must be served before consideration may be granted for possible placement.” He added: “Manqele takes responsibility for the offence she committed and is remorseful about it. She completed all the identified programmes as per her Correctional Sentence Plan and participated in the Victim- Offender-Dialogue in 2018. “It is critical to highlight that parole placement is not the end of the sentence as Manqele will complete the remainder of the sentence in the system of community corrections, whereby she is expected to comply with specific set of conditions and will be subjected to supervision until her sentence expires on 23 May 2028.” Nxumalo said parole placement formed part of the total rehabilitation programme in correcting offending behaviour, and may include continuation of programmes aimed at reintegration while in the system of community corrections.
