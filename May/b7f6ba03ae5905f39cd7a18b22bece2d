WHEN four men attacked a woman, allegedly to rob her, residents responded. Three of the men got away but one of them wasn’t so lucky. The Khayelitsha man was caught and beaten near the Burundi squatter camp, where the woman comes from. Residents also started a fire to burn the man but they couldn’t find a tyre, so they decided to drown him in a nearby river in the Mfuleni area instead. A 38-year-old woman told the SunTeam she arrived at the scene when the residents were beating up the man. “A resident said he was from C section and she knew him because he had robbed her of her car,” she said. “That made the residents more angry. I begged them for forgiveness on his behalf, but they were too angry.” She said they threw the bleeding man in the river. “A young man, who said he was his brother, arrived and took him out of the water but it was already too late. “Residents then left the scene and disappeared,” the woman said. The family of the man arrived and confirmed it was their son. They said he was 20 years old but they didn’t want to speak further. Another resident who spoke to the SunTeam said there was a huge group of residents. “Residents from Covid-19 and Burundi helped each other to chase and catch this boy,” he said. Police spokesperson Captain Frederick Van Wyk confirmed the incident. “Police are investigating a murder case after the body of an unknown male was found yesterday, 22 May, on Old Faure Road, Mfuleni, near a river, with head injuries. “Suspects and the motive are unknown circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation.
