LAST month, he survived a hijacking. But on Thursday 26 May, food delivery driver Leeto Ramollo woke up to find his bike stolen. He’s now wondering if the culprits are the same thugs. The 40-year-old from Protea Glen in Soweto said he was almost hijacked when three men in a silver Toyota Quantum pointed a gun at him after he stopped at a traffic light. They told him to hand over his Big Boy 150 CC and were about to drive off with it. But he was saved by three colleagues who appeared out of nowhere. The thugs backed off, got back into the Quantum taxi and sped off. “I’m not sure if the same guys followed me home,” he said. He said he woke up in the morning to find his bike missing. “It was enclosed in a small zozo hut, which they broke into to get the bike out,” he said. Leeto said the thugs broke down his fence to get the bike out of his yard. He opened a case at Protea Glen Police Station. Leeto said his kids were now facing hunger as the bike was his tool to put bread on the table. Protea Glen Police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng confirmed a case of theft was opened and cops were investigating. Another biker told the SunTeam thugs also pointed a gun at him in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, and took his cellphone. He said they didn’t take his bike when they saw it was old.
