ADVOCATE Malesela Teffo, who is representing four of the accused in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial, made a brief appearance at the Hillbrow Magistrates Court on 27 May for his trespassing and common assault matter. He had been dramatically arrested last month, just after the adjournment of the trial in the North Gauteng High Court. His arrest was due to failing to appear in court for his contempt case. Teffo was released on R10 000 bail after allegedly missing two court appearances. The first was in December, but was postponed to 10 February due to him contracting Covid-19. He then missed the new date because the investigating officer allegedly said he would appear in the Johannesburg Regional Court when he was to appear in Hillbrow. During his appearance, his Attorney TT Thobane told the court that there was an application made by Teffo for the magistrate to recuse himself. Thobane said there was currently a complaint laid against the magistrate, who said he knew nothing about it. The magistrate said the sitting was for the court to listen to an application by Teffo for his recusal and another one by the state. But both the state and defence told court that they were not ready to proceed with the matter, now postponed to 8 July.
