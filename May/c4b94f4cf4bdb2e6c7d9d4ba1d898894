A SANGOMA and two high ranking Hawks officers have been arrested for possession of illegal ammunition and suspected stolen property. Hawks’ spokeswoman Brigadier Thandi Mbambo said two national headquarters Hawks officers, a Lieutenant-Colonel and a Captain working at Supply Chain Management, are in police custody after they were arrested on 27 May by the Hawks’ National Priority Violent Crimes and Tactical Operations Management Section. Mbambo said: “Information about a Lieutenant-Colonel who intended to supply SAPS ammunition to a traditional healer was received, which culminated in a sting operation being conducted. “The female traditional healer (43) was subsequently arrested at her place of residence in Soshanguve on 27 May after an exchange was made.” The sangoma was charged with illegal possession of ammunition and possession of suspected stolen property following the seizure of other items suspected to belong to the state. Mbambo added: “Further investigation led to the arrest of a female Lieutenant-Colonel who was charged with theft and dealing in ammunition, while the female Captain was arrested and charged with defeating the ends of justice after it was discovered that she tried to conceal evidence in this matter. “The traditional healer will appear in the Pretoria North Magistrates Court, while the two members will appear in the Pretoria Central Magistrates Court on Monday, 30 May.” The Hawks’ national head, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya, said: “We expect all our members to be beyond reproach and will ensure that the alleged culprits face the full might of the law. We will continue to act without fear or favour regardless of the status of those who transgress the law.”
