WHEN the community of Suurman in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, discovered the half-naked body of a teenage girl, Kgomotso Masia’s family started to panic. This is because Kgomotso has been missing since she left home on Saturday, 21 May, saying she was going to a mall in Hammanskraal. Her family from Ramaphosa Village near Dirtig said they heard neighbours talking about how the body matched their 18-year-old daughter’s description. Kgomotso’s mother, Esther (38), said: “I went to Temba Police Station to find out more, but they referred me to the Dr George Mukhari Hospital mortuary and when I got there, it was like I was seeing a horror scene. My first child was burnt with acid and had bruises,” she said. Kgomotso’s grandmother, Sebolaishi (64), said she had a bad feeling when her grandchild told her she was going to the mall. “There was so much I was looking forward to seeing her achieve. She had promised to build me a house but that will never happen,” said the gogo. Sergeant Herman Moremi of Temba Police Station said a case of murder was being investigated. “It is suspected that some liquid was poured over the body and clothes. At this stage, the motive for the killing is still unknown and no one has been arrested,” said Moremi. Police appealed to anyone with information that can help with investigations to call 08600 10111.
