AN Eastern Cape top government employee accused of bribing investigators will know on Thursday, 26 May, whether he’s been granted bail. Neil Naidoo, who is a director in the Department of Community Safety and Liaison, allegedly promised cops R3,5 million to halt their investigations into a multimillion-rand national police tender. The East London Magistrates Court is expected to hand down a bail judgment on the matter. Naidoo and his two co-accused businessmen Kenny Govender and Matthew Pillay brought their application on Tuesday, 24 May. The trio is facing charges of corruption, theft and defeating the ends of justice. They were arrested at the weekend. Govender and Pillay were being investigated for corruption in relation to a R36 million contract awarded to their company KJP Trading Pty Ltd for the supply of furniture to various South African Police Service offices across the country for two years. Naidoo allegedly initiated talks between the investigators and the two businessmen to iron out or halt investigations on 12 March. He allegedly told the investigators that Govender and Pillay were willing to pay R5 million bribe to quash the case. For his role he allegedly wanted R500 000 cut from the investigators.
