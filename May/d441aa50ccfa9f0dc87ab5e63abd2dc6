TODAY, an 11-year-old is fighting for his life in a Vosloorus hospital after allegedly being poisoned by his father. Three of the boy’s brothers, aged six, 13 and 16, died after drinking an energy drink allegedly laced with poison. A fifth brother refused the drink. The father is in hospital in Heidelberg after apparently trying to kill himself. Details around this horrific event are still emerging, but it has spine-chilling similarities to a spate of recent child killings in Mzansi. In many of those cases, children were killed for revenge when a woman left or intended to leave her partner or husband. ALSO READ | Bus crash claims ten lives! These killings suggest there’s something terribly wrong with the male psyche: a desire to control that cannot be controlled itself. It is beyond time that South African men themselves confronted this problem. They need to look in the mirror and address the attitudes that give rise to the monsters among them. And then they need to campaign against them. It is only by educating ourselves that we can move past this madness.
