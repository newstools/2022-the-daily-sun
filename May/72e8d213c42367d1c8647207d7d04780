A 35-year-old man will spend 20 years in jail for the murder of his baby mama. According to KZN police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala, on 7 July 2019, Noliswa Nhleko (22) was at her place of residence on Mthelekisi Road in Ntuzuma when she was murdered. The father of her daughter Mduduzi Mdukani (35) broke the door, window and assaulted her with a timber, a concrete pole on the face and head following a domestic dispute. “The mother succumbed to her injuries at the scene. A case of murder was opened for investigation at Ntuzuma Police Station. Mdukani left the area and went into hiding in Gauteng,” she said. In September 2019, cops in Gauteng arrested the accused for murder. He appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court and was remanded in custody. On 20 May 2022, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Ntuzuma Regional Court.
