THE Tshwane Metro Police Department’s ceremonial unit has arrested a notorious thug who has allegedly been terrorising the community of Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane. Spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said two members were performing their duties when they heard screams from a man in Masakeng Street in Ga-Rankuwa on Monday, 30 May. “They rushed to where the screams were coming from and found a young man bleeding from the head. He pointed them to two men with a bicycle. “He alerted officers that the two had just robbed him of his money, cellphone and bicycle, and then hit him on the head with a firearm,” said Mahamba. They chased the suspects, who left the bicycle and fled into the bushes. “The two officers apprehended one suspect, but one fled. As they were busy arresting the suspect, community members identified him as a notorious robber who often terrorised and robbed them as they walked to the mall,” he said. Mahamba said a resident alleged that he was robbed at gunpoint by the same suspect, who took his money, cellphone and clothes before assaulting him. “The officers managed to recover all items taken from the complainant. The suspect was arrested for armed robbery and will appear in court soon,” he said.
