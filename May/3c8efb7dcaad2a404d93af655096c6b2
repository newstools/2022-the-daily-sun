CONVICTED Saneliswe Phiwane, (23) was sentenced to double life
imprisonment for murder and robbery and an additional 5 years for kidnapping
and 10 years for defeating the end of justice by the Ntabankulu High Court at
Mount Fletcher on 26 May 2022. Police spokeswoman Captain
Ursula Roelofse said, “It is now believed that on the day of the incident, 13
September 2020, the deceased, 37-year-old Nombuso Tlhatsi, fell in a trap of
the accused to think that the accused wanted to propose love to her by
exchanging telephone numbers while the accused knew exactly that he wanted to
rob her of her motor vehicle. “Later on the day the accused
contacted the deceased to meet her at a nearby open field.” Roelofse said the deceased
arrived driving her Volkswagen Polo vehicle. After they had spoken for a while
she was overpowered and then strangled to death by the accused using a rope. The accused then placed the
deceased at the back of the car and drove her vehicle heading to Mount Frere. “Upon arrival at Mount Frere,
the accused dug a shallow grave at night along the Tina River between Qumbu and
Mount Frere and buried the deceased. “The following day the accused
together with his already sentenced co-accused were apprehended while loitering
up and down with the deceased’ Motor Vehicle at Mount Frere.” His co-accused pleaded guilty
during 2021 at Ntabankulu High court and is currently serving 30 years
imprisonment, while this accused pleaded not guilty to all the counts until he
was found guilty on all counts on the 26 May 2022.”
