THE family of a 13-year-old boy who was raped, allegedly by a patient in hospital, is demanding justice. The boy was admitted to Mamelodi Day Hospital on Saturday, 14 May, after he fractured his leg. He told Daily Sun a man climbed onto his bed from behind, put a knife to his neck and pulled down his trousers and raped him. The boy’s aunt (31) from Mamelodi, Tshwane, said she wanted to know why her nephew was put in a ward with adults. She said the suspect was in the bed next to the boy’s. “The ward was dark and no one helped my boy even when he was crying,” she said. “He was not okay when I went to see him. He complained that the man ate the food we brought him.” The aunt said the nurses didn’t answer her when she asked why the boy was put in an adult ward. She said that the suspect was taken to theatre with the boy. “The officials were rude when I complained about the theatre issue. I was told there was one door going to theatre and there was nothing they could do,” she said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said the suspect was arrested and appeared before court on Wednesday, 18 May. Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said hospital management was aware of the complaint and the matter was being probed by the department and cops.
