THE Maponapona Camp is set to tackle issues that affect men’s self-esteem such as having a small 4-5. The controversial naked hiking event will take place in the Drakensberg Mountains in QwaQwa, Free State, from 24 to 26 June. The three-day camp will also be dealing with unstable relationships, men addicted to magoshas, gender-based violence and personal development. Daily Sun spoke to two men, who didn’t want to be named, who will be taking part in the naked hike. One man (35) said his life was a mess and he struggled to find a girlfriend because of his small 4-5. “Three girls I was dating recently dumped me after having sex. I felt so humiliated when my last girlfriend wrote on Facebook that men with smaller 4-5s must feel free to become gay,” he said. “She did not mention my name but I knew she was referring to me. “I’m depressed and I’m going to join the naked hiking club in order to reclaim my manhood.” The second man (37) said he decided to stop dating because girls always hurt him. “I have a problem with early ejaculation, hence I opted to go to magoshas to satisfy my feelings. My family is always asking me to marry a woman to assist my 72-year-old mother. I don’t know where to start. I hope the naked hiking will help me,” he said. Event organiser Fana Lephakga (35) said this year’s event would be a bit different. “We decided to have a camp where men will be free to talk about their insecurities. Men have no platform to discuss these things. Everything is about women,” he said. “This is about personal development and our aim is to build brave men who will be able to fight against gender-based violence.”
