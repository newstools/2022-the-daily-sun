NATIONAL Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) general-secretary Irvin Jim has welcomed South African Federation of Trade Unions’ (Saftu) newly elected leadership and called for the federation to use the opportunity to unite. The congress pitted old friends Zwelinzima Vavi and Jim and was seen as a battle of who held more power within the federation. Jim, who leads the powerful Numsa affiliate, supported a slate that challenged Vavi’s slate and the outcome saw delegates elect leaders from both slates in the top five positions. “We have a duty and responsibility now moving forward to basically consolidate the federation and make sure that it becomes a shield and the spear in taking up battles and struggles for workers,” said Jim. Jim denied any personal clashes with Vavi, saying Vavi spread propaganda that he sent officials to spy on him after allegations emerged that Vavi was misappropriating federation funds. He shot down speculations that part of the division in the federation was caused by Vavi’s refusal not to enter the political space, whereas Jim wanted the federation to support the launch of a workers’ party to contest for state power. He claimed these rumours were deliberately being spread by some within the federation, saying it was no secret that the union has advocated for a workers’ party as far back as 2013 and when Saftu was launched, the union raised this with the intention to persuade the federation to warm to the idea of forming a mass party as an alternative to the ANC-led alliance. “But with the tensions and infighting that developed in the leadership of Saftu then there was this position taken by the general secretary in his defence. “Well, we all know what has been the issue,” he said. “So it has been the issue of transactions that are being questioned in defence of that.” Vavi survived a relentless push from Numsa when he was re-elected to his position, even though it was not a clean sweep.
