THE woman who was beaten inside the police
station, has withdrew the case in court against the man who was filmed kicking
and punching her. This was according to the Eastern Cape
Police after the video went viral on social media. The video also send shockwaves and also
gave an impression that the police didn’t act on the assault that happened
inside the station. Police also said that the said video, was
old and was not taken at the Madeira
Police Station but at Police Station in Sutterheim.    “According to
the report, the said incident occurred after four women and one man visited the
police station to complain about the other’s boyfriend who had assaulted his
girlfriend earlier in the tavern. ALSO READ: Woman moered by bae in front of cops! Kinana
further said, “It is further alleged that in the police station the boyfriend
arrived and started recording everyone whilst the report was being made. As he
was queried, he reacted by assaulting the girlfriend again and immediately
escaped. “However, the
police arrested him later for assault. The girlfriend returned to the police to
request that the case be withdrawn against the suspect at the time, but the
police told her that it was not the responsibility of the police to withdraw
cases. She was then referred to court where the charges were subsequently
withdrawn against the suspect.”   “Negligent
usage of social media may lead to a lawsuit especially where an individual has
been found to have lied or wrongly accused another person in public without
proven evidence,” he said.
