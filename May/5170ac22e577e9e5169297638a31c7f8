ON the night of Sunday, 22 May, Khayelitsha experienced its fourth mass shooting in just three months. Three siblings were shot and killed in their home in the Cape Town kasi by three gunmen who stormed in. Khayelitsha Development Forum chairman Ndithini Tyhido said over the previous year, 60 people had died in mass killings in the kasi. “Between May 2021 and May 2022, this last incident takes the number of people who have been killed in mass shootings to 60. “We are not sure yet about the motive for the latest shooting but we are concerned,” he said. The three victims were two men and a woman, aged between 51 and 57. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Novela Potelwa said: “It is alleged that two armed men in dark clothes stormed the home at 8.10pm and fired several shots. Information gathered from the scene indicates all three victims were siblings. No arrests have been made yet.” This incident came just weeks after six people were killed near a spaza shop in the Taiwan area on 8 May. The gunmen disappeared after the incident and cops are still hunting for them. Meanwhile, five people were injured in a shoot-out in Nyanga Junction in the early hours of Monday morning.
