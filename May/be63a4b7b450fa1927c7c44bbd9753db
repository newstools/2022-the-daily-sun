LUCAS “Rhoo” Radebe has thrown his weight behind an initiative to create job opportunities for squatter camp residents. The former Bafana Bafana captain and Leeds United player said as someone who grew up in humble circumstances, he didn’t hesitate to accept an invitation to visit Shaun Unterslak’s bakery at Marikana squatter camp in Tshwane on Monday, 23 May. Shaun has been giving unemployed people an opportunity to make money by having them resell bread his bakery makes. Lucas said: “I am here to encourage residents to support the resellers so that they can grow their businesses.” Speaking to the SunTeam, Shaun said he and his brother started creating job opportunities for unemployed people in 1985. “This time, we looked at bread as a way of helping people through these difficult times. “We give people the opportunity to earn money for themselves and grow from there.” Shaun said the bakery was first started in the rural mining community of Refilwe in Tshwane. “Now we’re in Marikana and we want residents to have access to quality bread without having to walk a long distance,” he said. “We need to create hope and opportunities for our fellow South Africans. so we can build a country we can all be proud of. I am working in impoverished communities where residents have lost hope. “Lucas represents a dream that came true and shows we should not lose hope,” said Shaun. Prince George Mahlangu of the Ndzundza Sokhulumi Royal House was also present. He said he wanted to introduce the project to rural communities. Pertunia Mnguni, who will be mentoring residents to grow their businesses, said she was looking forward to seeing people make a difference in their lives. Resident Zakhele Shongwe said he already started selling fresh bread and he liked how fresh it was. He said the shops were too far away and to residents and he was able to support his family.
