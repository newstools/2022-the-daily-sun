AN eThekwini ward councillor has been arrested in connection with the murders of ANC candidate, Siyabonga Mkhize, and community leader Mzukisi Nyanga. Mkhize, who was a Ward 101 candidate, was killed while campaigning door-to-door in Cato Manor, Durban in October. He was in the company of Nyanga when he was murdered. The eThekwini region has welcomed the arrest, but understand the fact that the person is innocent until proven guilty. The eThekwini region spokesman, Mlondi Mkhize, said they stand with the families of the fallen comrades and want justice. “Our freedom is threatened each time a member of the community is murdered or robbed. “It is for these reasons that we implore law enforcement agencies to be firm and act decisively to continue to root out rogue elements that are behind the killing of leaders and innocent members of society,” said Mkhize. He said members of the community must work with the police and isolate criminals. Mkhize added that they will be watching this case closely until its final stage. “We wish to assure the community affected by the absence of the councillor, who is currently in custody, that the ANC will deploy a PR Councillor to service the community,” he said. Mkhize said when the people of eThekwini went to the polls, they voted for services such as water, electricity, housing, roads and job opportunities. He vowed that the ANC will never let them down. “Finally, we further call on all ANC volunteers to continue to mobilise communities to stand up against any form of crime. “We must intensify the fight against crime in all its manifestations from the unacceptable level of murders, assaults, robberies, highjacking to domestic violence. The culture of impunity should not be tolerated in this region,” said Mkhize.
