MEMBERS of Lebidi Stokvel in Tshwane are spitting fire after one of their own allegedly defrauded them with false claims. The members accused the woman from Lotus Gardens, Tshwane, of using fake death certificates to make claims from their stokvel. They alleged she gave them a death certificate on 26 April allegedly belonging to her mother-in-law and she received groceries worth over R16 000. They said she made another claim on 18 May using a death certificate of her uncle and again she received groceries worth nearly R16 000 Stokvel member Pricillar Tselapedi said after the claims were finalised, one of their members asked if they believed the death certificates were legitimate. “We immediately went to Home Affairs and were shocked when they told us they were fake, and that the people were alive.” Pricillar said they demanded that the woman give back all the groceries she got from them. “She didn’t even deny scamming us. Instead, she told us she’ll only return the groceries to the members she contributed to since the year began,” she said. Daily Sun managed to reach the woman, who said she was meeting the police and the stokvel members and they’ll agree on something. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a fraud case was opened against the woman, but no arrest has been made.
