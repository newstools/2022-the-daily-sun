Pitso Mosimane and his  Al Ahly side have missed out on a chance to make history. They succumbed to a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Wydad Casablanca in the final of the 2021-22 CAF Champions League at the Stade Mohamed V on Monday night. A brace from Zouheir El Moutaraji saw the Moroccan giants walk away victors, upsetting Mosimane's Red Devils. Mosimane was hoping to equal Manuel Jose’s record of four Champions League titles as a coach but the Red Castle had other ideas. Ahly, meanwhile, missed out on the chance to become the first club to win the competition three times in succession. It would have been a record extending 11th title for Mosimane's Ahly.
