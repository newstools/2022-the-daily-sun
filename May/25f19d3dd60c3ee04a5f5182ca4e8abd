THERE seems to be no end in sight to the war over water in Diepkloof, Soweto. Residents want water to flow freely from their taps but they say City of Joburg’s Operation Gcina’manzi wants to restrict them by controlling the flow of water. The residents are now up in arms against the contractors who are installing prepaid water meters in their yards. The war turned so nasty that one community leader allegedly received death threats from some contractors after he was accused of influencing the residents to refuse the meters. The site where these contractors put their material went up in flames on Thursday, 26 May, but it’s not clear what caused the fire. Community leader Pitso Monyela said he was approached by some people overseeing the installation of prepaid meters in their kasi. “They accused me of influencing the residents against the installation of prepaid meters and one of them told me he was not afraid of me,” he said. Pitso said the man continued to tell him that he must watch his back. “I took this as intimidation and reported it to the police, but I was told to apply for a protection order against the person who threatened me.” Pitso said the man has since been served with the protection order. “The residents feel the restriction of water metres is going to stop the spirit of ubuntu. People feel they won’t be able to help each other with water should there be a fire or funeral,” he said. Joburg Water spokeswoman Seipati Nyawuza said the residents were consulted before the prepaid meters were installed. “We can’t enter a yard without permission,” she said.
