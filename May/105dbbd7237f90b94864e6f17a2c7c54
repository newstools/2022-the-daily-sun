FORMER Nelspruit Post Office teller Thandeka Dibakwane (43) and Smangele Nyathi (42) were released on R20 000 bail each by the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court on Friday, 27 May. The two were arrested by the Hawks Nelspruit based Serious Corruption Investigation on Tuesday, 24 May for fraud, theft and conspiracy to commit fraud. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said: “In April 2021, a group of four females including Shatale Post Office branch manager, re-issued Sassa social grant cards by circumventing the system. The manager allegedly colluded with the post office tellers who would delay the issuing of the original cards to the lawful owners and give the cards to the runner who is a private person. Nyathi would then visit different ATMs and withdraw money, which they all shared, resulting in the state being defrauded about R17 500. “An internal investigation was conducted and the matter was reported to the Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation. Further investigation led to the issuing of warrants of arrest,” she said. Provincial Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Major General Zodwa Mokoena applauded the team for swift arrests. “As the Hawks, we shall leave no stone unturned. The public is urged to constantly make follow-ups after applying for social grants,” she said. The matter was postponed until 21 July for the arrest of the other remaining suspects, and investigations continue.
