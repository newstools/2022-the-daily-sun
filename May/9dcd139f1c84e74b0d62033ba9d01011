A YOUNG Eastern Cape businessman was gunned down in cold blood in front of his business premises on Monday, 23 May. Ulundi Mpulu (23) is the owner of The Pallet Doctor restaurant in Motherwell, Nelson Mandela Bay. He was shot and killed execution-style while driving in a car with Siyabulela Olayi (29). Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge confirmed that Gqeberha police are investigating a double-murder following a shooting in Motherwell on Monday night. “We can confirm that Mpulu and Olayi were shot in a hail of bullets after the vehicle they were travelling in came under fire on Tyityaba Street in Motherwell. They were approached from behind. Olayi lost control of his car and collided with a container on the side of the road. The suspects continued shooting before speeding away. Olayi sustained several gunshot wounds to his upper body and legs and died as he was rushed to the hospital. Mpulu succumbed to a gunshot wound to the chest shortly after arriving at a nearby hospital.” The statement from his popular eatery, which closed its doors after the incident, reads: “To our valued customers, family, and friends, it is with sadness to announce that our son, brother and the owner of The Pallet Doctor has passed on. Let us all share our tears and mourn with the family for this critical situation we are facing.” ANC Eastern Cape spokesman Gift Ngqondi said: “Ulundi, as a young entrepreneur, was an inspiration to many young people. Receiving the tragic news of his passing shocked me. How can brazen criminals kill this young, vibrant and innovative entrepreneur who was an embodiment of success in the township of Motherwell, a torch-bearer of the township economy? A model of black excellence. Champion of the hospitality industry in Motherwell. What a loss of a great young compatriot who had a bright future.”
