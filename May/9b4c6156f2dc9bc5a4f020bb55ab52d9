ADVOCATE Malesela Teffo told the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane yesterday, 31 May, that two cases relating to the murder of Senzo Meyiwa had been opened. Teffo was continuing with his cross-examination of state witness Sergeant Thabo Mosia, the first forensic officer to arrive at the scene where Meyiwa was shot. At first, Mosia insisted the crime scene was not contaminated but he admitted under cross-examination it was compromised as there was a four-hour delay in attending to it. It was also revealed that the gun used to kill Meyiwa was a revolver and not the model allegedly found on the five accused. Muzikawukhulelwa Sibiya (34), Bongani Ntanzi (30), Mthobisi Mncube (36), Mthokoziseni Maphisa (35) and Sifisokuhle Ntuli (34) are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, illegal possession of a firearm and the illegal possession of ammunition. They have pleaded not guilty. According to Teffo, the people who were in the house, Kelly Khumalo, Zandile Khumalo, Gladness Khumalo, Tumelo Madlala, Mthokozisi Twala, Maggie Phiri and Longwe Twala, should be prosecuted. Reading from the docket of one of the murder cases opened, Teffo said someone in the house shot Meyiwa by accident. Mosia said he couldn’t comment on anything relating to the investigation. “I can only comment on what I did on the crime scene,” he said.
