FIVE men arrested for fraud and corruption, including a Home Affairs official, are scheduled to appear in the White River Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 25 May, for formal bail applications. The five men were arrested by the Hawks on Thursday, 19 May, in Eldorado Park, outside Joburg, and White River in Mpumalanga for fraud, corruption and contravention of the Immigration Act. According to Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, on 13 October 2021, the official schemed with an alleged kingpin from Pakistan who recruited South African citizens to offer their personal details in order for foreigners to get South African passports. This was done in exchange for payment. “South African citizens would use their particulars and fingerprints to apply for the said passports but when it came to the capturing of the photos, foreign nationals would be the ones captured. “This was reportedly facilitated by Home Affairs officials after hours. The South African citizens were allegedly paid R500 each for the utilisation of their particulars by the foreign nationals,” Sekgotodi said. More arrests are expected as the investigation continues.
