SINGER and actor Mthokozisi Ndaba is allegedly hunting for a job. The 2017 Idols SA runner-up is said to have lost his job at a Durban company, where he worked as a truck driver. Ndaba allegedly decided to look for a job after his music career didn’t do well. His close friend alleged that although Ndaba needed work, he could only do light duties due to his operation. “Ndaba was injured last year and he had a back operation. This caused a problem as he struggles to lift heavy things. In the job he just lost, he was required to lift heavy boxes out of the truck. This was difficult for him, that’s why he didn’t last long,” claimed the friend. Ndaba recently revealed his music was not going well and that he felt neglected by the industry.

Ndaba confirmed that he had an operation, but refused to reveal the cause of it. “I lost the job but it was because of my busy schedule. I’m currently promoting my song and I see that it’s doing well. I don’t want to comment further than this,” he said.
