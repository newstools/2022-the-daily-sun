THE way people conduct their businesses in this digital age has significantly changed. One billion people reportedly carry out their businesses each week on Whats­App, Messenger and Instagram Direct. As a result the CEO of Meta platforms, Mark Zuckerberg, has announced that they will be opening up the new cloud-based version of the WhatsApp Business Platform, hosted by Meta, to any business in the world. Speaking at Meta’s Conversations event last Thursday, Zuckerberg said this new integration will provide free and secure cloud hosting services so that businesses can increase their response time for their customers. “So now, whether a business wants to work with one of our 100+ partners or access our service directly, it will be much faster to get up and running on WhatsApp,” Zuckerberg said during the launch. WhatsApp also announced it was working on advanced features for Whats­App Business which will come at a fee in the form of a subscription. The exciting part about these new features is they will allow business owners to manage chats on up to 10 devices so they can handle any load of messages. “We’ll also provide new customisable WhatsApp click-to-chat links to help businesses attract customers across their online presence,” WhatsApp said. It is not clear how much these premium services will cost and when new features will be rolled out. If you run commercial activities which require you to always be in touch with your clients, I suggest you get yourself a Whats­App business account.
