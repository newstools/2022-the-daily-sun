RESIDENTS of Block 6 squatter camp in Browns Farm, Cape Town, are terrified after they found a foetus in a mobile toilet on Thursday, 19 May. Community leader Nosakhele Zenzile said she was called by cleaners to the toilet after they found the foetus. “I then found out that the toilet is used by four families. The key to the toilet was broken, so it was a bit tricky to suspect that the person who did this was from one of these families,” she said. Though the community reported the matter to cops, Zenzile said they continued to do their own investigations. She said they walked door-to-door together with other community leaders to check the breasts of young girls they suspected. “We asked for permission from their parents to examine them. “We then managed to find out who did it. The girl’s clothes were wet on the breast area and we realised she had some breast milk coming out,” said Zenzile. They interrogated the young woman, who told them she aborted the pregnancy because the father denied responsibility and she feared she would not be able to take care of the child. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed they had arrested a woman from Block 6. “General workers found the body of an unborn baby on Thursday, 19 May in Block 6 informal settlement in Browns Farm, Philippi. A woman has since been arrested and detained on a charge of concealment of birth,” said Swartbooi.
