MAMELODI Sundowns have brought the curtain down on the 2021-22 season in style, completing a unique domestic treble by winning the Nedbank Cup. The Tshwane giants defeated Marumo Gallants 2-1 after extra time following a 1-1 draw in regulation time in the final played at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday. Downs’ treble was unique in the sense that they won every trophy available on the domestic front this season, claiming their fifth straight DStv Premiership, the elusive MTN 8 and the Ke Yona Cup. But they were made to sweat hard for Ke Yona Cup by a dogged Gallants outfit who looked determined to upset the apple cart by slaying another giant on their way to defending their title. However, it wasn’t to be as a late Thapelo Morena goal deep in extra time shattered their hearts. Downs, determined to finish their campaign with yet another piece of silverware, started the stronger of the two teams as they pushed for an early goal in the final. Their South American playmaker, Gaston Sirino, was at the centre of everything good they did with the diminutive Uruguayan proving a thorn on the side of Gallants. And he had the ball in the back of the net in the first half, however, the goal was disallowed due to an infringement in the build-up. But it wasn’t long before Downs were knocking on the door again and this time, they were duly rewarded three minutes after the half-hour mark when Peter Shalulile pounced onto a loose ball and slotted into the far corner. Bahlabane Ba Ntwa, as Gallants are affectionately known, had no intention of rolling over for Downs and they took the fight back to the Brazilians in the second half. It was super-sub Sede Junior Deon who came off the bench to score the equalizer for the Limpopo side in the 75th minute, sending the match into extra time. And just when it seemed like the match would be decided by the lottery of the penalty shootout, up stepped Morena who ghosted into the area to slot in the winner.
