WILD Coast communities will march to the High Court in Gqeberha ahead of their case against Shell on Monday, 30 May. The communities and civil societies want the court to review and set aside the decision of the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to grant Shell the exploration right. The Makhanda High Court granted an interim interdict, temporarily blocking Shell’s planned seismic survey in December. A full bench (three judges) will hear arguments from Monday, 30 May to Wednesday, 1 June in the application to review and set aside the decision by the department to award a seismic exploration right to Shell. Amadiba Crisis Committee member Nonhle Mbuthuma said the fossil fuel expansion must stop. “It’s about the threat to marine life from seismic blasting. It’s about the threat to the livelihoods of fishing communities and the rights, including spiritual rights,” she said. Nonhle said another issue they raised in their court papers was that not all affected communities were properly consulted and that the study would have a massive impact on marine life. But Shell has argued that it had consulted widely with all affected communities along the coastline. Nonhle said some 300 villagers on the Amadiba coast, including izangoma, traditional healers and Christians gathered at Mnyameni River Mouth on Saturday 28 May, to pray to God and asked ancestors to help them protect the ocean and their fishing.
