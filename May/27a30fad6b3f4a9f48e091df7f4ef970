BAROKA FC players have admitted they failed their supporters and the club chairman, Khurishi Mphahlele. Bakgaga Ba Mphahlele were relegated to the GladAfrica Championship after finishing the 2021-22 DStv Premiership season at the bottom of the table. Baroka needed victory in the final fixture at Harry Gwala Stadium against Maritzburg United last Saturday to stand any chance of avoiding automatic relegation. “It’s difficult to accept what has happened, the boys are devastated,” said goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze, who confirmed that he will not be leaving the club. “We tried our best but that was not enough. Now we have to dust ourselves and focus, try to bounce back next season.” The keeper said the message was clear from the chairman at the beginning of the season, which was to save the team from being relegated. “We failed our supporters and the chairman,” Chipezeze added. “But now we’ll have to fight next season to bring the team back to the Premiership.” Midfielder Mfanafuthi Shozi said there were a lot of lessons that came with the heartbreak. Shozi said: “We are not okay. But at this stage, there’s no point in crying now. There were a lot of lessons which I believe will help us come back. We will need to work hard. We’d like to apologies to our fans as we disappointed them.” Baroka joins another Limpopo side Black Leopards, who were relegated last season to the GladAfrica Championship. Baroka were promoted to the Premiership in 2016. Their relegation ended six years in the elite league.
