SIBLINGS Siphokuhle (4) and Siyamthanda Nxumalo (2) perished
in a shack fire in Orange Farm, South of Joburg. Their eldest brother Nkosinathi Nxumalo (7) was lucky to
have survived the blaze after he was rescued by neighbours from a blaze which
started on Monday night, 23 May shortly after the area was plunged into
darkness due to load shedding. The mother of the children, Khanyisile Nxumalo (24) had
apparently stepped out to the shops to go and buy candles, leaving the children
in the shack with an almost finished candle. Upon her return, the shack was ablaze and couldn't get
inside to save Siphokuhle and Siyamthana who were sleeping at the time started. The children's uncle Cameroon Nxumalo told Daily Sun,
"My sister was going to the shop and before she could get there the place
was on fire." He said that their family is devastated by the news. "What happened is really bad and very stressful and we
don't even know where to start because there is no one who's working in the
family." Neighbour Refilwe Lichaba (29) said Nkosinathi who is in
hospital was severely burnt on his hands and one leg. "We haven't heard how he's doing in hospital." She said the youngest was burnt beyond recognition "What happened is really painful and at the same time
it is confusing me." She said the mother of the children is blaming herself and
said that if she didn't go to the shops, none of this would have happened. Lichaba described the deceased children as happy and playful
children. She said the young one didn't talk a lot but on Monday she was very
vocal. Joburg EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said: "The
cause of the fire incident is believed to be a lit candle which was left
unattended while in use, the mother of the 3 children survived the incident
unharmed as she is believed to have went to the nearby shops to buy more
candles as the was no electricity in the area when the fire incident
happened."
