AFRICAN National Congress (ANC) branch secretary Bulelani Yosana is expected to appear in court soon for allegedly murdering a teacher and former youth league executive member. Yosana from Kraaifontein in Cape Town and his co-accused made their first appearance in the Blue Downs Magistrates Court on Friday, 27 May and are expected to apply for bail on Wednesday, 1 June. The teacher, Vuyo Duna, was killed in his driveway in February. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said two suspects, aged 32 and 37, were arrested. “The case is being investigated by provincial detectives,” he said. Duna, a former ANC Youth League leader, was a Xhosa teacher in Bloekombos at the time of his murder. ANC Western Cape spokesman Sifiso Mtsweni confirmed the arrests. “The branch has confirmed knowledge of the branch secretary being arrested. “A formal report has been requested from the branch to submit to the organisation. Much clarity is likely to come out of the 1 June appearance,” said Mtsweni. He said the ANC noted the serious allegations against Yosana and would follow court proceedings closely. “Once we have received a full indictment from the courts and NPA, the member will be subjected to internal processes of the organisation, including the rules pertaining to members being charged for serious crimes in a court of law,” said Mtsweni.
