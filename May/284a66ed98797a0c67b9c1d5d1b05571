TAXI ranks are usually associated with violence but Ekasi Fashion Week wanted to change this. The fashion show was held at Duduza Taxi Rank on Sunday, 29 May. Organiser Siyabonga Madonsela (21) from KwaThema, who previously appeared in Daily Sun with his hobo look, said he wanted to show that taxi ranks could also be peaceful. He said he came up with the idea in March, but had a hard time convincing the taxi drivers to back it. “They were divided. Some were happy with the idea and some couldn’t understand it, but they eventually agreed,” he said. Siyabonga said he wants his brand to grow and become internationally known. He said he would love to dress a local celebrity to get exposure. Speaking on behalf of taxi drivers, Phumlane Ndebele said he was very proud of what Siyabonga did. He said it brought light and love to the taxi rank and would help kids stay away from bad habits like drugs. “We will definitely allow him to host this again if he it’s one of his plans, which we hope it is,” he said. Resident Martha Zwane (43) said her daughter had been telling her about the fashion show and she had to see it. She said she loved everything she saw and prayed that the designers do well.
