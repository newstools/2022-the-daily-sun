THE National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa’s (Numsa) fight to better the lives of workers has paid off. This comes after the union signed an above-inflation increase for all workers at ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA). Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said their members have been on strike at all plants nationally since 11 May, demanding higher wages and improved conditions. “We met with the executives of the company to negotiate an end to the strike and our members accepted it,” he said. The agreement includes a 6,5% increase across the board. “The increase means that allowances will also increase by 6,5%. This means the acting allowance, housing allowance, retention allowance, compulsory overtime allowance, pension allowance, shift allowance, standby allowance and Proto Team allowance will also increase,” said Jim. He said the workers will also receive an ex-gratia once-off cash payment of R5000. The one-year agreement comes into effect from 1 April and it expires on 31 March 2023. The increase will be backdated to 1 April and will be payable on the normal pay date for the month of June. Allowances will also be backdated and paid in June. “This agreement is a victory for all Numsa members who made the ultimate sacrifice to fight for improved wages and conditions. They did not do this only for themselves but also for future generations of workers as well. To achieve an above-inflation increase during the Covid-19 pandemic is a major achievement and it would not have been possible without them. We also wish to thank Numsa officials for working extremely hard to secure this deal on behalf of employees,” said Jim.
