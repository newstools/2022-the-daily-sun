PERMISSION Mabilane wants the cops to release her daughter’s alleged killers. The devastated mum of Bontle Mashiyane said: “Release them so I can deal with them.” The six-year-old’s body was discovered on Saturday 21 May not far from her home in Mganduzweni, outside White River in Mpumalanga. Some of her body parts were missing. She was reported missing on 30 April. She was last seen playing with other children near her house. The three suspects, aged 25, 36 and 40, made a brief appearance in the Kabokweni Magistrates Court on Monday 23 May. They are facing charges of rape, murder and kidnapping. They have abandoned their bail application. The media was denied permission to film or record the court proceedings. Prosecutor Martin Britz argued that allowing the media to take pictures of the suspects would put their lives and homes at risk. Permission told Daily Sun: “I want them dead. They caused me too much pain. My daughter was killed like a chicken. “Some of the suspects are known to us. They are our neighbours.” Family member Nokuthula Mazibane (40) said no jail term would bring closure. “I don’t want to see them. They don’t deserve to be part of the community. They did a good thing to abandon bail because if they applied for bail, we were going to eat them alive,” she said. Mpumalanga community safety MEC Vusi Shongwe attended the court proceedings. The matter was postponed to 24 June for further investigation.
