WHY is a private entity being paid R11 million a year to provide accommodation for deaf pupils instead of building them facilities in a boarding school? This is the question asked by DA spokeswoman, Jane Sithole, who claims the Mpumalanga Department of Education is paying a private service provider to accommodate the 179 deaf pupils. She said the department appointed the service provider in 2017 to offer temporary boarding facilities to these pupils. “The department relocated these pupils to the premises of the Bukhosibetfu Full-Service School in Nkomazi near Malelane from unsuitable facilities in Limpopo,” she said. She said the DA was in possession of an internal memorandum from 16 July 2021, where the director for inclusive education, Phililwe Mbatha, requested departmental head Lucy Moyane to facilitate a year-to-year contract until a new school was built. “This is yet another deviation from procurement processes,” she said “The construction of the school for the deaf in Mpumalanga was halted in 2011 when the first announcement was made.” Sithole said they also referred the matter to the office of the public protector. who confirmed an investigation is underway. Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said: “The school in Nkomazi was identified by the department to be one of the only schools with the capacity to accommodate 176 deaf pupils. who at the time had be relocated from Yingisani Special School in Limpopo Province.” He said the department secure accommodation for the pupils at the user friendly and accessible school. “The cost is inclusive of food, accommodation and laundry for 176 pupils and care givers,” he said. He said the department was accelerating efforts to construct a fully- fledged school. for deaf and blind pupils at Emalahleni Local Municipality. “A site has been identified and planning and design are underway.”
