AN emotional night vigil was held at Khanya-Lesedi Secondary School in Ratanda on Monday, 30 May. The ceremony aimed to remember the three brothers who were poisoned, allegedly by their father after giving them a poison-infused energy drink. The father, who is under police guard in hospital, has since asked for forgiveness. Pupils, teachers, residents and officials from the Gauteng Education Department gathered at the school to remember the dead on song and prayers. Grandfather Sehoko Khoabane thanked residents for keeping them in their prayers. The incident, which took place last Thursday, left residents of Ratanda in Heidelberg shocked. The 40-year-old dad, who was working as an electrician, called his five kids to give them the energy drink after their mum had left for work. But his fourth son refused to drink it. When they got to school, the four kids who consumed the drink started getting sick. They complained of stomach pains, and their teachers called an ambulance. Sadly, the two pupils at Khanya-Lesedi died before the ambulance could arrive. Katleho (13) and Lehlohonolo (16) died in the school’s sick room. A few minutes later, Tebogo (6), who was at Ratanda Primary School, also died. Grief-stricken mum Ntswaki (35) said her other son was still recovering in hospital. “My husband was a very quiet person, and I still don’t understand what pushed him to do this.” Their memorial service will be held on Wednesday, 1 June and the funeral is on Saturday, 4 June.
