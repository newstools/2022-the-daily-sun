RESIDENTS and family members of the slain tavern patron from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, say they’re excited that justice will finally prevail. This follows the arrest of an Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department (EMPD) officer suspected to be behind the shooting of six people at Putlane Tavern in Katlehong two weeks ago. According to the victim’s brother Themba Zwane, the family wants justice to be served. He said although the cops have not come to their home to officially inform them, they’re relieved that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Themba said his brother Sibusiso (29) was buried over the weekend after two weeks of investigation by the police. On the day that Sibusiso was killed, he was allegedly involved in an argument, which led to a fight with the suspect and his friends. Residents told Daily Sun that after the fight, the suspect was allegedly going around his kasi vowing that Sibusiso was not going to see the weekend. Sibusiso was shot on Friday, 8 July, together with his two friends and other patrons.
