PRINCE Gulukhulu Mathebula has called on women to look dignified when they walk. The Contralesa chairman for the Vhembe District, Limpopo, said traditionally, it showed respect as men were attracted to the way women walked and talked. “As Contralesa, we are saying let’s go back to our roots. We are lost. “If we don’t go back to our roots, it means we are doing something which is foreign to us. “This is misleading our new generation,” he said. Mathebula said a nation which does not know where it’s going and where it stands is lost. He said women must wear dignified clothes and should stop wearing miniskirts as they struggle to bend down, and are exposing their bodies. “These rights given to young people make them die earlier because they are not following their roots,” he said. Mathebula also cautioned Tsonga women, who he said were abusing the xibelani. “Once you wear xibelani, that represents the culture of Tsonga people and one cannot just walk anyhow,” he said. “They should stop dancing anyhow with these regalia.” He said that those who wanted to wear cultural regalia should be taught by the right people, especially elders, on how to wear cultural clothes and how to present themselves in them. He said western and African culture couldn’t be mixed all the time and people should go back to their roots. “People must understand that when one is practising culture that is not being evil as these are our roots,” he said. “People should stop demonising those practising their African culture.”
