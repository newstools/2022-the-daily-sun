VANDALISM has led Eskom to shut down a Seboka substation in
the Vaal, south of Joburg on Saturday, 23 July 2022. Gauteng Eskom Spokesman, Amanda Qithi, said, “The shutdown
was implemented to protect the transformer from further damage or catching fire
which could result in an explosion. “The substation control room was vandalised, panel wiring
and protection cables were cut creating a major risk to the transformer as its
protection was compromised, leaving the power utility with no choice but to
shut down the substation.” Qithi said the shutdown of the Seboka substation has
affected the electricity supply to Evaton, Evaton Small Farms, and Sebokeng
Zones 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 13. READ: ESKOM SUBSTATION ON FIRE! “Technicians are currently conducting further assessments to
determine the extent of the damages and the equipment required for repairs to
estimate when supply can be restored to the affected areas. “Eskom apologises for the inconvenience caused as it works
on repairing the substation and restoring supply to the affected customers.
Members of the public are encouraged to report illegal electricity-related
activities to the law enforcement agencies or Eskom,” Qithi said.
