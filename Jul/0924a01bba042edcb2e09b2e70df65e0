WHEN her marriage seemed to be falling apart, she decided to use korobela on her husband. And her marriage improved drastically. But the spark didn’t last long and the 48-year-old woman now wants the korobela to stop. She said the korobela has now turned her man into an obsessive and toxic person. The husband apparently quit his job, dumped his friends and follows the woman around. Speaking to Daily Sun, the woman from Braamfischer in Soweto said: “We dated for three years before we got married in 2005. I was attracted to him because of his great personality and he was hard working. “He enjoyed going out with friends and that became a problem because he was no longer spending time with me. When I found out that he was having an affair, we fought a lot.” The woman said she followed the korobela instructions and mixed it with his food. She said he started spending more time with her but four years ago, she decided to stop because he was becoming too needy. “He even buys me sanitary pads, washes my panties and irons my clothes for work,” she said. The woman said she had consulted three izangoma for help, but their methods didn’t work. Sangoma Nzama Maluleke said korobela could never be completely be removed. “She can get help but she must know that her husband will never go back to his normal self,” he said. “The reason her husband’s behaviour is getting worse is because the roots of the muthi used for the korobela keep growing inside of him.”
