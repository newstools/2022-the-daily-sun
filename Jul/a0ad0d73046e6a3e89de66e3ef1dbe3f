INANDA cops in KZN have arrested a 25-year-old woman for allegedly killing her baby in Amaoti on Tuesday, 26 July. Police spokeswoman Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said the woman was allegedly pregnant and when she was found without a baby, the neighbours became suspicious and questioned her. Ngcobo said the woman told her neighbours that the child had died. “On arrival at the scene at about 2pm, police established that the community had forced the woman to dig up the shallow grave where the remains of her baby were buried,” Ngcobo said in a statement. She said the woman was arrested and detained at Inanda Police Station. “She was charged with birth concealment, while the body of the baby was transported to a local mortuary.” The woman will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court on Thursday, 28 July.
