THE ANC is
not looking into adopting new policies but rather strengthening, implementing
and correcting the existing ones. This was by
the treasurer general Paul Mashatile on the second day of the policy which is
underway at Nasrec outside Joburg on Saturday 30. Mashatile
told journalists on an update briefing at the conference centre that delegates
were down in discussions around policy issues. The
treasurer general said the policy conference in its nature was about refining
policies and implementing those policies. Mashatile
said delegates were raising concerns about some policies that had not been
implemented and wanted to know the reasons why they had not been implemented. He also
confirmed that delegates had been discussing the contentious step aside rule
but they had been warned not to spend too much time on the rule as many other
issues affecting the masses. Mashatile
also said the discussion around President Cyril Ramaphosa's scandal on the
Phala Phala robbery had been stifled as the matter still had to go to the
Integrity Commission. READ: Ramaphosa: ANC is at its weakest point! Ahead of
the conference reports emerged that Ramaphosa had appeared before the commission
but refused to answer questions about his role, resulting in the meeting
collapsing. Mashatile
also said delegates had been discussing the state of the party taking it from
Ramaphosa's admission that the party was at its weakest. Expanding
on Ramaphosa's explanation of what led to the weakness of the party, Mashatile
said this was caused by the flood of members who had joined the party for their
ulterior motives. The
conference is expected to go on deep into the night where there are expected
reports back from the commission. Mashatile
said the conference would go on until midnight.
