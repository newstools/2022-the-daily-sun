A UNIVERSITY of the Free State student, who was report missing from Saturday, 4 June, has been found alive. Kwandiswa Xaba (18) from Ladysmith, KZN, was last seen by her roommate on the day at their residential accommodation. And the police, as well as her parents, found her in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni after disappearing for more than a month. A family member said: “We are only grateful and happy that we found our daughter alive. Anything else we will address as a family. “But we welcome the assistance and appreciate everyone’s involvement in helping us find her alive,” he said. He added that the teenager was still traumatised, but declined to give full details.  SRC deputy president Trinity Mthembu said the parents and student were happy. “However, the family did say she’s in a traumatic state. We appreciate interventions for her to recover and be the vibrant young girl we know,” said Mthembu. Captain Phumelelo Dlamini said police followed leads from her friends, leading to Crescent Mall in Phuthaditjhaba. “The CCTV footage obtained from the mall showed her getting inside a taxi that goes to Standerton in Mpumalanga. She was then traced through cellphone towers. The investigator was also assisted by taxi drivers and commuters with information about where she was last seen. Her new boyfriend saw her photos on social media and that she was reported missing. He then called the investigating officer and told him that he was with her in Tembisa,” added Dlamini. On Sunday, 17 July, the police and her parents went to Tembisa and found her unharmed. They then brought her back home.
