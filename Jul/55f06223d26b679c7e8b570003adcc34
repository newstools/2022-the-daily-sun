POLICE have denied allegations that Prince Dlamini  from Tsakane in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, was arrested  on Friday afternoon, 8 July, for impersonating a lawyer. Police said the information is fake and it is not from them. It was circulated on social media that Dlamini operated as a lawyer in courts around Tshwane, including Mamelodi. It was also alleged that he represented over 100 people  in a period of two years and won 63 of those cases.  “Now each and every person he represented has to go back on trial,” the social media claims said. Gauteng police spokeswoman, Colonel Dimakatso Sello, said: “That information was circulated in a fake social media page of the station and there is no truth to it.” Sello also said this is not an official South African Police Service Facebook page and the station has no record of that incident.
