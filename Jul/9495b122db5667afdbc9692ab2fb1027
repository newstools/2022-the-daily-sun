THE BRUTAL attack on Tshepo Lebudi three years ago has left him suffering nightmares to this day. He was allegedly kidnapped, drugged, tied up with cables and assaulted without mercy. AND THEN THEY CUT OFF HIS THUMBS AND PUT THEM IN A LUNCH BOX! “I tried to scream but they stuffed my mouth with things so I could not be heard. I thought I was going to die when I heard them saying they also want my 4-5,” said the 26-year-old from Selosetsha section at Majaneng in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. Tshepo told Daily Sun that he was taken to bushes in Bosplaas by six unknown men. He said in June 2019 at about 6pm, they had stormed into his yard and kidnapped him. They first assaulted him, and kept hitting him with a gun before they cut off both his thumbs. “One suggested they leave me. I pretended to be dead. They continued assaulting me and even poured beer over me,” he said, adding that he was still struggling to sleep. “I can’t sleep properly. During winter, my hands get as cold as ice. I’m unable to do anything and these hands are supposed to feed me. “I ask myself what kind of a job I will get because I cannot even get gardening work. I just want my thumbs back!” he said. He said he was worried as he didn’t know why his thumbs were taken. “Who is using them? What do they want them for? I need help to get past this. I feel as if I have died,” he shared. Tshepo added that he never reported the matter to the police as he felt the thugs were watching him and would finish him off, should they see him going to a police station. President of African Dingaka Organisation Dr Andrew Somo said real healers did not use human body parts for muthi. He said the only parts that could be mixed with muthi to heal were from an animal – and not killed. He urged Tshepo and his family to consult a healer to find out what happened to the thumbs. Counselling psychologist Dr Lerato Mokhethi advised Tshepo to seek professional help as he was dealing with both emotional and physical issues.
