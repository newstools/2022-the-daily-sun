I went to sleep with her at my side and that’s why I woke up – because my daughter wasn’t next to me,” the mum told Telemundo 44. The girl was declared dead at the scene, and her stepfather is in coma after he was critically injured. The Howard County Police Department said the girl was behind the wheel when the family’s Toyota Corolla crashed. “This is particularly unusual because of the girl’s age and also because it was at 2am. So, we have a lot of investigations to do to determine all the details,” said the department.
