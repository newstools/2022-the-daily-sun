AN 11-year-old girl was killed and two others injured on Monday, 25 July, after a train crashed into their bakkie on a farm road crossing in Syferbult between Derby and Magaliesburg. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene at around 3.30pm to find the bakkie smashed against the front of the train. “Community members had already pulled two girls and a man from the bakkie. Medics assessed the patients and found that the 11-year-old girl had already succumbed to her numerous injuries,” Meiring said. He said a 17-year-old girl and a man believed to be in his 40s were found in critical condition. “The patients were treated and provided with advanced life support interventions before they were transported to a nearby hospital for urgent treatment,” Meiring said. He said no one from the train was injured and local authorities were on the scene for further investigation.
