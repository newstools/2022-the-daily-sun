MALEHLOHONOLO Malatjie watched as Simphiwe Mgcina and Mpho Makondo ran home after they had accompanied her to a salon. She stood on top of a rock at the street corner, watching the kids going home and when they were three houses away, thinking they were safe, she went back to the salon to finish doing her hair. Little did she know that she was seeing them alive for the last time. This was according to her testimony as she took to the witness stand at the High Court sitting in Palm Ridge on Tuesday, 26 July, to give her version of events as the last person to see the kids alive. She was testifying in the trial of triple murder-accused Pontsho Mohlanka, who stands accused of being involved in the murders of three children, aged between six and eight.

I assumed they were at Simphiwe’s place if they were not home. But my brother asked me where they were because they were not at Simphiwe’s place,” she said. As it was late at night, they then went to Lerato Makondo’s place, who is Mpho’s mum, but she told them the kids never came home. And that was when a frantic search for the two kids started. It came to a devastating end the following day when the kids were found not far from their homes, dead and naked. The boy was found in the yard of a man called Muzikayise Nkosi while the girl was found at the street corner.
