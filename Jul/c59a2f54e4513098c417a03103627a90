A ONE-YEAR-OLD baby girl is in hospital after being hit by a stray bullet on Saturday, 9 July, at around 12.45pm. She was playing outside her home while a funeral was being held at the nearby cemetery in Pienaar outside Mbombela. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said the little girl’s family lives next to the cemetery in Thekwane North and on the sad day, the little girl was apparently playing outside. “Gunshots were reportedly heard coming from the nearby graveyard where there was a burial and moments later, the child was heard screaming. When her mother rushed outside to find out what was happening to her daughter, she noticed the baby was bleeding on her lower body. “The baby was then taken to a nearby clinic by a private vehicle and the medical staff confirmed she had a gunshot wound on her leg. However, the child had to be swiftly transferred to hospital.” He said police were notified of the incident by their hospital counterparts. “Upon arrival, a case of attempted murder was opened with an immediate launch of a manhunt for the suspect(s). Police at Pienaar have since made a call to members of the public to come forth with information regarding people who fired shots at the funeral by calling CrimeStop at 08600 10111 or to send information via MYSAPSAPP. All received information will be treated as confidential and callers may opt to remain anonymous.” Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has strongly condemned the incident, and more so as an innocent child had to bear the consequences of someone’s careless behaviour. She also lashed out at those who use firearms at burial sites, thinking it is normal and allowed. “South Africa is governed by laws and a situation whereby firearms are misused at funerals, thereby placing the lives of innocent citizens at risk, can never be allowed. “Such perpetrators should be hunted down to come and account,” Manamela said.
