FIVE people were recently arrested in India for allegedly forcing students, at an exam centre, to remove their bras before entering the hall. A 17-year-old teen, who was sitting for her first pre-medical entrance exam, was left traumatised and shared the ordeal with her parents. According to Mirror, the father of the victim registered a case with the police. He said his daughter was dressed as per the dress code mentioned, which did not say anything about underwear.

The father told a local TV channel that shortly after dropping his daughter at the centre, he and his wife got a call asking them to come to the gate. “When we reached the gate, our daughter was in tears. She said she and other girls were being asked to remove part of their underwear. She then asked for a shawl to wear during the test,” he said. It is reported that the mother gave her daughter a shawl, and she went back inside. The publication further reported that once the exam was over, the teen was still distressed and told them what had happened. It was not clear why invigilators forced students to take off their bras. DR R Bindu, the minister of higher education in Kerala, said the conduct was unacceptable. “We will be conveying our disappointment regarding what happened to the centre and national testing agency,” she added.
