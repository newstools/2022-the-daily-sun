A MUM and her daughter are lucky to be alive after their shack was set alight. The trouble started on Friday, 22 July, when the woman got into an argument with her boyfriend, who allegedly threatened her. Fearing for their lives, the two went to sleep at a neighbour’s house and ended up saving their lives. That night, their shack in Meloding in Virginia, Free State, was set on fire, allegedly by the boyfriend. The 28-year-old mum told Daily Sun her boyfriend accused her of cheating and they started arguing. “After the argument, he said he would teach me a lesson. I was afraid to sleep in my shack, so I went to my neighbour’s place. He came in the middle of the night to set my shack alight,” he said. The woman pleads with SunReaders to assist her and her daughter with clothes and food. She said all their belongings went up in flames. Police spokesman Captain Steven Thakeng said a case of arson was opened at Meloding Police Station.
