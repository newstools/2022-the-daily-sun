THE Eastern Cape
police have arrested four suspects for allegedly stealing the belongings of the
21 youngsters who died during the Enyobeni Tavern tragedy in Scenery Park last
month. The suspects are
expected to appear in the East London Magistrates Court on Monday, 25 July. Last week, the
Department of Health and police pointed out methanol as the possible cause of
death in their preliminary report. But the authorities are still looking at the
quantitative results, which were found in the blood samples of the
21 teenagers. Police spokesman
Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said: “The four aged between 16 and 21 were
arrested on Thursday and Friday as part of the ongoing investigation into the
tragedy. The arrests are a sequel to the investigation which started
immediately after the reported deaths of 21 children in the tavern. The
investigation led the police to the arrest of suspects believed to have been
involved in stealing from the deceased lifeless bodies.” READ: Enyobeni tavern horror: Why booze and carbon monoxide are
not causes of death He said the stolen
items recovered included shoes, weaves, clothes and a watch belonging to some
of the children who died during the incident. “The arrested suspects
are not linked to the death of 21 children, as there is no evidence to suggest
their involvement at this stage. The investigation into establishing the cause
of death is still underway. At the right time, the affected families will be
informed,” he said. All four suspects are
expected to appear in the East London Magistrates Court on Monday, 25 July. The
accused are charged for theft, possession of suspected stolen property, and
defeating the ends of justice.”
