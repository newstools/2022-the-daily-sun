FAMILY members of one of the people killed in a tavern shooting in Sweetwaters, Pietermaritzburg, KZN have welcomed the arrest of two suspects. They said they were pleased that cops acted swiftly, and were hoping the suspects would explain why they did it. They were caught on Monday, 11 July, two days after the shooting of 12 people at Samukelisiwe tavern. This was confirmed by Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, adding that the car allegedly used in the crime was also found. Four people died in the incident. Mfanafuthi Dlamini (22), whose brother Nkosinathi Mdladla (32) was also killed, said he was glad the suspects were caught. “Now we will know who killed the victims and why. These suspects must get a harsh sentence for what they did,” he said. Njabulo Mtolo, ANC spokesman in Moses Mabhida, said: “There should be no stone left unturned in efforts to apprehend every perpetrator involved in this barbarous act. “This will contribute to restoring public confidence and trust in our police.” While people were enjoying themselves at the tavern on Saturday night, two men jumped out of a car, entered the tavern and fired random shots at them. A total of 12 people were shot, with two declared dead at the scene and two others in hospital. Suspects then fled the scene. Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened at Plessislaer cop shop.
