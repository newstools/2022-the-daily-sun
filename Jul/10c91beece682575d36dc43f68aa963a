ANC KZN has new leadership led by chairman Siboniso Duma after he toppled Premier Sihle Zikalala to the top provincial position at the party’s elective conference. In what was a clean sweep by the Taliban faction, Nomagugu Simelane was elected deputy chairperson, Bheki Mtolo provincially secretary, Sipho Hlomuka deputy secretary and Dr Ntuthuko Mahlaba treasurer. It marked the end of the reign of Zikalala in what is a blow to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s bid for a second term after the province rejected his allies. The conference continues this morning to elect additional members of the provincial executive committee. READ: Mashatile: Road to unity won’t be easy!
