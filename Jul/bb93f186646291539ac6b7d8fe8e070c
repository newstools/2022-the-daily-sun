COPS said a girl (1) was killed after an eight-year-old boy fired his dad’s gun in a Florida hotel room. The girl’s two-year-old sister was also injured in the horror incident that happened on Saturday, 25 June, at Lion’s Motel near Pensacola. The wounded two-year-old’s twin sister, who was also in the room, is said to be uninjured. The New York Post reported that cops said the boy fired a round that passed through a wall at the motel while playing with the firearm, which he found hanging in a closet when his father left the room.

All three girls belong to Randall’s partner, who was sleeping at the time of the shooting. Randall, his son, his girlfriend, and her three daughters were all sharing the same room. Simmons said Randall returned to the room after the incident, took the weapon and what investigators believe were drugs, and left again before returning to the scene. Randall was arrested following the shooting and has been released on a $41,000 (about R67 000) bail and will appear in court on 15 July. He was charged with two counts of culpable negligence for storing a loaded firearm within reach or easy access of a minor, which was used to inflict injuries on another person, tampering with physical evidence and failing to store or leave a firearm in a required manner.
