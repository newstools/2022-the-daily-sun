MEDIA personality Bonang Matheba has told Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa to find a new job. This after South African women’s soccer team Banyana Banyana won the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon). They played against Morocco and beat them 2-1. Nathi took to social media to congratulate them. He wrote: “It feels good for South African football to, once again, reach the pinnacle of continental football, for the first time since 1996. Indeed, it is coming home Mzansi.” But Bonang quickly dragged the minister and told him to find a new job. “Because NOTHING has been done since 1996! Imagine the nerve!! Swooping in to celebrate a VICTORY you didn’t cultivate!! Find a new job!” ALSO READ: Lasizwe, Mohale’s kiss leaves Mzansi shook! Bonang’s post was widely shared among social media users and people reiterated Bonang’s sentiments. People were also calling for the minister to compensate Banyana. Khanya Thembane wrote: “Minister I suggest that you pay them decent salaries, they are worth all the bells and whistles allocated to the male national team which delivers below par results. Pay them decent salaries! Sponsor them! Give them national team perks, they’ve earned it.” David Mathekga commented: “R400 000 each to our ladies is too little, if it was Bafana you were going to give them tenders and R1.5 million each, so Minister Mathis, do the right thing or else will march to your offices, pay our champs.” Bonang joins a long list of creative practitioners who have been calling for Nathi to go.
