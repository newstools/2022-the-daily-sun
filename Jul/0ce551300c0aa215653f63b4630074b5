CONVICTED ex-cop killer Rosemary Nomia Ndlovu has asked for her case to be postponed for two months. In a brief appearance in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court on Thursday, 7 July, her lawyer Makamu Baloyi said she wanted to make representations to the Deputy Public Protector (DPP). “The representations will be submitted by the end of the week to the DPP office,” she told Magistrate Prince Manyathi. Wearing a white polo neck and a blue skirt with a new hairdo, Rosemary sat chatting with waders who escorted her. She had leg irons on. Prosecutor Riana Williams told the court that the defence and prosecutions have found each other about the allegations that Baloyi was being stalked. “It was a misunderstanding and both parties have been made aware and an apology has been offered,” said Williams. In the previous appearance, the defence lawyers claimed that a complainant in the case made a personal inquiry about one of the lawyers. Baloyi confirmed that the matter was resolved. Rosemary is facing two separate attempted murder charges. In the first case, she’s accused with police officer Nomsa Mudau of attempting to murder Justice Mudau in 2018. Justice and Nomsa were married at the time. In the second matter, she’s charged with conspiracy to murder two police officers, Sergeant Benneth Mabunda and colonel Nthipe Boloka, who were investigating her murder spree. The plot was hatched shortly after she was bust in March 2018. The attempts were made while Rosemary was still working as a cop at the Tembisa Police Station. Both cases were postponed to 15 September for the outcome of representations and for the arrest of Rosemary’s co-accused in the second case. Rosemary is currently serving a life term at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Services after she was handed six life sentences for the murders of six relatives she had killed for insurance payouts. Nomsa is out on warning.
