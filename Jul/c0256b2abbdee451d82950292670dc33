LINDA Motlhalo’s late goal from a penalty spot helped Banyana Banyana beat Cosafa neighbours Zambia 1-0 at Stade Mohamed V in Casablanca on Monday to reach the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final. VAR came to Banyana’s rescue by reversing Ethiopian referee Lidya Tafesse Abebe’s decision not to award a penalty after Jermaine Seoposenwe was fouled by a Zambian defender. Banyana are chasing after their maiden Wafcon trophy having already achieved their first objective of qualifying for next year’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand by reaching the semi-final.  Desiree Ellis side now have bragging rights as they avenged the 3-0 hammering they suffered at the hands of She-polopolo in a friendly played in Zambia in February. They came into the match with their heads held high having maintained a 100 percent record in the tournament that also saw them beat defending champions Nigeria 2-1 in the opening match while they registered a hard fought 1-0 win over Tunisia in the quarterfinals to secure their ticket to the World Cup. Zambia were also unbeaten in the competition having forced their way through to the last four with a win over Senegal on penalties after the teams drew 1-1 at fulltime. They also brushed aside Togo 4-1, Tunisia 1-0 and played a goalless draw against Cameroon in the Group stages. Zambia made their presence felt early on with the backing of their vocal fans relying on counter attacks in a bid to break the strong Banyana defence led by veteran Noko Matlou. She-polopolo almost grabbed the opener in the 10th minute when captain Graced Chanda unleashed a thunderous shot from outside the penalty box forcing keeper Andile Dlamini to make a great save. Banyana got settled as the game progressed playing a short passing game, but they struggled to create scoring chances as they failed to take a single shot on target in the first half. The final will take place on Saturday.
