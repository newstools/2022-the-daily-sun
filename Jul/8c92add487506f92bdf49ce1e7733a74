LEBOGANG accompanied a friend to buy kotas two streets from her home and never returned. Following that, an unknown body of a young woman was found in Evaton on Sunday afternoon, 3 July. The body was identified as Lebogang Mthembu (22) form Lakeside, who was reported missing at Orange Farm Police Station on 13 June. A neighbour saw a post on Facebook about an unknown young woman who was found in an open field in Evaton, Vaal and informed the Mthembu family. Lebogang’s body was found by a passerby at an open field behind Wilberforce Community College on Sunday afternoon, 3 July and her face was burnt beyond recognition. According to Deliwe Mthembu (42), Lebogang went missing on 11 June, three days after she was assaulted by some girls in the kasi because of a Facebook post in which they were mocking each other about who has an ugly baby vs who has a beautiful one. This led to her being assaulted on 9 June. Deliwe told Daily Sun that on the day her daughter disappeared, a friend of Lebogang arrived at their home at about 6pm and asked Lebogang to accompany her to buy a kota and promised that she will also buy one for her. That was the last time Deliwe saw her daughter. Lebohang leaves behind a 22-month-old baby girl. Community members together with the Emfuleni Local Municipality MMC for public safety, Councillor Ndade Mokoena, marched to Wilberforce Community College on Monday morning. Mokoena told the college deputy principal that they were giving the college five days to do something with the land or he will tell his community to erect shacks on the land. Mokoena said that the open field was used as a dumping site for bodies and many types of criminal activities. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said the police opened a murder docket for further investigation and asked anyone with information about the murder to come forward.
