NYAOPE addicts were seen collecting scrap metal and according to residents, they started a fire. Soon, the fire was out of control and spread to nearby shacks. Judas Mbatha from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, was not home when the fire started and was devastated to return home to find his shack, which was closest to the bushes where the nyaope boys were, covered in flames. By that point, there was nothing he could do and the fire ate all his belongings. Judas said all his children’s uniforms went up in flames and he was worried that they would have nothing to wear when schools re-opened after the winter holiday. “We lost everything, furniture, clothes and my kids’ books and uniforms. I’m appealing to the public to please donate uniforms,”he said. Resident Amos Ngwenya said they tried to put out the fire, but it was too strong. “It’s sad that this happened to our neighbour,”he said. Residents said they were concerned about long grass next to their shacks because thugs hid there and sometimes started fires. They said they weren’t able to see what was going on in the grass. Resident Pheello Ndamase said they tried locating the nyaope addicts, but couldn’t see them. An inquest docket was opened at Etwatwa Police Station.
