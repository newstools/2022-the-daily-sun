A WOMAN, only identified as Kayleigh, was serious about having a cousin – even if it meant doing this herself. The mum of three from Alberta, Canada, took to social media and said: “I’m pregnant with my cousin.” Telling the unusual story behind her latest pregnancy, she said after months of fertility treatments, a lot of hormones and needles as well as two embryo transfers, she was now due to give birth to her cousin on 1 September.

The New York Post reports that she was willing to be a gestational carrier (surrogate) for them if they had any interest in going that route. “I love being pregnant, had the world’s easiest pregnancies and after the loss of my first pregnancy in 2016, I had a huge heart for pregnancy loss and infertility struggles,” she said. “It just seemed like what I was supposed to do. The biggest perk besides being able to give them this gift, is being able to freak people out when I say the baby is actually my cousin,” Kayleigh joked.
