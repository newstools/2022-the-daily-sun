A 25-YEAR-OLD man has been arrested for allegedly murdering a pregnant woman. The gruesome incident took place in Ashanti Region in Ghana on 20 June. According to the Mirror, the suspect allegedly murdered the 30-year-old woman and cut the unborn baby from her stomach. It is reported that the horror incident stemmed from a misunderstanding after the woman’s goat had trespassed onto the suspect’s farm and eaten some of his produce. Tepa District Police Commander Superintendent Martin Asenso confirmed the tragic incident to Akoma FM. READ: Case against ‘mum killer’ postponed! He told the station that the suspect had earlier come to lodge a complaint that some farmer’s goats went astray and started eating his produce. “When he confronted them, they chopped his hand with a machete. A few irate youngsters arrived at the police station and claimed that the suspect had actually killed two women, saying their goats had chewed his maize,” Asenso said. The publication also reported that there were allegations that the man had attempted to kill another 17-year-old pregnant girl, but she was able to escape the attack. An angry mob reportedly stormed the station where the suspect was held in an attempt to avenge the slain woman. The suspect has since been transferred to regional police to avoid any attempts from locals to take his life.
