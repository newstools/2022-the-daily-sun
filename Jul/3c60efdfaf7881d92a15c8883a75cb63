A CONGREGANT is fearing for her life after a mamfundisi demanded she leave her kasi. The 36-year-old from Alexandra, Joburg, said she didn’t know what she was accused of. The woman said her mamfundisi told her to leave after she caught her with her husband in his car on 29 June. “I don’t like it when pastors pray for people in public, so I asked for a private prayer,” she said. But the wife was already suspecting that her husband was cheating on her. “The fact that I’m single is one of the things that makes her think I’m dating her husband.” The woman said a week later, the furious wife told her to leave Alexandra. “I have built a beautiful life here and have kids. Why would I listen to an insecure woman telling me to leave?” she asked. The woman said three men came to her home on separate occasions to tell her to leave. “I apologised and stopped going to church, and that should be enough,” she said. The woman said she opened a case of intimidation but she never got a case number. Her sister (45) said she understood why the mamfundisi was angry but she needed to stop threatening her sister. However, the mamfundisi (47) told the SunTeam she was not threatening anyone. She said she only called the woman once and said anything beyond that was not her. “The woman is lying when she says she’s not dating the pastor. I’ve always been suspicious. I saw how they looked at each other during church services and how my husband disappeared whenever she did. “I’m not a child and you know when your husband is cheating,” she said.
