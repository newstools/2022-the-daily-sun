 The DA wants answers on how government plans to slash fuel prices. The party said as Mzansi approaches another fuel price hike this month, Mineral Resources and Energy minister Gwede Mantashe and Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana were silent on the issue. "An out of touch, uncaring and negligent approach by both Mantashe and Godongwana is not surprising from the ANC government that continues to impose sky-high fuel prices on us," said DA Shadow ninister of Mineral Resources and Energy Kevin Mileham. He said the two ministers have refused to even acknowledge "the extremely well-supported petition" submitted by the DA on 14 June to slash fuel prices. "In fact, Mantashe has not even acknowledged receipt of the letter and petition, despite numerous attempts, letters and e-mails to his ministerial office. The office is simply missing in inaction," said Mileham. The Automobile Association warned that the looming fuel price hike could go up to R2 for a litre of 95 octane petrol. The DA called for the scrapping of the General Fuel Levy and the ministers should give exemptions to the RAF Levy through a SARS tax rebate. "This would free up the RAF from claims for those drivers and save those drivers another R2.18 per litre, who would get this back as a tax rebate from SARS," said Mileham. He called on Godongwana and Mantashe to immediately table proposals on reducing the fuel price, and to report back to the country on the status of their interventions to date. "South Africans cannot afford the excessive fuel taxes and the impact rising fuel costs have on food and other product prices," he said.
