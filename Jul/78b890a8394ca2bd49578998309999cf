A HITMAN thought he could escape the long arm of the law by fleeing the areas where he allegedly committed crime, and starting afresh somewhere else. But things did not go according to plan when he was caught while on his way to the Western Cape. He was arrested, and is now behind bars. The 31-year-old man, who is linked to a string of murder cases, was caught on a bus on Thursday, 28 July. KZN police spokeswoman Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said cops acted on information regarding the suspect, who was wanted for cases including murder, attempted murder, carjacking, robbery and kidnapping. Ngcobo said the crimes were committed in Inanda, KwaMashu, Mayville and other areas around Durban. “A roadblock was put in place at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza, south of Durban, with other law enforcement agencies. The suspect was travelling in a bus going to WC,” said Ngcobo. She added that the bus was intercepted and the man was arrested. “He was found in possession of a rifle with 90 rounds of ammunition that were concealed in his luggage bag. The suspect will appear in court soon,” she said.
