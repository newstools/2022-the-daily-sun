A candlelight vigil was held to remember murdered teen Kutlwano Kasibe. On Wednesday evening, 13 July, the community of Molapo gathered at Mgababa Park in Soweto. The community is calling for justice. Councillor Nompumelelo Mazibuko from ward 33, pleaded with the community to never take the law into their own hands. She said Kutlwano's life was cut short in a 'gruesome and unfair' manner.  Mazibuko said:  "Kutlwano died very painfully. He couldn't defend himself even more so, because he had a disability." Nearly two months ago, Mazibuko was nearly attacked by angry community demanding electricity. The community has been without electricity since March.  She said: "From my own experience, I know how terrified Kutlwano might have felt. I was scared too when I almost got attacked by the very same community I'm serving. In his last moments, we are told Kutlwano cried for his mom. The community has turned an abnormal situation into a norm and this has to stop. "Even if Kutlwano had wronged, the community should have called his parents. He didn't have to be assaulted over a tap. A tap could be easily replaced but not his life.  "Now that he is gone, may he find peace and he will never be forgotten. His tragic death shouldn't be in vain and justice must take its course," added Mazibuko. The 16-year-old teen was allegedly tied to a tree and doused with ice water and his wounds sprayed with sanitizers, then sjambokked and shocked with a car battery, by residents of Mapetla last month. Three suspects have since been arrested in connection with his killing and denied bail in Protea Magistrates Court. Kutlwano's aunt, Tozi Kasibe said the family was not coping. "Every day it gets harder. I still wake up in the middle of the night hoping to find him in his room. Not only did I lose my nephew but a best friend too. There was never a dull moment with him, he joked and laughed a lot. His mother hasn't been the same, I don't know how to comfort her anymore, " said Tozi.
