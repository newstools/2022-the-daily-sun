The official was isolated and treated as she was symptomatic,” Mokoka said. “And 48 hours prior to the Botswana game (the final group stage match), we had one player who tested positive for Covid-19 and she was also symptomatic. “She was put in quarantine and treated accordingly. Her asymptomatic roommate who tested negative is in isolation, hence they both missed Botswana game,” the doctor concluded. Banyana need a win against the North African to qualify for the 2023 World Cup to be co- hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Banyana coach Desiree Ellis maintained a positive outlook ahead of another round of Covid-19 tests that will be conducted before the match on Thursday. The tournament which is underway in Morocco took centre stage for the first time in four years after the previous edition was cancelled due the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the last games which were played in Ghana 2018, Banyana reached the final of the tournament and lost on penalties to Nigeria.
