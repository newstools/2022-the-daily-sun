A 44-YEAR-OLD man was found with suspected stolen goods from a hijacked truck. Free State cops on Wednesday, 13 July, reacted to information about a warehouse possibly used to store goods from hijacked trucks. Sergeant Mahlomola Kareli said information led them to a warehouse at East End industrial park in Bloemfontein.  “On arrival, members found the warehouse owner and suspect, whom the stored property belonged to. The property, 1 680 boxes containing diesel engine catalytic converters worth an estimated value of R80 million, were found packed in the warehouse. The suspect could not produce proof of ownership and was arrested.” Kareli said that further investigations revealed that the loot came from a truck that was hijacked in May, travelling from the Eastern Cape to Gauteng.
