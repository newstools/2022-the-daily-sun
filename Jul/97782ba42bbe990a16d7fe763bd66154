THE youth of Phola in Ogies, Mpumalanga, has embarked on a drive to help local school kids choose good careers. And on Mandela Day, the youth held a career expo in the area. The expo co-ordinator, Thando Mahlangu (32), said they engaged pupils from grade 9 to grade 12. She said the aim was to build the community by helping kids choose the right path to a brighter future. Thando said she worked with Mpho Mtshula (30), Sibusiso Mbatha (32), Kamogelo Mthimunye (30) and Siyabonga Sibanyoni (28) in the expo. She told Daily Sun they helped pupils access information about career paths they could pursue after matric. “Many kids had difficulty choosing the right career path after matric. The expo provides them with a platform where they can access information regarding various career fields. We all know how it feels to complete school and not know which path to take,” she said. Sibusiso said building young people would help improve the living conditions of the community. “It is not a good thing when you have many young people who are unemployed and don’t know what to do. That results in a high rate of crime and the use of drugs,” he said. Mandla Masilela (16), a grade 10 pupil, said the career expo was an eye-opener for him. “It helped me chose a career to follow after matric. I’ve decided to become an engineer,” he said. A matric pupil, Nonkululeko Mabhena (18), said the expo came at the right time. “I was not sure which career path to follow, but I am now clear. I urge other pupils to take advantage of opportunities like this one,” she said.
