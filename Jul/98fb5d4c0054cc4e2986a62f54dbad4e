FOUR suspects were expected to appear in the East London Magistrates Court on Monday, 25 July, in connection with robbing the dead at Enyobeni Tavern last month. The four men, aged 16 and 21, face charges of theft, possession of suspected stolen property and defeating the ends of justice. Only the minor made a brief appearance and his matter was postponed to 30 August. The other accused are expected to appear on Tuesday, 26 July. Police arrested the accused as part of the investigation into the tragedy. The arrests are a sequel to the investigation which started immediately after the reported deaths of 21 children in the tavern. The investigation led the police to arrest the suspects believed to have been involved in stealing from the victims’ lifeless bodies at the scene. Police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said: “The stolen items recovered included shoes, weaves, clothes and a watch which belong to some of the children who died during the incident. “Some of the stolen items have been positively identified by families while others are yet to be identified.” He said the items were recovered at the homes of the suspects in Scenery Park in East London. “The suspects are not linked to the death of 21 children, as there is no evidence to suggest their involvement at this stage,” he said.
