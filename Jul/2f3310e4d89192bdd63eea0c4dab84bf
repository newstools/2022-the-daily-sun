SINGER Zahara has finally saved the house she was about to lose due to financial struggles. The Loliwe hitmaker has had a rough couple of months, but her fans pulled through and gave her the money she needed to hold on to her home. She spoke to the People’s Paper in May, asking for help from her fans and Kaizer Chiefs football club. She told Daily Sun that she had paid off her house for the next three months. “This tore me apart at first, which is why I spoke about it. I felt like I could have knocked on so many doors, but they were closed. But I knew that there would be someone out there who could listen and understand. All those R50 notes, R100 and R1 000 I got helped me,” she said.

Zahara added that the donated money also helped her take care of her family. “As I had mentioned on our last interview, things have been tough since my sister passed on. So, from the donations that came in, I would also take some and help my sister’s kids, my siblings, mum and dad. This has really helped, and now God has been opening doors. I’m working again,” she said. The singer said she was grateful to everyone who had donated the money. “I can’t even explain how I’m feeling right now. When I spoke about it, my family thought people would not care and thought I would be laughed at. But I told them rather that than open my legs for money,” she added.
