HARDLY three months after six children died due to galephirime poisoning, two more have followed. Cousins, aged three and four, have died after eating biscuits laced with the poison in Ivory Park. The little boy and girl died, at the clinic and hospital, while the third child, a four-year-old boy, has been left fighting for his life. The incident happened on Thursday, 21 July. Colonel Dimakatso Sello said the three kids apparently came into contact with the biscuits, laced with poison, at their home while it was being cleaned. A relative told police that the house owner, who was taking a bath, had asked a friend to clean.

One died at a local clinic and the other in hospital,” said Sello. This case follows that of three Ngobeni siblings who died after accidentally eating meat laced with galephirime in May. Before them, three brothers from Ratanda also died after being fed poison by their father, who has since died.

An inquest has been opened for further investigation, and an autopsy will be conducted to confirm the exact cause of death.
