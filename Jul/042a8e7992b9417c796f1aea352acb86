RESIDENTS of Dlamini, Soweto, together with JoziFM, hosted a candlelight ceremony for Khayalethu Magadla. They did this to show the family they're not alone and that Khayalethu is everyone's child. The six-year-old, who fell into a manhole at Dlamini on 12 June still hasn't been found. But not all hope is lost. Residents and pastors believe that God will guide them to the right place. They believe God will touch Khayalethu's heart from wherever he is and he'll be brought back home. Mhlongo Mpho of JoziFM gave his remarks to the family and encouraged the community to continue trusting in prayer. Grandfather, Samkelo Magadla, thanked the community for their support. He also emphasised that the family is optimistic that God will intervene in their ordeal.  Neighbours said the loving and bubbly Khayalethu had a bright future ahead of him. "I can't even begin to imagine what the family is going through. I'm sending them all the strength and love. Khayalethu will be found, with or without any technological equipment," said Botlale Mofokeng. Sandile Sithole gave thanks to everyone who attended the candle light ceremony.  "To say we're sad would be an understatement but we pray that God brings him back home," said Sandile. Pastor Phumzile Mduli prayed for the family. She encouraged them to always look to the Lord for strength no matter how difficult it seems.  "Khayalethu will be found and we believe that God will be the one to guide us," said Mdluli.
