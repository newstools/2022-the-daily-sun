CONTROVERSIAL Abathembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo has taken to TikTok like a duck to water. The dreadlocked king seems to be a hit in the short video platform and already has over 20 000 followers. Every time Dalindyebo, whose praise name is Zwelibanzi, makes a speech or addresses gatherings, he often leaves everyone in stitches. And there is no doubt that despite all his controversies, he is a much-loved figure. Whether poking fun at the ruling ANC which he dumped a few years ago following his well-documented fights with it’s leadership or bashing his critics, the king’s sense of humour is undeniable. His TikTok account is said to be run by the Abathembu royal council.
