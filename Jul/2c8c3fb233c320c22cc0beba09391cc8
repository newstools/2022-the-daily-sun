TWO suspects were caught red-handed transporting stolen diesel with a police van that had been converted into a fuel tanker in Delmas, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday, 20 July. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said officers were conducting patrol duties on the N12 when they noticed a suspicious white Nissan NP300 bakkie with two occupants. “The vehicle, with a GP registration number plate, looked rather strange as it appeared to be heavily loaded and was covered with a black canvas. The police ordered the driver to stop, followed by a search. And when they removed the canvas, they discovered that the back of the bakkie had been converted into a diesel tank,” he said.
