RESIDENTS of Midas are still shocked after a decomposed body of a man was seen floating inside the Morula Dam in Odi, near Mabopane, in Tshwane. They said the body was discovered on Sunday morning, 24 July by fishermen who alerted residents. Resident Agnes Lengwathi said they were wondering if the body was dumped there, or if it was taken by mamlambo (the river snake). She said the dam looks scary and it’s very rare for people to go near it. “We heard people shouting and we went outside to investigate. “When we got near the dam, we saw the floating body,” she said. “I called the police and the body was taken away. “If it wasn’t for the fishermen, no one would have seen the body.” She said they have been living in the area for many years and the dam still scared them. “We are wondering if there’s a mamlambo in this dam because we have previously heard stories about a river snake here,” she said. Another resident, Marriam Mthombeni, said the decomposed body of the dead man showed it had been there for a long time. “This dam is very scary. Even those who go fishing at the dam surprise us because they go so close. There is something about these waters that makes my blood run cold,” she said. “I really feel for this man because his family might be wondering where he is, and it will be difficult to identify him,” she said. Police spokeswoman, Colonel Dimakatso Sello confirmed that the body of an unidentified man was discovered in the dam. She said there were no details at this stage about the body, and that the police have opened an inquest docket for further investigations. Those who might have opened any missing persons cases are urged to contact the police to check if the body isn’t that of a missing relative.
