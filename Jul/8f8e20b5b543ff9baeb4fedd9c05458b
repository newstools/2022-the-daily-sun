AFTER 21 years of offering critical HIV/Aids services, Ithembalabantu Clinic in KZN is closing its doors. Patients at the facility in Umlazi will now be transferred to government health facilities. Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) announced that it had started the process of winding down operations. “While transitioning means Ithembalabantu Clinic will close its doors, patients will continue their care and have the opportunity to receive additional, comprehensive services at government clinics of their choice,” said AHF Africa bureau chief Dr Penninah Iutung. Iutung said the transfer meant they are now set to benefit from a more comprehensive package of health services beyond HIV/Aids. They are to receive treatment for sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, diabetes and hypertension as well as primary services and antenatal care. Over 14 000 patients have accessed services at the clinic since its inception in 2001. Ithembalabantu was run by AHF in partnership with the Department of Health through the provincial government. Iutung said they would ensure that patients were transferred in a smooth, organised and systematic manner. “We remain committed to supporting the HIV/Aids response in South Africa through our other provincial government clinics,” she emphasised. AHF is working closely with staff, the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and labour unions to ensure that employees are treated fairly. It currently supports 20 other facilities within eThekwini, and has a presence in Eastern Cape and Gauteng. – CAJ NEWS
