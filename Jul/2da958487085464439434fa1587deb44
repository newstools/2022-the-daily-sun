SHE was tired of being abused by her boyfriend and the father of her two children. To save her life, she left him and moved on with a new man. But her ex-boyfriend didn’t like this and started making her life hell. The 22-year-old said he chased her down the street with a knife, saying he wouldn’t allow his kids to be raised by another man. The woman from Magagula Heights, near Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni, said she opened a case and her ex was arrested on Friday 15 July. But she fears the 32-year-old might get bail and come back to finish what he started. “I’m not free because he vowed to make my life hell,” she said. “He’s not doing anything for his kids. I struggle to provide for them and I’m also not working. “I have moved on and he also has someone. We see how women are killed every day by men and I don’t want to turn into another statistic.” Her mum said the family was also living in fear. “He was disrespectful to his in-laws and we just wish he could be denied bail,” she said. The police confirmed a case of intimidation was opened at Zonkizizwe cop shop and a 32-year-old was arrested.
