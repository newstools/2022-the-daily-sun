BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis says the Nelson Mandela month has a special place in her heart as she realised her dream of donning the national team jersey on 11 February 1990, the day our late former president was released from prison. She is confident her girls will overcome hosts Morocco in the Women's Africa Cup of Nations final at Stade Prince Moulay on Saturday (9pm) to commemorate Mandela month in style. Ellis is delighted that her side beat neighbours Zambia 1-0 in the semi-final on Mandela day (Monday). Said Ellis: "When I made the national team at the age of 30 president Mandela was released from prison, that's when I got an opportunity to play for the national team. At the age of 30 I lost my job driving back in a Kombi (minibus) to make the national team. “But it was a dream of mine for a very long time, so I  am grateful to Tata Madiba, and to do it on Mandela Day, how amazing that is. He always said `Sport has the power to unite,' and I am sure our victory has united South Africa with all the adversity they are going through right now, the support they have given us has been amazing." Ellis also thanked Safa president Danny Jordaan for giving her team support throughout the years while he has also dangled a R9.2 million carrot in front of her players to ensure they win the trophy this time having reached the Awcon final five times. "Dr Jordaan is always around ensuring that things are okay, and I mean we are still here competing in the tournament and really it's an attitude of gratitude to say thank you to those people."
