SOMETIMES things can get hectic with life’s daily challenges, which can lead to loss of interest in tlof tlof. And in order to solve this, a 28-year-old woman has come up with an ingenious solution. Char Grey (23) and her husband Callum (28), from Warwickshire in England, have now introduced a life-like doll to spice up their sex life. The website metro.co.uk reports that the couple was initially open to exploring group sex in a bid to “spice things up”, but the wife had reservations and was worried she might get jealous. As a result, Char decided to buy the £1 500 (about R30 000) doll. READ: Is using a sex doll cheating? “We were talking about spicing things up and having a threesome or foursome. But like most girls, I was worried I’d struggle to see Callum with another woman. It was a joint decision to buy a sex doll, but it was the best and has definitely improved our sex life,” said Char. According to the publication, the hubby has a high sex drive and when she is not in the mood, then he has Dee (sex robot).

The husband and wife, who have been together four years, purchased the doll online in June 2022, after previously owning a doll that “just wasn’t doing it” for them. Instead, they opted for a more realistic model that bears a resemblance to blonde Char.
