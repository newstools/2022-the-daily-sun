FITNESS guru and influencer Sbahle Mpisane has recently been sharing stories about the hard times she faced after being involved in a car crash. The 29-year-old from Durban, KZN, took to Instagram on Thursday, 28 July, and shared stories about her suicidal thoughts. Sbahle wanted to let her followers know how she was doing after the incident in 2018. She said if it wasn’t for God, her therapists and other health workers, she wouldn’t be alive today. She wrote a mini statement narrating her experiences. “In 2018 while in hospital, I attempted to hang myself but my nurse walked in. “In 2019, I planned my suicide attempt but woke up four days later. I apologised and promised God not to test Him again as He saved my life three times,” she wrote. Sbahle said she also had suicidal thoughts last year. The fitness guru said it wasn’t a pleasant year for her as it was filled with stress, anger and worries. ALSO READ:Top actress announces pregnancy!

Sbahle said she was now doing a little bit better. “I find more relaxation by being with my family and my skin renewal has been the cherry on top,” she said. Sbahle said what worries her is that because of the accident, she doesn’t have an ankle bone. “But I don’t plan to commit suicide. My therapist and my psychologist have placed me under medication,” she said. The fitness bunny said she is grateful for life even though she still feels weak sometimes.
