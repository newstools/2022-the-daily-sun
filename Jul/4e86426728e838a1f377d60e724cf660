Mthandeni Dlamuka has passed on. The reality TV star, Dlamuka who was loved by Mzansi for always putting his son in his place has died following a long illness. Moja Love's Isencane lengane will never be the same without him, these are the words of Mzansi. His son Siyacela Dlamuka announced his death earlier today on social media and Mzansi has been sending their heartfelt condolences to uMkhulu. A close family friend who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that it is indeed true, the old man has died. Mzansi has expressed how they'll always remember the kind of man he was and how true he always has been. He always guided his son, even though they butt heads most of the time, they didn't stop him from reprimanding him when he was wrong. "RIP Mr Dlamuka. At least he was a truthful father who told him straight isithuphethu. We'll always love you," Nozbu tweeted. "Isencane lengane will never be the same without him. Rest in peace Mr Dlamuka. Let's hope Siyacela will take some of the lessons that his old man taught him," said Sibusiso Zondo.
