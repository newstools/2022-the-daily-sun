WHEN the volunteers from Joy Clinic in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, bought paint and went to paint the house where mkhulu Buti Fulane (75) lives, they thought they were doing the right thing. But they were in for a rude surprise. Mkhulu’s son, Makaringe Fulane (33), turned them away on Monday, 18 July, saying people were using Mandela Day just to shine. He told volunteers to take their paint and leave. The volunteers had to call the cops to come and intervene. The angry son told the police that he didn’t want people to come and take photos of his home. “Why should they act as if they care just because it’s Mandela Day?” said Makaringe. But eventually, the police persuaded him to co-operate.  Sister Sindiswa Mbatha of Joy Clinic said they were touched by mkhulu’s living conditions and came together to paint his house. “Mkhulu comes to the clinic to receive his medication,” said and we got know him there Sindiswa. “What mkhulu’s son did is abusive. We are doing all this work for mkhulu and not for the son,” she told Daily Sun. Residents said the son was behaving badly.  about his father and he wanted to dominate the old man. “Why would he turn down help while he does not contribute anything to his father’s life and he is lazy to work?” said one of the residents. They said the son often brings friends to the house and doesn’t respect mkhulu. Etwatwa police warned mkhulu’s son not to disrupt the efforts of the volunteers.
