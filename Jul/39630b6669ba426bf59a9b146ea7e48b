THE assassination of regent Samson Buthelezi brings the number of traditional leaders who have been killed in KZN since 2019 to 44. Buthelezi (66) of the Jama Traditional Community in Nquthu, northern KZN, was shot at his home by unknown gunmen on Wednesday 6 July. They fatally wounded him and even shot his dog before fleeing the scene. Ubumbano Lwezinduna general secretary, Charles Malinga, said traditional leaders were living in fear. “As long as these killings are not taken seriously by government, we will continue to live a life of looking over one shoulder at all times,” he said. “This brings the number of assassinated leaders to 44 and government has not even appointed a task team to investigate these matters.” The Buthelezi family asked for privacy to mourn.
