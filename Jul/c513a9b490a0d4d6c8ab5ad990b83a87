WHILE Sebenzile Mngwenyama (23) was still trying to come to terms with the death of the father of her unborn child, Sphethoxolo Chiliza (26), she now has to deal with the death of her brother, Philani Mngwenyama (20). The pair were shot at the Mdlalose tavern shooting in Soweto on Sunday, 10 July, when armed men sprayed AK47 bullets onto the patrons. Sphethoxolo died on the spot while Philani died a day after at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. Sebenzile and her mum, Siziwe Mngwenyama (45), were hoping that Philani would pull through, but their hopes came crashing down after they visited the hospital on Monday and were told he was no more. “The hospital said many bullets hit him in the stomach,” said Siziwe. Philani’s death brought the number of those who lost their lives to 16. Siziwe told Daily Sun: “I thought he was going to be okay. “I saw three wounds but it turned out more bullets were left inside.” She said Philani will be buried in Mzimkhulu in KZN, and they’ll perform a ritual of getting his spirit from the tavern. Siziwe said they had not seen the tavern owner. “He has neither called nor spoken to us,” she said. Sebenzile said the loss of her brother and boyfriend was hard to handle. She told the People’s Paper: “It’s painful.” With the baby coming, she said she didn’t know what she would do. Describing Philani, his mum said: “He was quiet and humble. When you reprimanded him he’d keep quiet and would never answer back.” She said Philani wanted to build her a house in KZN. “When he got piece jobs, he would always buy food for us.”
