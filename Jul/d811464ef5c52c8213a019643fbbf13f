THE little ones at Injabulo Day-care Centre in Small Farms in Evaton, Vaal, have not enjoyed much this past month. Their joy was stolen when raw sewage from a manhole started spilling into the yard, and now they only have a tiny space to use. Parents and teachers said they reported the mess to the municipality several times, but it kept promising to fix it soon. Teacher Nontsikelelo Dlwathi said the sewage even affected the water in the kitchen. “It is frustrating because the municipality does not seem to take us seriously. It keeps saying it is coming. This will end up making kids sick, if it has not affected them already. We are pleading with them to fix this messy mud.” Gogo Deliwe Mtimkulu (mid-80s), the mastandi where the creche is located, no longer enjoys her food and walking in her yard. The sewage was spilling into her kitchen stoep. She said: “I have to pop out R40 everyday to the boys who hang around the street to clean my yard. Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to survive. The municipality must clean this.” ALSO READ: MDLALOSE TAVERN TRAGEDY: Sebenzile lost boyfriend, now brother Her daughter, Mtomkhulu Makelefane, said she felt sorry for her as she loved cleanliness. “I know my mum is tidy. This makes me sick with anger. The sewage is right at her kitchen door. The smell is so unbearable.” According to Emfuleni Municipality, the water and sanitation unit was “doing everything in its power to contain spillages”. Spokesman Makhosonke Sangweni said: “The municipality is faced with a lot of sewer challenges. Most are related to ageing infrastructure and some due to factors such as throwing foreign objects in the network. “The challenge in Small Farms, Sebokeng and Evaton has been high on the list of priorities. Teams are sent for blockages, but the problem needs more than regular unblocking.”
