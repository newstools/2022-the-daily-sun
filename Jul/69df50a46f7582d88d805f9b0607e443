BANYANA Banyana have booked their place in the Africa Women Cup of Nation quarterfinal following a 3-1 thrashing of Burundi in their second Group C match at Stade Moulay Hassan in Rabat on Thursday night. Banyana are now a step away from achieving their main target of qualifying for the Fifa World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July 2023. The four Awcon semi-finalists qualify for the greatest competition. Burundi’s hopes of going further in the competition went up in smokes having lost their opening match 4-2 to Botswana on Monday. Desiree Ellis coached side came into the match with their heads held high having beaten defending champions Nigeria 4-2 in their opening match at the same venue on the same day increasing their chances of winning their maiden trophy. They were also motivated by the fact that six of their players Andile Dlamini, Bambanani Mbane, Thembi Kgatlana, Jermaine Seoposenwe, Refiloe Jane and Linda Motlhalo were nominated for the Caf Player of the Year award. Banyana could have won the game by an avalanche of goals, but they were too complacent especially in the first half having missed plenty of clear-cut scoring chances with star striker Kgatlana and Seoposenwe being the main culprit. Kgatlana finally grabbed the opening goal with a cool finish in the 20th minute following a series of counter attacks. Aniella Uwimana gave Burundi a rare equaliser in the 30th minute, but their joy was short-lived as midfielder Amogelang Motau restored Banyana’s cushion two minutes later. Linda Motlhalo, who was voted man of the match against Nigeria also made an immediate impact as she also registered her name on the score sheet from the penalty spot in the 52nd minute. She showed Seoposenwe how it’s done after she missed from the penalty spot in the first half. Burundi ended the game with 10 players after Annociate Nshirimana was sent off for a foul on Seoposenwe. Banyana will now go into their last group match against Botswana on Sunday without pressure.
