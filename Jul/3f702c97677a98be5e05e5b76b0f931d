EMFULENI municipal officials and security guards were thrown out of their offices by members of the  Azanian People’s Liberation Army (Apla)  Veterans’ Association on Monday morning, 25 July. The association said they were unhappy that the municipality had adopted a welfare policy for all veterans, but had not implemented it. Association regional chairman, Bongani Majola, told Daily Sun that last month, they gave the municipality 13 working days to implement the policy. The gatvol group chased all officials out of their offices and the main building. They demanded full time jobs in the municipal offices. The angry veterans unsuccessfully tried to meet the mayor, the speaker of the council and the ANC chief whip to seek answers. They alleged that members were promised positions in the public safety department and benefits. A protester said: “They promised us jobs at ANC conferences but, nothing happened.” An official said some of the protesters claimed they’d been in exile, but they were too young. He said they were fraudulently using the force numbers of people who had died. Municipal spokesman Makhosonke Sangweni said what the protesters did was unacceptable and criminal. He said the municipality will take steps to protect its employees so that they could continuing serving communities.
