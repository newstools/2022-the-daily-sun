Mahlobo is the former Minister of State Security Agency (SSA), which was also featured in the State Capture report. It is alleged that Mahlobo gave former President Jacob Zuma millions of rands. According to the party’s spokesman Dennis Bloem the charges will be laid on Monday morning, 4 July, 10 am at the Lyttleton Police in Pretoria. Bloem said Madisha will also announce COPE’S demands to the Speaker of Parliament with regards to all Members of Parliament who are implicated in the Zondo Commission “The allegations contained in the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture (Zondo Commission) are very serious. The looting and abuse of taxpayer's money under the guise of State Security, must never be tolerated in the country it is dangerous, therefore needs immediate action from the criminal justice system. He added, “Some of the allegations against Mr David Mahlobo in the Zondo Commission Report is that Mr Mahlobo involved himself in operational matters at State Security Agency and that large amounts of cash were delivered to him on several occasions. Bloem said COPE wants to see action taken against all those fingered in the Zondo Commission Report, to us the implementation of the Zondo Commission's recommendations must take centre stage. “We will continuously approach the police to lay criminal charges against different people whom the Commission recommends that the Hawks must investigate and charge. “We will request the Hawks to treat these cases as priority cases, speed up the investigation, and arrest and charge Mr David Mahlobo,” he said.
