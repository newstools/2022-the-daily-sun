MINISTER of Health Dr Joe Phaahla on Tuesday, 19 July, tested positive for Covid-19 after experiencing minor symptoms. According to his spokesman Foster Mohale, Phaahla took tests on the day, and results later came back positive. He immediately started self-isolating. Mohale said the minister would perform his official duties from home for a period of seven days, and that all his planned contact meetings had rescheduled while others converted into virtual. “This is a reminder that the pandemic still remains among us and is infectious, hence the department continues to report Covid-19 daily positive cases and deaths,” he said. Mohale said Phaahla had received two doses of the J&J vaccine, that he believed had boosted his immunity against the severity of the virus. “The department would like to remind the public that lifting the Covid-19 restrictions doesn’t mean that the pandemic is over, hence vaccination remains accessible at all times at selected sites.”
