A MAN allegedly stole R13 000 to visit his girlfriend. And this had him trending on social media. The incident was shared on social media by Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko. She was in Alexandra on Saturday, 16 July for Okae Molao operation. Mazibuko said community patrollers found the man walking in Alex carrying R13 300. His explanation was that he wanted to steal R100 from his mother for a taxi so that he could go to his girlfriend in Joburg. He realised that his mother would catch him, so he took the whole amount from her bag. Mzansi has been laughing and commending him for stealing to go see his girlfriend. “We know this is a lie but we’ll have to commend him for having this kind of an excuse. That’s money mugged from residents of Alex,” said one user. Mark Nkuna said this is definitely money mugged from the residents of Alex. “I hope they lock him up and send a strong message to those who think they can do as they please in these streets,” he said. Gugulethu Mngwevu said she didn’t understand where the crime is when all he did was steal from his mum, who didn’t report any case to the police. “He just loves his girlfriend and people should leave him alone. It’s his mum’s money at the end of the day,” said Gugulethu.
