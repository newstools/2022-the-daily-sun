ACTRESS Mona Monyane is off the market! The former Muvhango actress took to social media to share that she was engaged and happy. She was previously married to actor Khulu Skenjana, and they got divorced in 2020. Announcing the news, Mona excitedly said people should get their wedding dresses ready. She had posted a photo of her and her fiance’s hand, with the caption: “I took a few years to unpack; to unravel and allow myself to truly feel pain. I took a few years to prioritise not only healing, but also loving myself. It cost me a lot of friends, time, money and family. It cost me making very scary choices and decisions that considered no one else’s opinion but my own.” Mona continued, adding that the darkness was real.

I deserved what my heart desired, even if I couldn’t see it in my pain. It was definitely worth waiting for me in my joy.” The actress said she prayed for a man who would love her the way she deserved, and she had found him. “When I wept and prayed for God to bring me a man who would love me the way I knew I wanted and deserved to be loved, I couldn’t have anticipated how that manifestation would unfold. I am safe; I am loved; I am seen,” she wrote. Her industry colleagues quickly started congratulating her on the engagement. Samkelo Ndlovu commented: “Congratulations Mona. You deserve everything great, coming and happening.” Then Inno Sadiki said: “OMG, I’m so happy for you! Congratulations, you deserve all the love in this world. Speaking blessings upon you both.” A post shared by Mona Monyane (@mona.monyane)  A post shared by Mona Monyane (@mona.monyane)
