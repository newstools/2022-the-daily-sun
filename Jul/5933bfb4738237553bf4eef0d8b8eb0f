NEWLY-ELECTED African National Congress (ANC) Gauteng chairman Panyaza Lesufi has identified three areas he will target to help the party win back voters in the province in 2024. Talking to journalists on the sidelines of the second leg of the provincial elective conference in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, on Sunday 10 July, he said it needed to be asked whether the governing party was capable of delivering services to the masses. In opening the second leg of the conference, Lesufi acknowledged the challenge he faced and that winning back the trust of people in the province would be difficult. The decline in ANC support has been a trend for years and it became even more pronounced when the party lost three metros in Gauteng in the 2019 elections. Addressing delegates at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Lesufi reminded them that the party had exactly 19 months to regain the support it had lost before the 2024 national election. “You will agree with me that within those 19 months, there is no time to play. Within those 19 months, we have no time to point fingers. “We need a disciplined movement and disciplined members who will marshal us to victory in 2024,” he said.
