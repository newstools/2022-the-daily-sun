TSHEPANG Ngoqi was allegedly beaten to death by community members in Kgabalatsane, North West after he was found in a resident’s yard on Monday, 25 July. The 15-year-old died at a hospital in Mabopane, Tshwane, later in the evening. His mother, Nomsa Ngoqi (37), said doctors told her he died from internal bleeding. She said her son was beaten with sjamboks, pipes and other things while in his school uniform. Nomsa said when her son left for school that morning, she didn’t think it was the last time she’d see him alive. “My child didn’t say goodbye to me,” she said. She said the school principal called her at about 10am to tell her that her child was being beaten by residents. She said she still couldn’t understand why her son was in that house. “After he was found in the yard, I’m told he ran into the owner’s house to hide. He did all that after he saw angry community members running into the yard. “I’m told my son told them he wanted food to eat. “My son was a good boy, sweet and full of jokes.” Nomsa said she wants justice for her son and said God will deal with people who killed her son.  Family friend, Isaac Mokgadi (51), said: “It was painful to see Tshepang being beaten by the community.” Tshepang will be buried at Kgabalatsane cemetery on Saturday, 30 July. North West police spokeswoman Captain Aafje Botma said: “A murder case was opened and no arrests have been made yet.”
