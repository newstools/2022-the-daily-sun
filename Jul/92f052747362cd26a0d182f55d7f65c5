WITH less than a week to go to the KZN African National Congress (ANC) elective conference, candidates have been visiting various branches to gain support. The provincial conference is expected to kick off at the Olive Convention Centre in Durban on Friday, 22 July. The race to become provincial chair is between current treasurer, Nomusa Dube- Ncube, Premier Sihle Zikalala, who is hoping to be re-elected to the position, AmaZulu FC boss, Sandile Zungu and provincial executive committee member, Siboniso Duma. Dube-Ncube seems to have received a boost from members who believe it’s time for a woman to become leader. The Women’s League has also given its support. However, there are potential obstacles in her path as there are rumours that she will be investigated for corruption, which may even start before the conference. This could mean her exclusion due to the step aside rule. Over the weekend, her office confirmed she was approached by law enforcement agencies but refused to give details. “We prefer not to comment any further until further notice,” reads a short statement. Her chief lobbyist, Wiseman Ngobese, said his camp was aware that she was approached but would continue supporting her. Meanwhile, many were surprised when it emerged Zungu had managed to win the support of a number of branches in the midlands. On Sunday, 17 July, he visited the inkosi of the Zungu clan in Ulundi to hand over gifts, including cows. He then addressed members in the Mzala Nxumalo region. Zikalala has not been campaigning much as he has already won the support of some of the strongest factions in the province.
