HE had been consulting with the prophet for three days as he had been having strange dreams. So on Wednesday 20 July, he underwent a healing process at a sacred space in the veld. While in the veld, the man suddenly told the prophet he wanted to relieve himself. But he instead allegedly came back carrying a big rock. And while the prophet was kneeling to pray, the patient allegedly hit him twice on the head. The police said Prophet Josania Mutanda (52) died on the spot. His devastated wife, Chiedza Magazine (48), said her husband’s unexpected passing has shocked her to the core. She said her husband was the breadwinner. “I’m not feeling well. I don’t how I am going to support my family.” Relative James Mutanda said: “I know that he used to go to the veld to pray. He used to go there to ask for blessings.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said a 23-year-old man from Kaalfontein was arrested for the murder. Police said the suspect and his mother consulted with the prophet after he experienced some strange visions. The mother was present at the healing session. “His mother and the prophet never saw it coming.” She said the suspect was arrested and charged with murder. He appeared in the Tembisa Magistrates Court on Thursday, 21 July and will make a second appearance in the coming days.
