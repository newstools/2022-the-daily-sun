THE family of murdered Kutlwano Kasibe held placards during a demonstration on Thursday, 7 July. Family members gathered outside the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto, calling for his suspected killers to be denied bail. Only three out of four suspects appeared. The whereabouts of the fourth were unclear, and the National Prosecuting Authority had not responded at the time of going to print. The matter was postponed to Monday, 11 July, due to load shedding. Kutlwano (16), who was mentally challenged, was tied to a tree last month then doused with ice water and sanitiser. He was sjambokked and shocked with a car battery by community members, claiming he had stolen a tap. He was then dragged to the side of the road, where his mum found him. Days later, four suspects, aged between 30 and 40, were arrested. ALSO READ |
