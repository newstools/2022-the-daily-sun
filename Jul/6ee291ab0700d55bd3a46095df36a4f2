TOMBSTONE vandalism is increasing at several cemeteries and families are worried. Some families are talking about having people to guard the resting places of their ancestors. On Wednesday, 13 July, a woman spotted two guys leaving with pieces of a tombstone in a wheelbarrow at Slovo Cemetery, Soweto. There was nothing she could do because she was alone and feared that she might be attacked if she confronted the men. This is also happening at Avalon and Doornkop cemeteries in Soweto. Evan Muhlari (33) said: “A month ago I visited my brother’s grave at Avalon and next to it there were two destroyed graves.” Sphamandla Shandu (38) said last month he chased away a boy who had a wheelbarrow with pieces of a tombstone. “When I questioned where he found the pieces of stones, he ran away and left behind the wheelbarrow,” he said. Elizabeth Mabona (55) said her sister’s grave was also vandalised three months ago, a few days before the unveiling ceremony. “We were devastated because no one in the family is employed. We had to cancel the unveiling ceremony. We don’t know how long it’ll take for us to raise money again,” said Elizabeth. Daily Sun spoke to City Parks spokesman Reggie Moloi, who said vandalism was happening because fencing was being stolen, leaving gaps for anyone to access the cemetery. He said that there were security guards at the gates who searched vehicles that came in and out of the cemetery. “Cemeteries are huge and we can’t have eyes everywhere. One can be patrolling on one side and another person might be doing something else on the other side. We need help from communities,” he said.
