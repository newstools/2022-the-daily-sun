GAUTENG education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said gone are the days when all schools followed the same curriculum. He said the Department of Education was introducing schools where pupils would be groomed to be employers or head-hunted for their skills. “The time to produce pupils that join the ranks of the unemployed is over,” he said. Lesufi was speaking at the launch of Tembisa Commerce and Entrepreneurship School of Specialisation in Ibazelo section on Tuesday, 26 July. This is the 28th School of Specialisation (SoS) to be launched by the department. Lesufi said the aim was to have 35 schools across Gauteng. “It’s only in South Africa that 80% of matriculants still want to go to university. In most developed countries, only 20% do. We also want to change this mindset,” he said. Lesufi said these schools were performing better than ordinary ones as most subjects were practical. He said the aim of speciality schools was to nurture talent across key disciplines and develop the future generation of leaders. Thembisa SoS is the first entrepreneurship one in Ekurhuleni Municipality, with the main focus in tourism and hospitality. He urged students and communities to protect the equipment in schools. Pupils said they were excited about the experience they would get from the school and wanted to take it further. Grade 12 pupil Refilwe Futhane said she was motivated to pursue studies to become a food inspector. Another grade 12 pupil Kamogelo Ndlovu said he was planning to open his own bakery in the future.
