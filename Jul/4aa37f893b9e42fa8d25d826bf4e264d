IT HAS been two weeks since Siphiwe Moyane’s three-months-old son died, but she has not been able to bury him. The 19-year-old girl from Soshanguve block H, Tshwane, said she had not been able to eat or sleep well since her son died on 1 July because she could not afford to bury him. Her son died suddenly after being rushed to hospital when he was struggling to breathe. He was declared dead on arrival. “His body was taken by forensics to determine the cause of death but when they were done, they could not tell me what killed my son. They told me that the undertaker responsible for his body would tell me when they issue a death certificate,” she told Daily Sun.

Siphiwe said she was unemployed, and with no parents to help her. “It has been a terrible two weeks of seeking help from people, but no one has come through,” she said, adding that even the father of the baby was not working. “I’m tired and I don’t know what to do. “I don’t even have a place for the funeral because even were we are staying we’ve been tol vacate the place,” she said. Siphiwe told the People’s paper that she needed R3 500 to pay for the grave, coffin and burial company. “I just want to lay him to rest. I don’t care about food and other things,” she said. Daily Sun spoke to local Councillor Rose Sithole, who said she was aware of Siphiwe’s challenge. She said she had escalated the matter to social workers, and the child would be buried by the government. “I’m working with social workers and we will be assisting her even after the burial.” But for now, all Siphiwe can do is wait until something happens.
