The members were led to a house in Klarinet, Emalahleni and upon arrival, they found two suspects in possession of the hijacked vehicle. “They also found suspected stolen property such as a chainsaw, water pump and three toy guns. The suspects were then arrested,” said Mohlala. He said the police also discovered that the suspects did not have proper documentation to be in South Africa and members are working in collaboration with the Department of Home Affairs to ascertain their status in the country. The Mpumalanga police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela, has welcomed the sterling work done by cops. “We hope that the breakthrough will also help to solve other outstanding cases around the Emalahleni area and surroundings,” she said.
