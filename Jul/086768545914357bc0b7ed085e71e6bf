A MAN appeared in court on Monday 25 July for allegedly luring women into a van and raping them. The man, who sold ice cream, allegedly got young women to enter his van with the promise of jobs before giving them ice cream laced with a substance. He then raped them. He appeared in the Atlantis Magistrates Court in the Western Cape. The 50-year-old man was arrested in a dramatic fashion after a victim pointed him out to cops while he was driving his pink and white ice cream van. Cops stopped the vehicle and the driver was arrested. The man, an Egyptian national who lives in Mitchells Plain in Cape Town, was arrested in Witsand on Friday 22 July. He allegedly tried to bribe cops not to arrest him. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said: “Members of the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit conducted a tracing operation in Witsand. “The complainant pointed at a man in a vehicle, indicating that he was the suspect in a rape case. The police members then stopped the vehicle and apprehended the driver. The 50-year-old man was arrested and detained on a charge of rape.” National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Eric Ntabazalila confirmed the incident after the man appeared in court. “The accused, dubbed the ice cream rapist, is charged with rape, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and corruption,” he said. “The charge of corruption relates to his attempt to bribe the investigating officer with R10 000 for the case to be withdrawn. His case has been postponed to 1 August for a bail application to be heard.”
