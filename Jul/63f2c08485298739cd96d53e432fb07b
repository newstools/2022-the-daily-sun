DAILY SUN called on readers to vote for their favourite business in 145 different categories, to determine the top five winners in each category. In Daily Sun 2022 Your Choice survey, readers were able to cast their vote online for their favourite businesses. Readers were asked to send in their email addresses using the link that was provided on social media to enter. Forum24 panelists also indicated in the registration questionnaire that they also invited readers. The survey consisting of the 145 categories was then emailed to all entrants and they were given 12 days (18 to 29 April 2022) to complete the survey. The survey gave a category and it was completely open ended (unprompted) as to who the favourite business or brand wa s in each category – respondents typed up the name of their favourite choice in each category. All in all 1011 respondents completed the survey. Any sample over 100 is considered statistically stable and a sample of 1000 is extremely reliable and statistically solid. For a readership of 1 176 000 (Daily Sun’s readership) a sample of 385 is considered valid (95% confidence, 5% margin of error). If we use Daily Sun’s gross (duplicated reach) and include online UBs, and assume an audience of 3.5m, the needed sample size for 95% confidence with 5% margin of error is still 385. If we want 99% confidence, 666 is the recommended sample size. With 1000 responses, we have a very reliable sample and can be confident that the results are reliable and accurately reflect Daily Sun readers’ choice of their top brands.
