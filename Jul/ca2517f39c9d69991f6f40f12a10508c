PATIENCE Bhunzani (37) was convicted and sentenced for corruption by the Douglas Regional Court on Monday, 18 July. Bhunzani was arrested in December 2019 after a search and seizure was conducted at her residence. Police spokesman Captain Tebogo Thebe said the Hawks’ serious commercial crime investigation team found the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) cards, bank cards and Identity Documents in her possession.  “During the search, she tried to entice a police officer in order to evade arrest,” Thebe said. On the charge of contravention of the National Credit Act, she was sentenced to a fine of R10 000 or five years in jail, wholly suspended for three years. Then for corruption, a fine of R15 000 was imposed or sentence of eight years in jail, suspended for five years with conditions. The accused was on bail throughout the trial.
