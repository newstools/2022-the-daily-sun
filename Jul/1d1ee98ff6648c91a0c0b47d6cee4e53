Thando spoke to Daily Sun about their son, Lubanzi. “Siyacela and I are extremely excited about our baby boy. This is the biggest blessing in our marriage. There are things we are learning along the way as first time parents. Maternal instincts are kicking in on my side,” said Thando. She said Lubanzi was named by her late father-in-law, Mthandeni Dlamuka, who was a fan favourite on the show. He died on 10 July after a long illness.

The young parents said they’re still getting used to parenting and are learning every day. “Being new and first time parents is never easy. Each day is a learning curve for the both of us. It is hard to pinpoint one challenge, but with every challenge navigating this parenting journey, we learn something,” she said. “Our child is a blessing and with such a blessing comes great responsibility. We have had to make some changes in our life now that the baby is here. We cope by taking turns and by remembering who we were before the baby. Self-care is priority in order to take care of our child.” Thando said Lubanzi will feature on the show, but not too much. “Viewers will see the baby as part of our life, but we won’t be over sharing the life of our baby,” she said. They also said their family has been supportive since they became parents. “We have a supportive family. They are hands on and help every step of the way, showing us traditional rituals that need to be done for the baby,” she said.
