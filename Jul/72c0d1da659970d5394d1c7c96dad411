SUSPENDED public protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has vowed to continue with her application to challenge her suspension. Despite the Public Protector’s Office’s intention to withdraw from the matter, Mkhwebane told Daily Sun her attorneys had agreed to pursue the matter pro bono. She described the actions of the acting public protector, Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka, as premature. In a letter dated 6 July and addressed to the court registrar, Gcaleka said she had not briefed the lawyers to appeal the matter. “Please note that Seanego Attorneys Inc were not authorised, instructed or briefed by me to deliver the aforementioned application for leave to appeal,” it read. “In the circumstances, we intend to deliver the notice of withdrawal of the aforementioned application for leave to appeal.” ALSO READ |
Meet Mzansi's dumb thugs Gcaleka said she would also notify the court that Seanego Attorneys would no longer represent the Public Protector’s Office. Mkhwebane insisted that Gcaleka had no power to make such an instruction and this matter was dealt with by the institution’s CEO. She said the lawyers were appointed by the institution’s former CEO. “I applied as public protector of SA, not the office. She decided not to fund me and the legal team will do the application pro bono,” she said. In her letter, Gcaleka opened the door for Mkhwebane to pursue the matter personally but Mkhwebane was adamant that she would deal with the matter in her capacity as public protector and personally because the decision was made while she was still in office. On her personal relations with Gcaleka, Mkhwebane said: “I did not have issues with her but she might have been harbouring hatred towards me.”
