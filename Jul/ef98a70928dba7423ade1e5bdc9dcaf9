ADVOCATE Malesela Teffo has withdrawn from the counsel of accused one to four in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial. He made the explosive announcement at the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane on Tuesday, 12 July. “I can no longer continue in this court based on the harassment I am receiving, both from the state and court,” he said. Teffo said he would now revert to his position as a watching brief for the Meyiwa family, as approached by the deceased’s brother. “The reason I can no longer be in court and face you is that there are serious allegations here, where you are accused number one,” Teffo told the judge. He said he was prevented from being part of the trial because he was a problematic advocate, and that his arrest on 28 April was part of the plan hatched to remove him from representing the accused. “I am a human being. I have feelings too. I demand to be respected. If I respect you, I demand to be respected too.” Teffo told the court that the accused had been notified by his decision, and welcomed it. Advocate George Baloyi and Advocate Zandile Mshololo said they did not object to the withdrawal.
