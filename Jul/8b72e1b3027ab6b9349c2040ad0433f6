THE stolen dog had already been sold – but cops managed to rescue it before the buyer arrived. It was stolen on Wednesday, 13 July, in Cape Town and cops started hunting for the thief. Police spokesman Wayne Dyason said officers managed to recover the stolen dog after they saw a video of the thief. It was showing a man lifting a dog over a wall from inside a residence in Strand. “A clip, trending on social media, showed a man lifting a dog over a wall. An alert officer recognised the house and confirmed with residents that the dog was theirs,” said Dyason. The owner, who did not want to be named, told Daily Sun that she was very upset. She said her male pit bull was only seven months old. “I’m so glad that he’s safely home,” she said.

Meanwhile, on 7 July, inspectors of the Cape of Good Hope SPCA and law enforcement: animal control unit, rescued three puppies that were being trained for dogfighting in Parkwood. SPCA chief inspector Jaco Pieterse said they were shown a video of a group of youngsters, some seven, teasing three pit bull pups to attack each other. One tried to get away but was held tightly on a leash and forced to defend himself. He said the SPCA will open a case against the culprits. “Dogfighting is a barbaric sport and has no place in society. “Rescued dogs are being kept at an undisclosed location for their safety and that of our staff,” said Pieterse.
