EVERY night, a 39-year-old woman finds herself in a desperate battle with a tokoloshe. It wants to poke her but she refuses. “I don’t sleep at night because this aggressive tokoloshe fights with me. It wants to rape me and I’m not going to allow it,” she said. And she wakes up extremely tired in the morning. The woman from TV Section near Westonaria, Mogale City, said the evil creature goes as far as giving her hot klaps for refusing to have sex with it. “I hear it when it creeps into my bed and I fight so it doesn’t overpower me,” she said. “Some people might think I’m crazy but these things exist.” She said every night is like a battlefield. “I can’t go on like this.” She said her troubles started two years after her husband died in 2010 and her elders allowed her to have another husband. But instead the tokoloshe came into her life. “I can’t have a tokoloshe as a second husband,” she said. She survives as a recycler and collects scrap metal. Her late husband was a mine worker. Her sister-in-law said she told her about her tokoloshe problem. “I advised her to seek help as there could be someone who wants her spirit. It sounds like a tokoloshe but it could be more.” Sangoma Khethiwe Ndlovu said it looks like the woman has been cursed with cheeky tokoloshe Mpondolo and she needs a strong sangoma to remove the curse. “The tokoloshe is aggressive and needs a sangoma who knows what they are doing,” said Khethiwe.
