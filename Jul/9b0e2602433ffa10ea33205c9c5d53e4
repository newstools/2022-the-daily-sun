THE Hawks in Northern Cape arrested a 28-year-old suspect for business robbery on Monday, 4 July. According to Captain Tebogo Thebe, it is alleged that two unknown suspects entered a post office in Mankurwane, Vergenoeg, early on that day. “The suspects pointed employees with what looked like a firearm and stole about R230 000. “Community members followed the suspects and managed to arrest one suspect at a nearby house, not far from the crime scene,” Thebe said. He said the suspect was found with an amount of R110 000 in his possession. The suspect is expected to appear in the Galeshewe Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 6 July. “Hawks are still on the trail of the second suspect and the investigation is continuing,” Thebe added.
