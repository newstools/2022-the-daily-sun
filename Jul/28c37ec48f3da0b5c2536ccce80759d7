THE DA in Joburg on Tuesday, 5 June, took to the streets to protest the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA Bill) that it has claimed is attacking mother-tongue education. The party members marched to the offices of the Gauteng Department of Education, with the DA’s federal council chair Helen Zille and shadow minister of basic education Baxolile Nodada in the forefront. The BELA Bill proposes changes to the South African Schools Act. And one seeks to hand control to the department in determining a school’s language policy, curriculums, the prohibition of corporal punishment and initiation practices. It was introduced in Parliament in January, but has been criticised, with some arguing that it will give Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga extraordinary powers to override school governing bodies. In a statement issued by Nodada on Sunday, 19 June, he said: “MEC Panyaza Lesufi plans to use the BELA Bill for his racial crusade to vilify Afrikaans in schools. This bill, that seeks to remove the powers of SGBs and, after an appeal, leaves them at the mercy of MECs like Lesufi, is only a tool to further discriminate against Afrikaans as a language and its speakers.” Lesufi, in an interview with Newzroom Afrika, said he was surprised that the DA came to his office because the Bill was proposed by the minister. “It was strange, and I’m still surprised because it’s the minister who introduced the Bill, not the MEC. It’s the minister who has tabled the Bill in parliament. Why come to my office and not the minister’s? “They want to justify it by saying I have strong views against the Afrikaans language, which is not true.”
