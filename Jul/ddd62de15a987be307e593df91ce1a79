FORMER community health workers have been camping at the offices of the Gauteng Department of Health for almost two weeks demanding to be reinstated. The workers’ representative, Getrude Sebopa, said at least 9 100 workers worked in various health facilities in Gauteng and 126 workers were left in the cold without any explanation by the department. “We have tried to engage with the department more than five times to resolve the matter. We are tired of waiting, we need our jobs back,” she said. She said they served the community voluntarily for more than five years. “We want our jobs back and all our payback,” she said. Gauteng health spokesman Motalatale Modiba said: “The department had several engagements with the protestors’ leadership, but unfortunately we could not find each other on the matter.” Modiba said the matter was reported to the police and despite several visits to the building, they have not been successful in removing the protesters. “We are also working on getting a court interdict to vacate the protestors from the building,” said Modiba.
