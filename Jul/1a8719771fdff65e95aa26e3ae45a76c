PEOPLE often mistake her partner for her son. This is according to a woman who is 15 centimetres taller than her hubby. The woman says she’s tired of nasty comments from trolls. The Mirror reported that they don’t see eye-to-eye on a lot of things, but one thing the couple can definitely agree on is that size doesn’t matter in a relationship. READ: MY HUBBY BROKE ME! She says her friends and strangers have asked why she’s with someone so much shorter than her. “We’ve gotten comments asking if he’s my son or ‘if I need a real man’. I’m barely taller than average for a female. But some of the worst come from men who they think they’d be a better partner for me, telling me they could please me better or be what I need,” she said. The husband says everyone he’s ever dated has been much taller than him, so it’s never bothered him.
