COPS in Cape Town have arrested a man in connection with a shooting that happened two weeks ago. Three people were shot in the Site C area in Khayelitsha on Saturday, 16 July. The suspect made his first appearance in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 27 July. Police spokesman Andre Traut said detectives had a breakthrough on Monday, 25 July, when they bust a 30-year-old man. “The endeavours of our detectives to pursue every avenue to bring to book those responsible for violent crimes in this province were rewarded with the court appearance of a 30-year-old suspect this morning in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court. “The suspect, who was arrested on Monday evening during a tracing operation in Khayelitsha, has been charged with three counts of murder.
