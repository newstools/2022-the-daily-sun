MPUMALANGA police boss Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has sent a stern warning to traditional healers to fight for their calling. She said this during a meeting between cops, izangoma and pastors held at Gutshwa in KaBokweni. The warning comes after incidents of ritual killings emerged recently in the province. Manamela said registered izangoma should not allow fake ones to turn their work into something it was not. “We want to respect you as people who have a calling to heal, not to kill,” she said “If you hear that there is a sangoma who is doing this, just stand up and fight for your province. Stand up and fight for your calling. You must all pledge and say, ‘not in our name’. There are many of you who are doing a good thing. Many of you have a real calling but there are those who come in back doors and do all negative things,” she said. Gogo Dudu Ngobeni said they were willing to work with the cops and stop the people who were tarnishing their calling. “It is our duty to protect our calling. Those who are doing these heinous crimes must know that their era is ending,” she said.
