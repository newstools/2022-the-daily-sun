MOTORISTS who use the N2 and other routes in and around Empangeni and Richards Bay, KZN, were forced to find alternative routes to reach their destination as they woke up with trucks blocking roads linking the two towns. Trucks were parked in the main routes that lead to industrial areas, preventing workers from reaching their workplaces. It was not yet clear if this was part of the fuel national shutdown, but authorities indicated that trucks were taken from drivers by a group of angry violent men, who then parked them there. Some residents were forced to go back home as the traffic was starting to build up. Motorist Sthandiwe Ndlela (39) said when she was approaching the Melomed Hospital robot, she saw traffic and decided to turn back home. Another motorist, Ntuthuko Myeza (42), said he has been stuck in traffic from 6am, with no way to move forward or backwards because he was in the middle. UMhlathuze municipal spokesman Bongani Gina appealed to motorists to use alternative routes while authorities were trying to clear the road. “Please use the N2. Traffic will be diverted to that road, so it might get congested at a later stage. Allow for travel time,” said Gina. Captain Siyanda Shangase said police were working on hunting the group of people who blocked the road with trucks. “The group did this because they want to send a message that the petrol price is too much. Police managed to capture the number plates of the cars they were using to escape,” said Shangase.
