THE rape trial against Archbishop Stephen Zondo of Living Waters Ministries continued in North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane on Monday, 18 July. Before court proceedings started, it was ruled that the third witness’ matter would be heard in camera and in the presence of court officials, which included the defendant. People in the gallery and the media were excused until the third witness was done. Zondo faces nine counts of rape, one of indecent assault and one of defeating the ends of justice. The first witness was a 46-year-old woman who accused Zondo of raping her around 1981 in Sebokeng zone 3 in the Vaal, while the second witness was her 47-year-old brother. Zondo’s supporters chanted songs and danced outside the court. The Murendeni group also protested, demanding justice for the victims. National secretary of the church, Sello Molibeli, said they don’t oppose the application of the victim and the state as it is a medical condition issue. He said Zondo has been vindicated as he was tried by the court of public opinion. Murendeni leader Pitso Ramutubeli known as Mabochobocho said they were happy the trial has started. The trial is set to continue till 5 August.
