FOLLOWING the brutal killing of seven at Lismor farm in Kestell, Free State, Police have made a breakthrough. Two men aged 22 and 34 have been arrested after the police investigating team followed intelligence-driven information. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said in a statement, “The two were arrested on a road just outside Bohlokong Township. “Two firearms believed to have been stolen from the same farmhouse were also recovered with the possibility that one of the firearms could be the murder weapon.” Makhele added, “For now it can only be confirmed that the young man killed was 17-year-old and the six women’s ages range from 22 and 53.
