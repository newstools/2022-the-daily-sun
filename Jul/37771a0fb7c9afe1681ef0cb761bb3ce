A WINE heist has ended in tears for a couple. This after the police in Croatia arrested a couple suspected of stealing 45 bottles of wine worth €1,6 million (around R27 million) at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Spain last October. According to Foodandwine.com, the couple also made off with 10 bottles of Chateau d’Yquem dating from 1806 to 1901, and over 20 bottles of Romanée-Conti. Cops in Spain teamed up with various European countries to track down the duo following the brazen heist that made headlines in 2021. READ: Cash-in-transit heist ends in tears! In a statement, Spain national police detailed how the heist unfolded. Cops said the couple, in their 30s, visited the restaurant three times before carrying out the theft. It is reported that they took a tour in a wine cellar, then returned to their room before the man snuck back down to the cellar while the woman distracted staff by asking for more food. “After using a previously purloined master key to gain access, he emerged with three large rucksacks – one on his back and two in each hand – which held the bottles he had stashed. They were stuffed with hotel towels to protect the bottles,” cops said in a statement. The couple was tracked down this week, and the stolen wine was not recovered. Investigations are ongoing.
