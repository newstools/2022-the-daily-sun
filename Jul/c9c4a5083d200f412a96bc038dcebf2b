By MBALI DLUNGWANAAFTER Sthokozo Mpisane lost her mother in 2005, her gogo took over and made sure she grew up well, went to school and got educated. And to show appreciation to Gogo Bathini Danca, Sthokozo (28) from Oshabeni in Port Shepstone dedicated her second qualification, a BTech in Engineering (Electrical: Heavy Current), to her. Sthokozo was among the engineering graduates who were honoured at the Durban University of Technology’s graduation ceremony at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre on Monday, 11 July. She said the reason she let her gogo wear her graduation gown and hood was that in 2018, she completed her diploma and dedicated it to herself. She said when she was still in school, her gogo didn’t get a pension as she was still young and did not qualify for it. “My grandmother used to do piece jobs such as washing clothes and planting vegetables for people in order for her to get money. As I stayed in res and had NSFAS, she sent me some money to buy cosmetics,” she said. Sthokozo said her gogo encouraged her to finish her qualification so she could find a good job. “As much as there wasn’t a lot of money, her support and words of encouragement made me who I am today. “I pushed myself to get a second qualification for my gogo because my mother passed away when I was 11 years old. “My grandmother raised me through many hardships. It was not easy, but we are here today,” said Sthokozo. She thanked God for affording her the opportunity to obtain her BTech while her gogo was still alive and in good health. Gogo Bathini was happy and very proud of her hardworking granddaughter and could not hold back her tears when she heard Sthokozo’s name being called on stage. She wished Sthokozo’s mother was still alive to witness the incredible moment. “I’m confident that my granddaughter will soon find the job she desires,” she said. She encouraged Sthokozo not to give up and trust that her turn was coming.
