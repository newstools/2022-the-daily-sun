INITIATES have made a pledge to be good citizens who will protect women and children. The 2022 Ndebele initiates of the SoGutjhe Royal House in Phola Location in Mpumalanga signed a pledge against gender-based violence (GBV) and crime during their homecoming on Friday, 1 July. The royal house said they sent 74 initiates to the initiation school in April and all of them came back safe and healthy. The signing of the anti-GBV and anti-crime pledge was led by Ikosi Sipho Mahlangu. He said the royal house was pleased that there were no injuries reported and all initiates came back well and healthy.  He said the groundbreaking initiative was aimed at educating the initiates on the importance of protecting young girls and women in the face of the rising number of abductions. “Young men can play a crucial role in the fight against crime within their communities.” One of the initiates, Sibusiso “Msweswe”Mahlangu (25), said: “As we take this pledge, we vow to be the change that is needed in our community and show others that great men don’t abuse women but protect them.” ALSO READ |
