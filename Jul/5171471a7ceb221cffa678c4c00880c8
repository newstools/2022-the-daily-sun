PEOPLE love the steak kota at Food Corner. And Kearabetswe Mutle, owner of the Food Corner, said people come from far for their kota. Established in 2009 at Zone 2 in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane, Kearabetswe said he got consistent support every year. He said he realised that people were eating similar kotas and there was a gap in the market. “We are known for the steak kota. We always try to improve and add new things on the menu. But we keep it simple,” he said. Kearabetswe said his secret was keeping his kota fresh and tasty. He said the Covid-19 pandemic pushed them to deliver to their customers doorstep.

He has 20 workers and more job opportunities will be created in Mabopane. “My goal is to have shops in all nine provinces. I started small in a backroom in Ga-Rankuwa and after the first six months I saw the beauty of this business,” he said. Food Corner also sells steak, ribs, chicken, fish, wraps, pap and salads. A resident, Pule Mthimunye (34), said: “This kota is unique and delicious and I enjoy eating it.”
