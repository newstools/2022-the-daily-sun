MASOGANA have returned home after six weeks in the mountains in Mamelodi, Tshwane. A total of 70 boys graduated from an initiation school on Friday, 15 July. Chief Lemi Mavimbela Makhura of RDP in Extension 18, Mamelodi said the boys were also taught about gender-based violence in the mountains. “This is a custom our grandfathers practised and the ancestors are happy with it. “This is a huge process for them and it’s good for them to learn how things are done. “The good thing is that I received their family’s blessings,” he told Daily Sun. He said he had been running the initiation school for the past 11 years without any deaths, which made the parents trust him. Princess Patricia Mavimbela Makhura said this was a good moment for the young boys. “It’s important for people to follow their culture and know where they come from,” she told the People’s Paper. Parent Patricia Nkosi (47) said she was happy her 13-year-old son came back safe and healthy. “This is a good thing for our boys to know our culture which we wish the young generation can follow as well,” she said. She said she would not abandon her culture because it was important.
