Victims of the Mdlalose tavern shooting in Soweto were
remembered in an emotional memorial service on Thursday. Some family members of the deceased struggled to hold their
tears as they lined up to share their fond memories of their loved ones. They held framed photos of the deceased in front of scores
of residents who were in attendance at the memorial service held in a small
tent a stone throw away from Mdlalose’s tavern. Also at the memorial service, it was revealed that the
majority of those who have died, hail from Mzimkhulu, a small KZN town. Thobekile Thobela speaking on behalf of the Mngwenyama
family said, “We are hurt by the loss of Philani Mngwenyama (Kwasa). “As young people, we are asking that if we have sinned, God
please forgive. “Who is going to bury our parents when we die like this, we
die in places where we go to make ourselves happy.” “Kwasa fought, but failed. He made it out of the crime scene
where they were shot, but died in hospital." Thobela said the tavern was filled with people from
Mzimkhulu. She pleaded with the police that those who have carried out the
shooting must be brought to book. Mpumi Chirwa speaking on behalf of Daliwonga Mluma said,
"We still have questions, what have they done to be killed in that
manner." "Nomzamo has been crying for far too long, the question
I have is how many people have to die for the people of Nomazamo to be
heard?" “What we were asking from the government is that the
perpetrators must be caught before we can bury our brothers and sisters. The majority of those who have died will be buried in KZN.
Two families, for now, have announced that they will opt to bury their loved
ones in Gauteng.
