MUSIC fans will soon get an opportunity to see their favourite artists on the soccer pitch. Wits University in Joburg will be hosting a celebrity match on 24 July. Big Zulu, one of the organisers, said the event, which first took place last year, was coming back by popular demand. “This time around, we have added two more genres with a gqom team, captained by Tira, and an amapiano team, captained by Kabza De Small. “They will be joining the hip-hop and maskandi tams. “We had a wonderful game last year, and we will have the same players. The hip-hop team includes Kwesta, AKA, Sjava and Kid X,” said Big Zulu. However, he said some people in the entertainment industry were demanding that their genres also be added. “We have had calls from various sectors in the industry. However, we need to take it one step at a time.

Big Zulu said fans also wanted the match to be televised, and they were negotiating with the relevant people. “Last year, we had about 100 000 people streaming the match online. This showed a high level of interest from the public,” he said. Other artists taking part include Dladla Mshunqisi, Thokozani Langa, Mampintsha, DJ Cleo, Mfundo the DJ, and Young Stunna. Dladla Mshunqisi told Daily Sun he would be playing for the gqom team. “I’m their striker and I’ve already started getting fit for the games. I’m excited and I know people are doubting my dribbling skills, but I will prove them wrong,” he said. In the first match held in August last year, the maskandi team defeated the hip-hop team. Tickets are already available at R150 for general and R300 for VIP at Computicket.
