YOUNG scientist Kutlwano Tshatiwa has scooped the gold medal at the International Festival of Engineering Science. The teenager from Madikwe, outside Rustenburg in North West, represented South Africa at the festival held in Tunisia recently. He developed a cellphone app that can assist with medical diagnosis by processing X-ray images. The app can also help determine if a person is suffering from pneumonia or skin cancer. The 17-year-old said he had been interested in computers since he was 13. His passion for software has already won him over 10 computer science prizes. “I worked very hard and I am happy that I made myself and everyone proud. “Tunisia was a great experience. The competition was tough but winning a gold medal among very talented young scientists from all over the world made me feel proud,” he said. “I want to make the app more productive in order to generate income and possibly open my own company and hire other people.” Kutlwano’s mother Tebogo said he had always been a big dreamer. “I am very proud of what he has done for himself.” Bojanala Platinum Mayor Matlakala Nondzaba said the municipality was extremely proud and was committed to helping Kutlwano achieve more. “We will assist him to register the app in his name,” she said. The mayor said the municipality would also ask Kutlwano to create an app. North West Premier Bushy Maape said Kutlwano had made the province proud.
