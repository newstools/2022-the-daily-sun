SINIKEZIWE Ndlovu’s family laid her to rest with heavy hearts on Sunday, 10 July. The seven-year-old died in Leratong Hospital on 27 June, weeks after she was run over at the premises of Hector Peterson Primary School in Dobsonville, Soweto. The sad family said they would continue questioning the education department until they got all the answers. Uncle Richard (47) told Daily Sun the incident happened on 17 May and the family was still traumatised by the little girl’s horrific injuries. He said doctors told them she would never have a normal life if she survived. Mum Gcinile (43) described her daughter as a loving, beautiful and respectful child. She said Sinikeziwe was a blessing and she felt like she had been robbed. “I feel empty. I don’t know what else to say or how I will go on living without her presence in my life,” she said. Thabang Ramogaswe of the Joburg West Department of Education sent heartfelt condolences to the family. He said the department was very sorry for what happened. “Our hearts are with the family and we pray God strengthens them,” he said. Resident Puleng Motaung said the community had lost a beautiful soul. “I’m encouraging the family to take legal action against the school. We can’t let it go.” Neighbour Thabo Kekana said the community would not rest until there was justice for Sinikeziwe.
