SCRAPYARD boss Themba Letswele was horrified when he arrived at his premises to be greeted by the body of his security guard lying in a pool of blood. The traumatised business owner found his 46-year-old guard lying dead at Arlindo’s Scrapyard in Acornhoek, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on Saturday, 30 July at about 11.30pm. Themba said after returning home from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, he phoned the guard, who is originally from Lesotho, but he didn’t answer. “This was pure murder as nothing was taken. “I became suspicious when I phoned him and he didn’t answer,” he said. “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw something lying on the ground. When I drew closer, I saw him lying in a pool of blood. He had multiple gunshot wounds. “I don’t know what happened as he was guarding the premises with more than six dogs.” Themba said he immediately called the police. They arrived with paramedics, who declared him dead. “Some people are after me. They want to destroy my name and my business,” said Themba. At the time of going to print, cops had not responded to Daily Sun’s request for comment.
