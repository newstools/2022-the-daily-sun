KGOSHI Edwin Malele was hijacked and robbed by three gunmen during a shop robbery on Saturday, 23 July. The Kgoshi of the Malele Tribal Council outside Dwarsloop near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, had just parked his Toyota Hilux GD6 2.4 bakkie outside a shop. A gang appeared and held him and a shop assistant at gun point. “I had just finished speaking to the shop assistant. When she left to open the shop’s office, a gang of three armed tsotsis appeared out of nowhere and grabbed her. “They came back and threatened to blow our brains out and forced us to lie down,” said Malele. They took car keys, bank cards, cellphones and cash from the shop assistant. I had to give them my PINs as they threatened to come back and finish me off if the bank transactions failed.” He said they locked them in the office and they broke the window and alerted people outside. Kgoshi Mathibela Mokoena, who’s the Mpumalanga House of Traditional Leaders chairman and also Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa president, said they condemned the barbaric act. “Fortunately, he was not hurt. We hope the police will do their best to bring the perpetrators to book,” said Mokoena. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said the police are investigating a carjacking case and the robbery of Malele’s Hilux double cab with registration number KBF 625 MP. He said an Apple iPhone, Promax iPhone and bank cards were taken. “According to the information, the three armed men were wearing camouflage uniforms resembling the state military in Saselani Trust. So far no one has been arrested,” he said. Anyone with information can call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or send information via the MYSAPSAPP.
