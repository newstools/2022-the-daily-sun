MEMBERS of St Paul Apostolic Faith Mission International will not be going to church on Sunday. The Red Ants destroyed the church on Monday, 11 July, in Mohlakeng, west of Joburg. Angry members told Daily Sun they heard rumours the church was destroyed to make space for a children’s play park or an alcohol outlet. Members said they were not occupying the land unlawfully and were engaging with the municipality to take ownership. The SunTeam was given a letter from the councillor, dated April 2021, addressed to the infrastructure, development and planning department requesting permission for the church to occupy it. “They maintain the stand by keeping it clean and due to growing numbers, they need to expand,” it read. Pastor Oupaki Molefe said: “We have been in talks with the municipality since we occupied the land to be granted ownership. The delay was from their side.” ALSO READ: Presidency: Teffo’s claims baseless! Molefe said it cost R50 000 to build the church. He said all window frames and building materials were destroyed. Dibate Molefe said: “The church has done a lot for the community, like distributing food parcels and creating jobs.” Letta Motsau said: “The land was vacant for a long time. It used to be a hiding spot for criminals. When the church took over, we had peace of mind.” City spokesman Godfrey Moutloa said the church occupied the land illegally and the municipality tried to evict it on numerous occasions. “Efforts to have them removed failed. We have had numerous engagements with them,” he said. Moutloa said there was a letter from the councillor but they occupied the land before the process was completed.
