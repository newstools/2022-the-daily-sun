Funeral arrangements of Khayalethu Magadla are to be
announced once his post-mortem is completed. The body of Khayalethu was found on Saturday, 2 July, after
missing for three weeks. Khayalethu's family is reportedly relieved to have found his
body. The family said the recovery of his body has brought closure
and thanked the rescue team for their hard work. The 6-year-old fell into a manhole while playing with
friends in Dlamini, Soweto. He was found from the splitter chamber on the first manhole
towards the samp situated near the Eldorado Cemetery, the Joburg Emergency
Services said. The urban search and rescue teams have covered at least 20km
from Dlamini to Eldorado Park. Last week the community of Soweto held a candlelight
ceremony, praying for Khayalethu's body to be recovered.
