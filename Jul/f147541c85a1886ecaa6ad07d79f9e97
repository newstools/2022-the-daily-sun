NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has written to deputy president David Mabuza, asking that Parliament be kept abreast of interventions into the energy crisis. Parliament spokesman Moloto Mothapo said Mapisa-Nqakula had received letters from the Democratic Alliance, Economic Freedom Fighters and United Democratic Movement, requesting that she call back the house from the constituency period to debate and find solutions to the energy crisis and increase in petrol prices. He said this was done despite the National Assembly having already had two debates, in March and May, on the impact of the energy crisis on citizens and businesses. “The speaker has, in view of the detrimental impact this crisis is having on the country and the economy, and consistent with Parliament’s constitutionally-mandated oversight role, requested that the National Assembly be kept abreast of any programmes or interventions the executive puts in place to deal with the energy crisis,” said Mothapo. He said the Speaker raised concerns that power outages caused untold hardships on citizens and struggling businesses. “The speaker has also written to the house chairman for committees, oversight and ICT Cedric Frolick, requesting that the assembly’s oversight committees prioritise all matters of national concern, including oversight on load shedding and petrol price increases and report to the house,” he said.
