SHE has been living with the father of her nine kids in peace for 23 years. But her husband (52) sadly died in 2019 and now her in-laws want her out of the family house. In the early hours of Friday 15 July, two armed izinkabi went to the house and tried to open the door with a bunch of keys. Luckily, the woman heard them and screamed for help. The two men hurried out of the yard when they heard her scream, but left a note which read: “If you don’t move.” The note has since been taken by the police. The woman (44) from Diepkloof in Soweto said she wasn’t sure if her in-laws were behind the incident. “I’m worried about the safety of my children,” she said. She said after her husband died, there was an agreement with her in-laws that she could live in the house until the kids, aged between seven and 16, were older. But this year, she was told to move out. “The community asked them to allow me to stay until December because my children are attending school this side,” she said. But she told Daily Sun she wasn’t sure who could have sent izinkabi. The woman said on that night, she felt the urge to wake up and suddenly heard someone try to open the front door. She said she quietly got up to peep through the window and saw two men wearing black. “They were armed and one of them moved to the window to try to open it as they were struggling to open the door,” she said. She said she screamed for help and the men got into a black car and sped off. “I’m not refusing to move. I just want a place to live with all my children,” she said. Captain Phephi Matlou of Diepkloof cop shop confirmed that a case of intimidation has been opened.
