And its producer Thabo Boom said people should expect a lot to happen in the second season. “People are going to pay for their sins. And, there will be a wedding and new characters will be joining. Some new and known faces will be coming onto the show,” he said. The youngest actress of the cast, Karabo Magongwa (14), said being in the presence of big stars like Vusi Kunene and Winnie Ntshaba was a great experience. “Acting alongside these actors has been amazing. Even though they are big stars, that didn’t feel like it to me because they feel like my second family. They are humble,” she said. Season two starts on Monday, 18 July.
