THEY are saying, “no to alcohol at our schools”. These are the words of pupils, residents, concerned parents and members of the World Changers Candidates organisation. Pupils from Leondale High School in Germiston, famously known as the “dagga school”, are strongly opposing the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill, which will see alcohol being sold at schools during school functions, if approved. World Changers Candidates’ Lucas Mahlakgane said this is the message contained in their petition, which will be launched by the Leondale high pupils as part of their school readiness campaign when the schools reopen on Tuesday, 19 July. He said pupils believe that the government’s pronouncement on dagga being legalised has largely contributed to the enactment of the infamous dagga party on 20 April, and they’e worried that the bill will lead to substance abuse in schools. He said that the campaign and petition, which are supported by the school governing body, parents and pupils, will be launched on 19 July as part of the school’s special assembly. They’e hoping to collect about 2 000 signatures, 1 700 of which are of registered pupils at the school. Pupils Katlego Mabena and Nceba Ngwenya, who have become drug activists since the controversial dagga party video went viral, will lead the campaign. They’ll share evidence-based drug abuse prevention programmes, which the school adopted following the incident.
