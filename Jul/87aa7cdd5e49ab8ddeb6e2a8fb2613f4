TWO people have been arrested in connection with a cryptocurrency investment scam in which a victim allegedly lost more than R30 million. Zain Muhammed Valle (57) and Michelle Bianca Bezuidenhout (25) appeared in the Lenasia Regional Court in Joburg on Tuesday, 5 July. They joined Bezuidenhout’s husband and co-accused Jarrod de Lange (32) in the dock. He was arrested De Lange in 2020. Valle and Bezuidenhout have been charged with fraud and money laundering following their arrest by the Hawks at their residences in Lenasia and Alberton. “Their arrest emanated from an alleged cryptocurrency establishment scam in which the complainant was lured to invest in Siyakhula Logistics in February 2020, with potential lucrative dividends,” said Hawks spokesman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu. “The complainant allegedly transferred about R34 million into the establishment and Bezuidenhout’s bank accounts in different transactions,” said Mulamu. The complainant agreed to enter into a partnership in the cryptocurrency business “but the money was used for Liverage Trading company without their consent”, said Mulamu. Valle and Bezuidenhout were granted R10 000 bail each, while De Lange was released on R20 000 bail. The case was postponed to 19 July for legal representations. X NEWS24
