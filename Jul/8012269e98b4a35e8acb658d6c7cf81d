 INKOSI Mwelo Nonkonyana has taken the decision to elect new Eastern Cape House
of Traditional Leaders chairman to court. This week, Nonkonyana filed papers in the Bhisho High Court. He wants the court to set aside the election presided over by MEC Xolile Nqatha
and Nkosi Langa Mavuso - because there is an interdict from the  high
court restraining them from doing so. He said the interdict was granted on 10 August 2020, pending finalisation of
his application to quash his removal as the chairman on 31 July 2020. “All the legal steps that I have taken are necessary to clear my name and
protect the struggle of traditional leaders of South Africa to be a part of
governance at all spheres of government," said Nonkonyana. He said he was accused of having contravened Covid-19 regulations, being
divisive and practising full-time as an advocate, while also serving as
chairman of the House. "These allegations are baseless as I closed my practice in 2017, the same
year I became chairman of the House," Nonkonyana said. He claimed he was denied his constitutional right to fair administrative action
before the decision was taken by the House. The matter is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday, 5 July.
