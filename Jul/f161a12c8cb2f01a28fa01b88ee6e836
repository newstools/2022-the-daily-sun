FORMER Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs winger Jerry Sadike has sadly passed away. Sadike was found missing from his home in Orlando last week Monday. He suffered a stroke earlier this year and was under medication. Because he was nowhere to be found, the family opened the case to the police station of the missing person. They were appealing to people who have information to inform the police. However, he was found dead at the Edenvale hospital on Thursday morning, having passed away this past Monday. “He found him and he’s no more,” said Palesa Zwane, who said Sadike is her uncle. “It is like a dream and it is unbelievable. We are now just taking one day as it comes.” According to Zwane, Sadike was someone who stayed around a yard, inside the house since he’s on chronic medication. But when he left for the first time last Monday, he came back. But when he left for the second time around 1:45pm, they thought he would come back with concern because he doesn’t go out normally. Then the day ended and he didn’t come back. This after he had not taken his medication, leading to panic in his family. “We went to the ward first and we didn’t just go straight to the mortuary, we went to the ward for the missing person,” she added. “Not finding him in the ward, we then went to the mortuary after we were told there’s one person that actually came last week Tuesday who was registered as an unknown. They (the people at the hospital) indicated to us that it is someone who has a history of a stroke. When we got there, we actually had to confirm the body and we found that it was actually him.” Sadike, who also played for Pimville United Brothers, joined Chiefs in 1973. He holds a significant history in Soweto Derby to have played both for Chiefs and Pirates. He is one six players to have scored for both clubs in a derby match, with others being Gabriel Khoza‚ Blessing Mgidi‚ Donald ‘Ace’ Khuse‚ Marks Maponyane and Marc Bachelor.
