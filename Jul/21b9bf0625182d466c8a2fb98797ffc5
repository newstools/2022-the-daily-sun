PASTORS usually preach that people shouldn’t steal. But this time, a man of cloth was found on the wrong side of the law. Founder of In His Presence Ministries Church, Pastor Walter Mashalane, also known as Major1’s son, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for theft of firearms. The 46-year-old was sentenced by the Senwabarwana Regional Court in Limpopo on Friday, 15 July. According to Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, Mashalane was sentenced for firearm theft, possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition. He said the court found the accused had approached one of his congregants and requested she brings two firearms belonging to her husband to pray for them, claiming he had negative premonitions about them in 2019. The woman then handed the firearms to Mashalane without the knowledge of the lawful owner. Mojapelo said: “Afterwards, the lawful owner approached the pastor and asked him to hand them back but he refused.” He said a case of theft of firearms was subsequently opened and later transferred to provincial detectives for investigation. The case was assigned to Sergeant Noko Mashitisho for further investigation. Mashitisho, assisted by the provincial tracking team, arrested the pastor on 10 September 2019 at Mokhuromela Village. “Police found one firearm with ammunition concealed inside a ceiling after a thorough probe of the house. “The other firearm was never recovered. The accused was later granted free bail with a warning until his five-year imprisonment on the said day and also declared unfit to possess a firearm,” he said. Limpopo police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe applauded the positive outcome of the court proceedings in jailing Mashalane. “This should serve as a deterrence to other pastors that no one is above the law. Pastors are supposed to provide spiritual guidance to society, not to be involved in criminal activities,” she said.
