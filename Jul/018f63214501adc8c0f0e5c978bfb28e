ACCUSED number one in the Hillary Gardee murder case pointed cops to where the shooting occurred. This was revealed by investigating officer Colonel Thamsanqa Mkhaliphi during the bail hearing of Sipho Mkhatshwa in the Nelspruit Magistrates Court, Mpumalanga, on Tuesday 26 July. Mkhaliphi said at the scene, police found stains that appeared to be blood in a house and a vehicle. “The applicant is the only accused who stated exactly where Hillary Gardee was shot on the body, on the exact spot where the postmortem results show,” he said. Mkhaliphi told the court the state was opposing bail because Mkhatshwa might flee as he had relatives outside the country and could threaten witnesses. Early in July, the state added a charge of conspiracy to commit murder to his sheet. Mkhaliphi said the charge came after the three men accused of the murder conspired to kill one of the witnesses while in the holding cells together. “Another witness overheard the applicant talking about eliminating one of the witnesses,” he said. The matter was postponed to Friday 29 July for bail arguments.
