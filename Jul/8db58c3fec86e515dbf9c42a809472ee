WORKING horses need shoes so they don’t slip on the road. However, the hooves of most kasi horses are not being taken care of and concerned residents say scrap metal collectors are so obsessed with making money that they neglect their animals. Scrap metal collectors in the kasi often use horses to transport metal and sell coal. A horse being used to draw a cart collapsed on the tar road in Diepkloof, Soweto, on Friday 8 July, almost causing an accident. A resident told Daily Sun: “These animals are abused and owners don’t bother to buy them shoes. We want to know what the law says to protect the animals and motorists, as they’re used on busy roads.” A witness of the incident on the busy road said it almost caused a huge accident. “The animal could be injured and then they just make it get up and continue with the trip, which is unfair,” said the resident. The SunTeam spoke to the horse’s owners, who said they were struggling to feed their families and couldn’t afford horse shoes. But residents who saw the incident said this was not an excuse. “Why keep animals and not look after them?” asked a resident. Jerry Selloane of Soweto Animal Rescue and Advisory Centre said working horses experienced too much abuse ekasi. “We appeal to the residents to help us identify the horse so it can get medical treatment.” He said the collapse of the horses could have been caused by exhaustion and hunger. In some cases, the hooves might have been left to overgrow and not groomed, resulting in the animal struggling to walk and eventually collapsing. “Horses need to have their hooves groomed and have shoes afterwards, but those who use them ekasi don’t care and are only obsessed with making money.”
