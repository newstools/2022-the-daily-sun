A TAVERN worker arrived at work to find his boss and his assistant’s bodies lying naked in a pool of blood. A murder case was opened following the gruesome discovery of the bodies of Matimba Mashele (40) and Cristo Makhushe (20) in Croquetlawn, outside Mkhuhlu in Mpumalanga, on the morning of Saturday 2 June but the killers seem to have vanished into thin air. Matimba’s shocked sister, Tsakani Ubisi (43), said he had multiple bullet wounds to his head, while Cristo was shot in the chest. “His gun and cash as well as the hard drive of the CCTV camera were missing,” she said. “It’s clear this was a well-planned attack by their killers.” Tsakani said her brother, a former South African National Defence Force intelligence captain, is survived by his wife and two kids. She described him as a humble man. A neighbour said they heard gunshots shortly after the tavern closed at about 9pm on Friday night. “We were suspicious after hearing the shots and the next morning we went to check, but there were no signs of wrongdoing,” said the resident. “The tavern was closed and the bakkie was parked outside.” Terrified residents called on Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela and Mpumalanga Community Safety, Security and Liaison MEC Vusi Shongwe to urgently intervene. “We are no longer safe. The gunmen do as they wish. “They attack us inside our houses,” said a resident. “We have lost a number of people after being attacked in their houses. “Two weeks ago, two villagers were gunned down while sleeping in their houses.” Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said investigations were underway and no arrests have been made yet. Anyone with information should contact the Calcutta police on 013 799 5600 or Lieutenant-Colonel Dudu Shabangu on 082 469 2569.
