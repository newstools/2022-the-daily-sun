WHILE partygoers were enjoying themselves at a local tavern in Mamelodi, Tshwane, thugs pounced on them, shooting and killing one man. Police are looking for three suspects after the incident. Police spokeswoman Captain Augustinah Selepe said the police had launched a manhunt after a 33-year-old man was shot dead at Monaco tavern in the early hours of Monday, 11 July, around 1am. “Police received information about the shooting incident and found the victim lying down after being shot on the head twice,” she said. Selepe said it was alleged three unknown armed suspects, wearing balaclavas, arrived and found people at the tavern. “They fired shots in the air and people dispersed. Then they approached the deceased and shot him in the head.” No other people were shot during the incident. “The motive is unknown and the police are investigating a case of murder,” said Selepe, urging anyone with information to contact CrimeStop at 08600 10111 or go to their nearest police station.
