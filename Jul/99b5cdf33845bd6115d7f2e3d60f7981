HLENGIWE Kubheka died trying to get food for her family. The unemployed 23-year-old from Nkundusi Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, drowned when the boat she was in capsized after it was attacked by a hippo, on Sunday night, 17 July. Hlengiwe was apparently fishing with a man, believed to be her boyfriend, who managed to swim out and save his own life. Her body was recovered by the police on Monday, 18 July. The man (boyfriend) has since disappeared and residents believe he fled because he feared he would be blamed for Hlengiwe’s death. Councillor Siyabonga Mkhumbuzi, who visited the family, said everyone was devastated and it was sad that she died trying to get something to eat. “The high unemployment rate is the biggest enemy facing the youth. The dam is dangerous because it has hippos, but we can’t tell people to stop fishing as it’s their only source of food and income,” he said. “In order for me to tell them to stop fishing in the dam, I must bring them job opportunities. I’m engaging different stakeholders to try and find a long-term solution.” He appealed to residents to be careful and look out for hippos when fishing. Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquest docket was being investigated by the Mtubatuba police. “The body of a woman was found and the matter is still under investigation,” said Gwala. The SunTeam tried to contact Hlengiwe’s mother several times, but the phone went straight to voicemail.
