RADIO presenter Jacinta Ngobese has accused the office of KZN premier of stealing her concept. She said she submitted a proposal to the office asking for funding for her event, We are One Festival. The aim of the festival was to unite the INK community, which include Phoenix, KwaMashu, Newlands, Inanda, Ntuzuma and other local locations. “Racial tensions among these communities are well documented so I introduced the concept as a way of uniting them,” she said. Jacinta said she wanted to host the festival annually. ALSO READ : Portia Modise eats humble pie! “In 2016, I launched and hosted the first festival at KwaMashu, Bridge City. It was a huge success. However, I couldn’t get funding for the following years. I approached the government of KZN, requesting funding to revive the festival. I never received the funding. Instead, I saw the premier, Sihle Zikalala, using my concept. Jacinta said she was still deciding whether to sue Zikalala’s office or not. Spokesman for Zikalala’s office, Lennox Mabaso, said he received Jacinta’s proposal. “The premier has no knowledge of this and he never used Jacinta’s concept. “But if Jacinta has proof of this, she can report me to my principals and I’ll gladly resign,” he said.
