THE sewer pipes in Philippi along Link Road were replaced barely two years ago, but kak is back on the streets again. Gatvol residents said they’ve been living with kak on the main road for the past month and they do not know why the sewage didn’t stop even when the pipes were replaced. “Two years ago, the road was closed because they were fixing it while they were replacing the pipes. Now we have the very same problem we had two years ago. We are sick and tired of this,” said resident Nomathemba Vukubi (45). Some residents said they were worried that their kids would suffer from illnesses caused by the kak water.

The MMC for water and sanitation, Councillor Zahid Badroodien, said vandalism was the cause of the problem. “The city’s new lockable manhole covers have been vandalised and these manholes have been used to dump debris. The city’s water and sanitation directorate currently has a maintenance team that is cleaning the Link Road sewer line and removing the debris. Phase one of the sewer pipeline rehabilitation project was completed three months ago,” she said. The City of Cape Town has urged residents to report vandalism and people would be rewarded R5 000 for the information.
