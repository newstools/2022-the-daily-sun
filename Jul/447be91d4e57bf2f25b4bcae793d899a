THE church is a place of safety for most people but for thugs, it’s another heist job. A New York pastor was robbed during a live-streamed service on Sunday, 24 July after gunmen stormed into the church. According to CNN, Bishop Lamor Miller-Whitehead and his wife were robbed of jewellery worth $1 million (about R16 million). It’s reported that three armed men entered the Leaders of Tomorrow church and made off with the jewellery which the pastor and his wife were wearing. A video of the robbery has since been shared by various news outlets in the United States and the thugs wearing masks were caught on camera.

CNN reported that the flashy pastor later told WCBS what happened. “I got women and children there. As I got down, one went to my wife and took all her jewellery, and had the gun in front of my eight-month-old baby’s face. “Took off my bishop’s ring, my wedding band and took off my bishop chain,” said Whitehead. He said one of the thugs tapped on his neck to check if he had anything else left and suggested that the robbers knew that he had other jewellery. Cops said the gunmen left the church on foot and then drove off in a white Mercedes-Benz. Investigations into the robbery are continuing.
