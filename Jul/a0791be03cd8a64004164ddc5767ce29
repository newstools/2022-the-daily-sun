TWO suspects were arrested on Tuesday, 5 July, after they allegedly attempted to rob an employee of a petrol station, who was trying to deposit money at an ATM in Jan Kempdorp, Northern Cape. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Sergio Kock, the suspects allegedly threatened the victim with a revolver and a knife and demanded the bag of money. “Community members witnessed the incident and started to chase after the robbers who fired two gunshots in retaliation. The citizens apprehended the suspects and contacted the police for assistance in detaining the suspects,” Kock said. He said cops also confiscated the weapons and charged the suspects with armed robbery. The acting deputy provincial commissioner for crime detection, Brigadier Nicky Mills, urged community members to be vigilant and alert when conducting such actions, especially at ATMs. “The police are ready to serve and protect and no person should put his or her life at risk,” Mills said.
