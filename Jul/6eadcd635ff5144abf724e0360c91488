AN inconsolable mother fainted when 19 coffins arrived at Scenery Park Sports Field for a mass funeral service. The service was in memory of the 21 teenagers who perished from a yet-to-be-determined cause at Enyobeni Tavern in East London, Eastern Cape, on 26 June. And heartbroken mum Siyolise’s 18-year-old daughter, Sandanathi Mahlakahlaka, was among the victims. President Cyril Ramaphosa and Premier Oscar Mabuyane were among mourners at the park.
