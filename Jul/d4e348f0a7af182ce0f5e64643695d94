A MLUNGU phara has been scaring kasi residents. According to residents of Diepkloof in Soweto, the woman has been knocking on their doors and giving the impression that she’s homeless and needs urgent help, only to rob Good Samaritans. Lindelwa Mnguni (31) said the woman was at her home on 6 July, but luckily, her gogo picked up that something was off. “She came in, asked for food and while my grandmother was making her food, she started walking around as if she was looking for something.” When the gogo asked the woman if she also needed water, she noticed that she was fishing around for valuables and chased her away. Scelo Mabena (37) said the woman went to his home on Saturday, 9 July asking for a plate of food. He said he let the woman in and left her to make food. When he came back, she had disappeared. “I got annoyed with myself because I heard about this, but I thought it was just a joke or a rumour,” he said. Mpho Nsibande (39) said he first saw the woman at the tavern on Saturday and then she knocked on his door on Monday, 11 July. “She told me her husband chased her out of their home and she needed a place to sleep. I immediately chased her away,” he said. Residents said they often saw the woman roaming around Diepkloof with a bottle of beer in her hand. Diepkloof police spokesman, Captain Phephi Matlou, said he was not aware of the allegations and urged residents to report it if they got robbed or fell victim to any other criminal activities.
