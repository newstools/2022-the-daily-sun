ON SATURDAY, 30 July, Mzansi was hit by yet another mass shooting. Less than a month after 12 people were gunned down at a tavern in Sweetwaters, Pietermaritzburg, seven people were shot at the Siqhopholozi Tuck Shop in Mariannhill, eThekwini. Following the shocking incident, the KZN police have mobilised all resources at their disposal to hunt down those responsible. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said it was reported that just after 7pm, a group of unknown men opened fire at the spaza shop, killing six men, aged between 30 and 65. One other man was rushed to hospital with gunshot wounds where he later died. “Initial investigations revealed that three of the deceased were the tuck shop owner as well as his two sons. One of the deceased was a traditional healer, who might have been the actual target of the hit.” KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said: “The incident once again demonstrated our concern that firearms are contributing to the high levels of crime in the province and we are advocating for stricter laws regarding the management of legal firearms, as many of them end up being used by criminals,” he said.
