FOR Apostle Moosa Mohlala, his church is not only about praying, but a place where congregants can meet a romantic partner. The Cape-Town based pastor asks unmarried women to come forward and for unmarried men to pick the woman of their choice. In a video circulating on social media, the mfundisi is seen standing on the pulpit and calling a man to make his choice. “Biza, iza ngapha hamba uyokhethe umfazi (Biza, come here and go chose your woman/wife).” Mohlala confirmed to Daily Sun the video was taken last Sunday during a special service of amadaki. “We do that only once per year since two years ago. We make it easy for men who are afraid to approach women, we crack the ice for them,” said Mohlala. He said on the day of amadaki service, the married and unmarried dress up in traditional Xhosa marriage regalia called amadaki. The unmarried stand in front, where men would then make their choice. Mohlala asks women to buy amadaki for themselves and wear it during the service. He told Daily Sun this is not done for umjolo, but to build families. “People are happily married and engaged because of this.” Nosipho Sibani (45) said she was in a relationship with her then boyfriend, now her husband, but he was reluctant to marry her. She said when Mohlala announced the special service, she believed it would change his mind. “He announced it and asked single women to buy amadaki. I didn’t have money and had to wear my mum’s daki. God did wonders. A few months down the line I was married and we are happily married,” said Nosipho. Yonela Mzanywa (23), who also met her partner through the service, said: “It’s a good way to get people to stick to one partner instead of moving from one relationship to another. What Apostle Mohlala is doing is working towards that. People will be accountable for their actions and children will be raised in family structures. Many people are supporting the vision,” said Yonela.
