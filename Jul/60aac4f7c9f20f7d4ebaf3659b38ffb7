AMAZULU FC veteran striker, Lehlohonolo Majoro, hopes to play a big role for the club this coming season after he was troubled by an injury towards the end of last term. Majoro only played two of the seven matches under new coach Brandon Truter last season before missing the rest of the campaign due to an injury. Now the 35-year-old Majoro is fit and ready to go again, but he hopes to be injury free this season as this could be his last season with Usuthu. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates striker’s contract will expire at the end of this coming season. If he has aspirations to see it renewed, being injury free and scoring goals is what’s required, as club boss Sandile Zungu has made it clear that he wants a trophy and a top three finish. “I’m looking forward to giving my all in order to win silverware this season. “To see the club finish in a respectable position is part of my wish,” Majoro told SunSport. Majoro, under coach Benni McCarthy in the 2020-21 season, was the main man in seeing the club finish second in the DStv Premiership, ending the season as the club’s top scorer with nine goals in all competitions. Majoro was relieved that AmaZulu did not release him at the end of last season after Zungu surprisingly decided to release Luvuyo Memela and Augustine Mulenga. These players, just like Majoro, were key players in McCarthy’s side. But despite that, Zungu felt it was time to let them go, saying this team needed to be refreshed. “Each and every contract is a blessing. Each and every job that you have is a blessing, so I’m grateful,” added Majoro. “Whenever you are given an opportunity, you just have to showcase why you are given the job. That has been my motto throughout my career.”
