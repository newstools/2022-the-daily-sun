ONE of the three horrific accidents that happened on KZN roads over the weekend claimed four family members of deputy minister of transport Sindisiwe Chikunga. The deputy minister lost her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren in a head-on collision on the N11 outside Ladysmith on Sunday, 17 July. According to the statement by her department, Chikunga was expected to arrive in KZN today to identify the remains of the family and establish facts. “Further details about the accident will be released once full information is established from local authorities. The family is pleading for space and privacy before further communication with the public,” read the statement.
