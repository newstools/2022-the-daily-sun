THEIR yards are always wet and these residents suspect the problem is caused by a leaking water reservoir. Residents of Ga-Rankuwa zone 1 said they need the Tshwane Municipality to fix the problem so they can sleep without fearing their houses will fall down on them. Resident Peter Seshegoane told Daily Sun: “We are worried because if it bursts while we are away at work, it will be a huge problem. “We are hoping the municipality will identify the problem.” Violet Mekgwe said they had noticed that the municipal maintenance team had been frequenting the area and they hoped a solution was coming. “This matter is very urgent. We will witness a disaster if the reservoir bursts. We are worried our houses will fall because the water never dries up, no matter how hot the sun is,” she said. Municipal spokesman Sipho Stuurman said he was aware of the problems at the Ga-Rankuwa reservoir and the municipality was working to address them. He said officials recently conducted an oversight visit. “The crack that has been discovered is located high up in the reservoir and we suspect that it was caused by vandalism. The city has been using automated flow control equipment to manage the reservoir and keep the water level below the crack to prevent leaks, however, that equipment was stolen,” he said. Stuurman said the reservoir required repairs and the municipality was in the process of hiring structural engineers to assess the damage. “The reservoir is now being managed manually,” he said.
