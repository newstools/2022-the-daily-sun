SAM Mbatha’s family say they hope his murder case will be resolved soon. This comes after the case against his alleged killers was moved to the high court. The LGBTQI+ community activist and socialite’s uncle, Cornelius (60), said the brutal murder had taken a toll on the family. “It is emotionally draining for us but we are prepared to wait because we want the matter to be thoroughly investigated,” he said. Four suspects, aged between 19 and 22, were arrested after Sam’s body was found in the boot of a burnt out Hyundai i20 at a soccer field in Ikageng section in Klipgat, North West, in January 2021. Police investigations led them to a house in Phutha section and on 21 June 2021, the house was searched. Bloodstains were found on the floor, the bed and the carpet. An axe was found on the roof. DNA samples positively identified the body found inside the Hyundai as Sam’s. The National Prosecuting Authority’s North West spokesman, Henry Mamothame, said the Ga-Rankuwa Regional Court deferred the case against the four suspects to 29 August. He said they would appear in the high court’s North West division, sitting in the Ga-Rankuwa Regional Court. He said the state had provided the defence attorneys with the indictment, detailing all the charges relating to the murder and that a pre-trial conference date would be decided when the matter appeared. Meanwhile, accused Junior Modise (21) is out on free bail and was warned to be present at all court appearances, while the other accused Thato Mosetlha (22) was denied bail on 7 July. The other two accused, Arthur Khoza (19) and Mahlatsi Nkuna (21), are still out on R500 bail.
