A MUM won’t stop until she gets justice for her daughter, who was gang raped. The 43-year-old from Kagiso, Mogale City, told Daily Sun she had been having sleepless nights since her daughter (16) was raped by two men on her way home from extra classes at school on Monday 4 July. The mum said the grade 10 girl was dragged into the bush and raped. “When I came home at about 5pm, I found my daughter crying and shaking,” she said. The mum said what made the situation even more sad was that her daughter didn’t have faith in the justice system. “When I suggested we go open a case, she said there was no point as she had never seen those guys before and the police would take time finding them,” she said. The mum said although she understood her daughter’s feelings, she didn’t believe they should let it go. She said her daughter would feel better if the men were arrested and she knew they wouldn’t rape anyone else. The mum said she went to the police station on Thursday, 7 July but had not received a case number. She claimed the police told her to bring her daughter in to make a statement. “I told them that my daughter wasn’t in a state to speak, but it seems like this will affect the case. I’m starting to doubt they ever opened a case,” she said. The mum said she was also sexually assaulted when she was a teenager. “No one helped me, not even my family members. I know what this feels like and I want my daughter to know I will keep fighting for her, no matter what,” she told the People’s Paper. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo advised the mum to go back to the police station and talk to the station commander so she could be assisted.
