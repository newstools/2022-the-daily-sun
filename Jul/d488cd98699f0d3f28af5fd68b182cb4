  THE police in Waterval outside Louis Trichardt,
Limpopo, have opened an inquest docket following an incident of apparent misuse
of alcohol that took place at a local liquor outlet in Mashamba Village. Spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said patrons at
the alleged outlet allegedly participated in what they called a drinking competition,
where the winner, who could drink a whole bottle of Jagermeister in a specified
time, would get R200 cash. He said one of them immediately collapsed thereafter,
and was taken to the local clinic, where he was certified dead. “The incident allegedly happened on Sunday, 10 July,
at about 11.30pm, and investigations are ongoing,” he said. A video of the alleged incident surfaced on social
media, showing the dead man downing the Jagermeister at a go, with people
cheering him on. On Twitter, Keith Rama said: “The police are wasting
time and state resources. Let natural selection take its course.” Then Itunyiswa commented: “The prize money is even
less than the Jagermeister price. Poor guy died for nothing.” Creamyyurri added: “Please, let that game be banned
everywhere. Make it illegal and draft a law that will help protect lives. There
is a bad evil spell going on around the world and everyone must pray for
themselves and their enemies to win the battle against darkness.”
