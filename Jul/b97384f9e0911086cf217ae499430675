ACTRESS, radio DJ and presenter Nomalanga Shozi (27) has opened up about her journey as a new mum. Shozi gave birth in late February this year to a baby girl, whom she shares with Major League DJz’s Bandile Mbere. The actress told Daily Sun that being a new mum feels beautiful. She said: “It feels so beautiful being a new mum and I am unlocking a new level of love and confidence for myself and my baby as well.” She said as her daughter grows, so is she.

It’s such a lovely experience. “I thought at the age of 22 or 23 I’d be married with children already, but obviously growing up and understanding that you’re still a baby in your 20s, I didn’t think I’d be a mother at this age. Also I’m quite happy I am a mum because I personally would love to a young mum and I wanted to have kids before the age of 35,” she said. She said coping with being a new mum and presenter at the same time is not difficult as she has quite a lot of support from her and her boyfriend’s family. She said she is very happy that she still gets to work while being a mum. Shozi said she is looking forward to being a sexy mum.
