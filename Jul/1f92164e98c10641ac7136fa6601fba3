CHARLOTTE Motlhagodi is living in fear after she was brutally assaulted allegedly by her former colleague’s husband in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane, on 1 July. The 30-year-old from Rustenburg, North West, was tasked with collecting a company car from the colleague after she resigned. She was working as a sales person for a car dealership. “On that day, me and my other colleague drove to Ga-Rankuwa, but she gave us wrong locations to pick up the car. We moved from one location to another until we got tired and decided to give up,” said Charlotte. “As we were about to get some food along the way, the same car we were looking for stopped in front of us. The driver was a man and he wanted to fight us.” ALSO READ |
Cold dead gogo ngiqokiseni! Charlotte said her colleague went outside and the man grabbed the keys. “I tried to lock the door from the inside, but he had the keys. He took out a knife and started stabbing me in my face.” She said the man beat her up and pulled her hair. “He stabbed me in my face, neck and hands before driving off in the same car we came to fetch.” An ambulance and cops were called and Charlotte was taken to hospital, where she was taken to theatre. However, she had to be discharged earlier as she didn’t feel safe after the man was released on bail. Vicky Lamola from Vuka Enough and a kasi gender-based violence (GBV) activist witnessed the incident. She said it is because of reasons such as these that they were organising a march to the Union Buildings from 6 to 9 August. She said the march would start from Hammanskraal, and it aimed to emphasise that there was no reason to celebrate Women’s Day when GBV was so rife. ALSO READ |
