THE parents of baby Hlelokuhle Khumalo are pleading for the safe return of their child. She was snatched from her mum’s hands on Friday, 1 July in Zola, Soweto. She was only eight days old. Speaking to Daily Sun, Hlelokuhle’s mum Phumla and dad Bongani said their wish was to see their baby girl safely back in their arms. Phumla (36) said: “I went to Home Affairs to register the birth of my child. On my way back I decided to get off the taxi by a grocery store not far from home to get takeaways because there was load shedding.” She saw a white car parked nearby, but she didn’t pay much attention to it. She said when they got closer, the man pulled out a gun and the woman snatched her baby. Phumla said while she was still confused, the white car pulled up and the pair jumped in and the vehicle sped off. The mother of three, who is a call centre consultant, said she has no clue who would target her and her baby. She said: “All I want is for my baby to be returned back home alive. If people behind this are looking for a ransom, we are prepared to pay for her safe return. Please bring our baby back safe.” Bongani, who is an engineer in the mining industry, said he was shattered. “I get along with people very well and I’m a happy soul. The kidnapping of my daughter came as a shock. I’m deeply heartbroken that anyone could do this. “We plead with whoever is behind this to bring our baby back safely,” he said. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said cops have opened a case of kidnapping and were searching for the suspects. At the time of the kidnapping, baby Hlelokuhle was wearing brown trousers, a brown top and white socks. Police are appealing to anyone who might have information to contact investigating officer Sergeant Ntombi Masango on 078 144 7684, call the nearest police station or contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
