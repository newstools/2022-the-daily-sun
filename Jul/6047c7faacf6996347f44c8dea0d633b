A ROBBERY went horribly wrong on Sunday, 10 July, in Gqeberha, when one thug was shot dead by his accomplice. According to Captain Andre Beetge, a 34-year-old resident in Nomakanjani, Ikamvelihle, was walking home at about 8.30pm when he was approached by two armed men. “Fearing that they were going to rob him, he attempted to flee but they chased after him. They caught up and after hitting him in the face with a firearm, he fled into a nearby shack,” Beetge said. He said that one suspect chased after the victim into the shack while two others opened fire outside. “One alleged robber was shot and killed. One suspect outside, realising that he had shot and killed him, then grabbed his accomplice’s firearm and fled the scene,” Beetge said. He said the victim escaped from the incident unharmed, apart from being hit with a gun on his face. A murder docket was registered and is being investigated by the Ikamvelihle police, and anyone with information has been urged to contact Detective Captain Debbie Steyn on 082 394 8369 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
