HEALTH Minister Joe Phaahla has recovered from Covid-19 and is ready to return to work. His department released a statement on Tuesday, 26 July, saying he had resumed his normal duties after completing seven days of isolation. The minister tested positive for Covid-19 the previous Tuesday after experiencing minor symptoms. Health department spokesman Foster Mohale said the minister would be attending the 24th International Aids Conference in Montreal, Canada, from 29 July to 2 August. “South Africa has been participating in the International Aids Conference for the past two decades. This is the world’s largest conference on HIV/Aids, which brings together scientists, clinicians, academics, healthcare workers, people living with HIV, NGOs and media from across the world to share progress made in the fight against the pandemic and innovations to prevent the spread of new infections,” he said. Mohale said the minister would be holding meetings with his counterparts from various countries and donor funding organisations. “Among the key topics will be a science panel discussion, co-chaired by Professor Linda-Gail Bekker of the University of Cape Town, the launch of the global alliance initiative to end Aids in children by 2030, and talks on HIV cure and vaccine research,” said Mohale.
