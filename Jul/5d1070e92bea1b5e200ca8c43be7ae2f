FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, said he will stand for president in 2024. He made the announcement while addressing pupils at Gatang Secondary School in Mamelodi, Tshwane, on Tuesday, 26 July. He told the pupils that the future of the country depended on what they did. He said the generation before them has played its part. “Rise with me. I will rise with you as we have courage. I’ve been insulted and ridiculed, but still I am not going anywhere,” he said. He told the pupils that he will help them if they needed help and when he needed, he’ll ask for it. He thanked the pupils for being at school rather than the streets. During Duduzane’s engagement with the pupils, he said he wanted to be part of what was happening in many communities as he continued to assess and interact with them. He said he was paying his respect and appreciation for what the pupils were doing. “We have a long way to go. Let’s not mess up. We need you to be focused, disciplined and respectful to one another.” Duduzane also reminded the pupils that the future starts with them. He also told pupils the importance of respect and discipline. “Without discipline and respect, you will not go anywhere as a youth.” Duduzane also donated food parcels and cleaning material to Mamelodi Old Age Home and cleaning material to Gatang Secondary School as a token of appreciation. One of the pupils, Pontsho Letsema (14), said she felt motivated by Duduzane and believes the future was indeed in the hands of the youth.
