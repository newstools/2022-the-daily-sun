Defense attorney, Nqobizitha Mlilo questioned the state about the outstanding investigation in the matter, wanting to know whether the state was really trial ready. He said if the state says it is ready to proceed with trial they must provide them with the content of the docket. However, Mpolweni said if a matter is being investigated and the state comes to court and says they can draft an indictment, it means that the investigation in the estate is enough for it to proceed to trial. "The mere that we are asking to prepare an indictment means that we have sufficient evidence to proceed with the trial," he said All three accused will be back in the same court on 22 August, meanwhile accused 1 will continue with his bail hearing on Monday (25 July) and accused 2 and 3 will apply for bail on Wednesday (27 July).
