IT has been over three weeks since residents have been without water. The residents of Seshego extension 71B, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, can’t take it any longer. They are gatvol with the Polokwane Municipality, saying water tankers don’t go to their area regularly. They said their houses now stink as they are unable to flush their toilets. “Others are forced to kak in buckets and plastic containers and throw them in the bushes and bins. This is not healthy at all. “Most of our children went to school with out bathing when the schools reopened,” said Tumi Maokeng (34). Residents told Daily Sun there is also a fight over who gets water first when water tankers come.

They said they no longer see the need to pay municipal rates as they are not getting what they are paying for. “We pay, but we get nothing. We are tired of living like we don’t pay municipal rates. “The municipality is denying us our basic right to clean water,” said Thato Mokwena (29). The residents are threatening to take to the streets to voice their frustrations. Municipal spokesman Thipa Selala said challenges experienced by Lepelle Northern Water on the Olifantspoort and Ebenezer plants are contributing to the situation. “Ebenezer plant is not pumping water to Polokwane Municipality due to pump station three failure. “Load shedding is also contributing to the situation,” said Selala.
