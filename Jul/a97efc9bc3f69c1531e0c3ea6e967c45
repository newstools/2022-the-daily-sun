A ONE-YEAR-OLD baby girl is in hospital after being hit by a stray bullet on Saturday, 9 July. She was playing outside her home while a funeral was being held at a nearby cemetery in Pienaar, outside Mbombela. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said: “Gunshots were reportedly heard coming from the nearby graveyard where there was a burial and moments later, the child was heard screaming. “When her mother rushed outside to find out what was happening, she found her bleeding from her lower body. “The baby was then transported to a nearby clinic by a private vehicle. However, the child had to be swiftly transferred to hospital.” Mdhluli said police were notified of the incident by their hospital counterparts. “Upon arrival, a case of attempted murder was opened with an immediate launch of a manhunt for the suspect(s). Police at Pienaar have since made a call to members of the public to come forth with information regarding people who fired shots at the funeral by calling CrimeStop at 08600 10111.” Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has strongly condemned the incident.
