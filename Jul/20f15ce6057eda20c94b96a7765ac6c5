ON Wednesday, 27 July, Lieutenant-Colonel Kgabo Caiphus Mohlamme revealed how they managed to arrest murder-accused tavern owner Pontsho Mohlanka. Mohlanka had been on the run following the deaths of Mpho Makondo (8) and Simphiwe Mgcina (6). Mohlamme said it was by coincidence that Mohlanka happened to be passing the Shell garage in Protea South, Soweto, where they had briefly stopped on 25 September 2020. He testified: “We were at the garage and saw Mohlanka walking in the street.” He shared that because he had her number from the Mzwandile Zitho (5) matter, he called to see if she would answer the phone. “I called the number, and the phone rang.” That was when Mohlamme and another officer, known only as Mzazi, pounced on her and questioned her before arresting her.

I had it when I activated the LBS (system used by cops to track down a phone’s GPS co-ordinates). It matched the one I had.” He said he had previously used the system to trace Mohlanka’s number and at the time, it pointed him in the direction of Orange Farm extension 3. Mohlamme also told the court why Mohlanka was released in the Zitho matter. He said the case was withdrawn, pending results of the toxicology report. He said they were aware of the provisional release as it was brought to their attention prior to the commission of the murder of the two kids. “Mzazi received a message prior to the crime. The first one was talking about the child who was killed in April, which was on a Friday. I said we would look into the messages on Monday so we can intensify the investigation in the first case.” He said after the second incident, he informed Mzazi and was given a docket to investigate. The matter has been postponed to Friday, 29 July.
