FORMER Cape Town Spurs head coach, Ian Taylor, has been unveiled as Cape Town City’s reserve team coach. Taylor, who was Eric Tinkler’s assistant for the Citizens in 2016, is excited to be reunited with the club and looking forward to making a major contribution to the club’s development structures. The 45-year-old tactician left his assistant role at Chippa United to start a new chapter with City, with the aim of developing and preparing the club’s Diski team. For most of his coaching career, he’s worked as an assistant coach. But he believes he has learnt valuable insights that can take the Citizens to greater heights. Taylor replaces Matt Haywood and he’s brimming with confidence to make a valuable contribution to the Diski team. He said he’s pumped up and ready for the DStv Diski Challenge season to begin, and wants the club to cement their place as one of the best development teams in the country. “In any academy, there has to be a pathway. It needs to be tangible and I think everything starts with structure, organisation and then implementing the club’s philosophy down to the youth,” he said. “If our goal is to develop players for the first team, then it’s important that we do it with the younger age groups. Technically, we have very gifted players because they come from the townships and they play informal football so there’s a lot of instinctive skills but they lack the understanding of the game and decision making which is evident in PSL games. “For me it comes back to understanding the game at a very young age and that also comes back to good coaching. There are good coaches and good learners and that for me is the key because good players know how to learn and good coaches know how to teach. “When you develop properly you will win but winning is also part of the development so we have to get it right at a young age so when they get to the first team that mentality is already installed in them. Ultimately, we want to become the best academy in SA.”
