A GANG has forced people out of their own homes. The residents of Purification Farm, known to locals as Sewage Farm in Randfontein, west of Joburg, fled after a night of terror on 15 June. The residents, who are also employees of Rand West Municipality, said they feared for their lives after a neighbour was shot and killed on that fateful night. Sifiso Mtwalo (36) said a group of zama zamas arrived and surrounded their houses. He said they were armed with AK 47s and pistols, and they were clearly not afraid to use them. The thugs went from house to house, demanding cellphones, money and other valuables. Two people were shot, killing one and leaving the other in hospital. Sifiso said after the police cleared the murder scene, the killers returned that night to have dinner. Librarian Phillip Moatshe (40), who was shot in the leg, said a neighbour called to say he had seen two people outside. “When we went outside, it was dark. I couldn’t see them but they could see me. “They shot me in the leg and when I tried to run away, 15 of them surrounded me,” he said. Phillip said the zama zamas dragged him to his house and demanded money and cellphones. He said after the incident, he went home to Kagiso as he was too scared to be in his own house. Sifiso and his fiancee, Charlene Hennie (39) said they went to stay in a small house with an elderly relative and a child living with a disability. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said: “A murder case is being investigated. Currently, no one has been arrested.” They said they recently signed a lease with the municipality and they wanted help finding an alternative place to stay.
