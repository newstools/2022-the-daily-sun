IT WAS a joyful day for families and residents of Bungeni in Hlanganani, Limpopo. They danced to celebrate the return of more than 800 boys from initiation school. The excited villagers cheered as Hosi Given Bungeni’s Given Bungeni Foundation recently issued the initiates with certificates. One of the fathers, Sydwell Mthombeni, said: “We say thank you to the initiation school principal, Russel Muila for his sterling work. “He had the vision to train and guide more than 800 boys. But he and the people who work for him did well and we’re grateful to them.” READ: From boys to real men! Hosi Bungeni said: “Initiation schools are one of our cultural practices as Tsonga speaking people. We allow this initiation to take place as we want to keep our tradition and cultural heritage. “Boys who go to the bush are taught about their culture, discipline and to be obedient to elders. “It also teaches the boys not to be part of gender-based violence.” Ward 5 councillor Faneriwa Mashimbye expressed his gratitude to Collins Chabane Municipality and Vhembe District Municipality for providing water and grading of a street during the period. “Gratitude to fellow councillor Eric Xitereke Baloyi and Makhado Municipality for providing a grader for widening a street during the initiation school period, and local businessman Gideon Ngwenya for his contributions,” he said.
