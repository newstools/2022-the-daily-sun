ZULU traditional prime minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, used the commemoration of the Battle of Ulundi to calm his people about the throne dispute. The event was held at the Ulundi Old Legislature on Monday, 4 July to mark the 143rd anniversary of the battle and the burning of the capital of King Cetshwayo. Buthelezi said the Zulu nation should calm down as royal squabbles were nothing new and started a long time ago during the time of the nation’s founder, King Shaka. “The reign of King Shaka was brought to an end on 24 September 1828 when he was assassinated by his half-brothers, Prince Dingane and Prince Mhlangana,” he said. “Shortly thereafter, Prince Mhlangana was similarly dispatched and King Dingane ascended to the throne.” Although King Misuzulu didn’t attend the commemoration for undisclosed reasons, musicians led by legendary kwaito artist, Eugene Mthethwa, presented their song about the king. The song was played for the first time during the event. Mthethwa said musicians saw the need to support the king during his dispute over the throne.
