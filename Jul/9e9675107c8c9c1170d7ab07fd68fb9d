KHOLOSA Lubisi is looking for Good Samaritans to help a child-headed family. Kholosa told Daily Sun she met the family in Ngqeleni, Eastern Cape, recently after going to the area with her SABC1 show Expressions. “My goal was to find a child-headed family but I was shocked when I was referred to these three kids. They are eight, nine and 13. “Their living conditions, coupled with their pain of losing a parent, touched me. “From that day, I made a promise to help those kids. “As we speak, the Sizwe Kupelo Foundation has donated a three-room house for them,” she said. Kholosa said she initially wanted to help two families but these kids were struggling so much that she decided to focus on them. “The 13-year-old boy has the responsibility of taking care of his two siblings.

They lived in a mud hut in a bad state,” she said. Kholosa said she approached local authorities, who were happy to donate a piece of land. “We have received positive feedback from local celebrities, including Somizi Mhlongo. “We are appealing to Good Samaritans to donate furniture, food, clothes and food vouchers. “These children are too young to live alone. We are also asking for anyone who can come live with them and play a guardian role to step forward,” she said. . We would also appreciate monthly donations towards their upbringing,” she said. Sizwe Kupelo from the Sizwe Kupelo Foundation said the house would be handed over to the kids on 18 July.
