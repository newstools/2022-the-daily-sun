FOR years, residents have been complaining about piles of rubbish in the Joburg CBD – but that’s about to change. The CBD is getting a facelift as the municipality recently started the Buya Mthetho operation to clean the streets and remove informal traders without licences. But the operation has been met with mixed reactions. Social media users expressed joy seeing cleaner streets while some criticised the initiative for denying hawkers their income. Public safety MMC David Tembe said Joburg was starting to look like the city of gold again. On Tuesday, 26 July, the city released a statement saying the departments of transport, public safety and economic development will enforce by-laws. This by improving transport and maintaining presence in the Archbishop Desmond Tutu and High Court precincts. “This is to ensure that informal traders without proper documentation and the right to trade do not return to the site,” it read. The municipality said there were more than 14 000 traders, but it only had capacity for 8 100.
