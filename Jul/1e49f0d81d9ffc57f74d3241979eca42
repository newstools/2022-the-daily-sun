ANOTHER JMPD officer has died while on duty. The officer was fatally shot on Friday night, 30 July 2022 after confronting suspects in Joubert Park.  JMPD spokesman Xolani Fihla told Daily Sun that JMPD operations officers, assigned to the Buya Mthetho block patrol Undercover Unit, were working on information received of suspects involved in multiple robberies in the Joburg Inner City. "While conducting foot patrols in Joubert Park, officers spotted five suspicious males coming out of a shop at Claim Street. Officers followed the males as they turned right into Wolmarans Street," said Fihla. Officers continued to follow the males and as they turned into Wolmarans Street the males started shooting at the officers and they returned fire in retaliation. He further explained that the Metro police officer, Vongani Desmond Hlungwane (36), was shot multiple times sustaining injuries to the head, chest and leg. "Emergency Services were called to the scene and officer Hlungwane was rushed to Garden City Hospital," said Fihla. Unfortunately, officer Hlungwane succumbed to his injuries and he was declared dead at the hospital. JMPD acting chief of police, Thulani Khanyile and the entire department, are deeply saddened by the death of officer Hlungwane and wish his family, friends and colleagues heartfelt condolences. Khanyile condemned this senseless killing of officer Hlungwane and said the department will do all it could in ensuring that the suspects were brought to book. A murder and inquest docket has been opened at Hillbrow Police Station.
