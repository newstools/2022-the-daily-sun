MADALA Emmanuel Sithole has been left homeless with nowhere to go. The madala, who is in his late 80s, said he was living in the house of a woman named Nicky Ledwaba but she kicked him out because he’s originally from Zambia. The madala said he had an agreement with Nicky that he could live in the house in Seshego extension 73, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, for free. “I came to South Africa when I was 15 to look for work. I met Nicky in 2009 and she agreed that I could stay in the house and look after it. When I moved in, everything was a mess,” he told Daily Sun. “It was dirty and criminals were using the house as their shelter. I cleaned everything and I chased the criminals out. She never paid me a cent. She just came on the night of Monday, 11 July and told me to pack my things and leave.” Residents have been camping outside the house to prevent Nicky from evicting the madala. They say she should have organised alternative accommodation for him. Merry Molokomme (44) said what Nicky was doing was wrong. “He suffered a stroke in 2018 while cleaning the yard. We won’t let her treat him like trash, ” she said. But Nicky said as the owner of the house, she had the right to evict madala Emmanuel. “I’ve been telling him to move out. The residents who are against the madala moving out should accommodate him at their homes.” Advocate Puseletso Mphahlele said madala should have been given three months notice.
