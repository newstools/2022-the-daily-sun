CHILD murder accused Pontsho Mohlanka made shocking revelations in court yesterday, 26 July. The 31-year-old told the High Court sitting in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni, that she and her ex-boyfriend planned to sacrifice two children so they would never get into trouble. She said after she was released from custody following her first arrest, she went to a sangoma, allegedly organised by her ex-boyfriend, for cleansing to remove the dark spirits she had picked up in prison. The 32-year-old ex-boyfriend, who is under witness protection, was also under cross-examination by Mohlanka’s lawyer Makgalanoto Kgagara. The lawyer told him: “It is my instruction that you said two kids must be sacrificed. You told her not to tell anyone about this. “You told her she must not say anything and she must remember her child was with you.” Mohlanka said on the day of the cleansing, she saw the muthi being prepared. She said while waiting for the cleansing to start, she saw two kids – Simphiwe Mgcina (6) and Mpho Makondo (8) – who perfectly fitted what she was told she’d find. She said after she saw the kids coming into the house, she became scared and fled. She then called the police. Kgagara said: “On the phone, she told the police that there were children who were about to be killed. “She got into a taxi to Lenasia and then another to Protea in Soweto.” The ex-boyfriend denied all the claims, saying he was not involved in anything she described. “At that time, I was doing my practicals. My principal at that school can come and attest to my whereabouts on the said day. There’s also a register,” he said. “On the said day, she called me 79 times. I just said she must leave me alone.” The matter continues today, 27 July.
