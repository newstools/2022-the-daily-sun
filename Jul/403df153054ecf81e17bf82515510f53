THE deaths of three Umfolozi municipal workers within the space of two weeks in separate car crashes have left their colleagues living in fear. These shocking and untimely deaths of the three financial department workers have created fear in other workers as they don’t know who’ll be next. On 9 July, the municipality lost their accounting officer Mluleki Mbhele, who died in a car crash on the N11 in Lady-smith, KZN. And just when the municipal workers were preparing to attend Mbhele’s funeral, the municipality lost two other workers in a horrific accident. The chief finance officer’s personal assistant, Siyanda Nhleko and internal auditor Nkosiyapha Khoza, who was assigned by the Department Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, met their deaths while travelling together along the N2 in Mbonambi when they the car collided with a bakkie. Municipal spokesman Nathi Ntuli said they’re still traumatised after losing three young energetic employees. “The incidents happened in a short space and left many workers fearful of coming to work. Many of them hesitated for quite some time to come to the office as they feared they might be next,” he said. Ntuli said they’re trying to calm the situation in the municipality and things are slowly going back to normal. Describing the role that was played by the late workers, he said: “They were very young yet professional. Most of the finance department deals had to be confidential and they maintained it that way.”
