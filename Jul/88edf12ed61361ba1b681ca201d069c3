THE Kestell farm massacre suspects appeared in court on Monday 18 July. The accused, a 22-year-old and his 34-year-old uncle, allegedly killed seven people at Lismor Farm outside Kestell in the Free State, on Friday. The victims included the wife of the farm owner, his stepson and five farmworkers. Speaking outside the Kestell Magistrates Court, a representative said the family was broken. “We are still traumatised. This was a horrific attack and we don’t know who the next victims will be. We call for a harsh sentence,” he said. “We have had sleepless nights since our sister was brutalised, leaving a one-year-old child behind. Who is going to look after her child? We are all married.” The accused were arrested on Saturday on a road outside Bethlehem with two firearms, a shotgun and a pellet gun believed to have been stolen from the farm house. The deceased were identified as Nokufa Monareng (30) Lerato Moloi (33) Mothoduwa Moloi (36) Nomasonto Zulu (56), Nomasontsha Maduna (43), Sesi Smit (55) and her son Rhudie Smit (17). Sesi and Rhudie were the wife and stepson of farm owner Alheit Smit. Hundreds of residents of Kestell and surrounding areas picketed outside the court. Speaking on behalf of residents, Tankiso Motaung said women were always the victims of these incidents. “We are not healed from what happened in 2017 when a man killed six women and buried them in shallow graves,” she said. “The murderers are enjoying their rights while our sisters and mothers are no more. They will be back out on parole soon. We want Police Minister Bheki Cele to deploy amaberete all over the eastern Free State.” The case was postponed to Wednesday for a formal bail application.
