TWO men were shot and killed while sitting in their car at Nyanga Taxi Rank in Cape Town on Wednesday afternoon, 27 July. According to onlookers, the attackers walked as if they were just passing by the black Mercedes-Benz before pulling out guns and shooting the men. One of the occupants tried to run away but was shot by more bullets and died at the scene. A witness, who spoke to the SunTeam, said the killed men are not from Nyanga but from Khayelitsha. He said the men could have been in the wrong turf. He said there were gangs that do not allow members from other kasis to hang out in their areas. “This could be an issue of turfs. These guys are from Khayelitsha. I know them. “I think they came to Nyanga and overstayed their welcome,” he said. He added that if they stayed at one spot for too long, it made them an easy target. “The car was parked at the same spot for nearly an hour. So whoever shot them had enough time to plan. “The deceased went out of the car a few times and came back. At the time they were shot, they had just come back and sat inside the car.

Another witness said the two victims were both wearing black gloves. “People thought they were up to something because normally when someone is wearing gloves on a hot day, they don’t want to leave their fingerprints,” said the witness. Cops said they could not disclose more details about the incident as the case was still being investigated. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said the dead were in their 30s. “The motive for the attack is yet to be established. The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation,” said Traut.
