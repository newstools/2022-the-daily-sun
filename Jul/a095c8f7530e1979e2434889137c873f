PROTEAS head coach, Mark Boucher, is hoping his players give him a “proper headache” by performing well in their lengthy tour of England. Boucher’s side will spend three months in the United Kingdom, where they will face the Three Lions in three One-Day Internationals (ODIs), T20 Internationals and Test matches. Riverside, Old Trafford and Headingley will play host to the ODI series, Bristol, Sophia Gardens, and the Ageas Bowl will host the T20 series, while the Test series will be played at Lord’s, Edgbaston and The Oval. South Africa arrived in the UK over the past weekend and have been slowly acclimatising to the northern hemisphere summer at their early base in Taunton, in the south west of England. As part of their preparation for that initial leg of the tour, the Proteas faced the England Lions in the first of two 50 over warm up matches yesterday with the last one scheduled to take place tomorrow. Boucher has challenged the 17 players in his squad to raise their hands and stake a claim for a place in the team as they continue to prepare for the upcoming T20 World Cup in Australia later this year. “We’ve got quite a few options and these games that we’ll be playing will hopefully allow us to understand and get to know where the players are as individuals,” said Boucher. The first official match of the tour will kick off next Tuesday, when the Proteas take on England in the first of three ODI’s at The Riverside, Durham. Boucher’s side will be without skipper Temba Bavuma, who was left out of the travelling squad for the entire tour after he sustained an elbow injury. Spinner Keshav Maharaj will captain the ODI team, while David Miller has been handed the armband in the T20 internationals with Dean Elgar continuing to lead the Test side.
