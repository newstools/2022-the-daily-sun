WORLD Boxing Federation (WBF) president Howard Goldberg has lauded the “excellent work” done by the new leadership of Boxing South Africa (BSA), headed by interim CEO Ntsikayezwe Sithole. Sithole has been in charge on an interim basis since late last year and during his short tenure, he has been working hard to get try and get BSA back to where it should be. The KZN-born Sithole has been holding the fort since the resignation of former acting CEO Cindy Nkomo. And under his guidance, BSA has made massive progress, with Goldberg convinced that it’s only a matter of time before the sport regains its former glory. “I think BSA is on the right track under this new leadership,” said Goldberg. “The good work that interim CEO Mr Sithole with the rest of his staff have been doing has been very clear to see, and that’s the kind of leadership that we want. “I can see a bright future for South African boxing. The really is light at the end of the tunnel. We are seeing some world class tournaments being put together and boxing is slowly coming back to where it should be. “I remember boxing used to be the second most popular sport after football. I believe we can now get it to number one. I have faith and I think that’s achievable.” Goldberg also praised the contributions of promoters such as Jacob Mnisi of J4Joy Boxing Promotions and Joyce Kungwane of TLB Promotions, as they have hosted some top tournaments that have put the sport on the map. “These are the type of promoters that we need in the sport of boxing because you can see that they have their heart in the right place,” added Goldberg. “They are the big players in the game, and they’re doing their best to get the sport back where it belongs. “You can see that they’re passionate, and they love the sport. “We need to see more of these tournaments so that we can continue to produce top fighters.”
