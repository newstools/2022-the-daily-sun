A MAN was killed and a woman was seriously injured on Tuesday, 12 July, after their vehicle rolled off the N17 in Ermelo, Mpumalanga. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene at 7am to find a light motor vehicle lying on its side on the side of the road. “A man and woman, believed to be in their 20s, were found lying about 10 metres away from the car. “Medics assessed the patients and found that the man had already succumbed to his injuries. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead,” Meiring said. He said the woman was found with several serious injuries. “The woman was treated and provided with advanced life support before she was transported to a nearby hospital for urgent care,” Meiring said. He said authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
