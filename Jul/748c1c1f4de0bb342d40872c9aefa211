WHEN Prince Radebe (43) complained of stomach pains and was struggling to walk, his younger brother called an ambulance. He was taken to Pholosong Hospital in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, in the early hours of Thursday, 21 July. But while the family was preparing to go to visit him in the morning, the police arrived to tell them that Prince had died on the street. As sick as he was, Prince was discharged by the hospital. He then collapsed and died just after getting out of the gate. His family found medication on him, prescribed by the doctors who had seen him. The fuming family from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, now wants answers. ALSO READ | Mystery flames destroy house and RAV4 “We want the hospital to explain why it didn’t put him on a drip. My son was very stable at the time the ambulance came to fetch him,” said mum Anna Msiza. She said that people who were living at the houses next to the hospital said they saw Prince staggering out of the gate. “They asked why the hospital discharged my son in that condition,” she said, adding that they then saw him as he fell on the ground and informed security at 5.45am. “We gave the paramedics our contact details but nobody bothered to call us. We are really hurt by the treatment the hospital gave my son. If he was put on a drip, he would probably still be alive,” she said. Hospital spokesman Thabisile Mkhwanazi said they were still waiting for the report that would indicate the cause of death.
