POLICE have turned the tables on thugs who wait at traffic lights to hijack cars. Springs police in Ekurhuleni said they’ve been hard on the heels of these thugs and four of them have been cornered! On Monday night, 25 July, four suspects were caught after cops surprised them at Endicott four-way stop in Springs, which is a hijacking hot spot. Sergeant Themba Tshabalala said the suspects were found in possession of unlicensed firearms and the silver grey Polo they were using had been stolen. The car has since been confiscated. Two unlicensed firearms and ammunition were also seized by the police. Tshabalala said the suspects were charged with possession of a suspected stolen vehicle, unlicensed firearms and ammunition. “The station has created a new crime prevention unit and the station commander, Brigadier Thembeka Gwebushe, is happy that it’s yielding good results,” he said.
