BANELE Dlamini is a creative young artist who uses charcoal in his artwork. His artwork includes still life and landscapes. The 20-year-old from Rolle outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga said he fell in love with pencil or charcoal drawing in grade 11 when Covid-19 hit. “I was bored and had to keep myself busy by drawing as I had nowhere to go. At first I thought I was just playing because I never realised this was my talent. “My first sketch was of my favourite artist, Sun-El Musician. The sketch was not as impressive as I wanted it to be. But I never gave up. “My friend, Council Ntimane, supported me with pencils and paint to use on my art. He inspired me to become more confident and to practise harder than before,” he said. Banele said his dream to open an art studio in his community, where he would showcase his artwork and teach young people. “This will enable me to connect with my people and showcase our cultural diversity. I sell my work for between R150 and R1 500. “I am proud as my experience is excelling. This experience has allowed me to become a better and more skilful artist with basic pencil skills,” he said.
