THE Mphatlalatsane Village cemetery in QwaQwa, Free State became a place of great activity when the driver of a van lost control after a tyre burst on Tuesday, 12 June. The van crashed into the cemetery and many tombstones were destroyed The driver was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. Royal House representative in the village, Phomolo Dlamini, said about 15 graves were destroyed. He urged residents to visit the cemetery to check if their family members’ graves weren’t affected. “We want to make a humble plea to our people not to bury their love ones close to the road. This accident should be a lesson to all of us,” Dlamini told Daily Sun. He said some of the families were in Gauteng and KZN. “The driver has promised to fix all the damaged tombstones,” said Dlamini. “He sent his apology to the affected families.” Local traditional healer Tjhopo Ncala said this was the first incident in the history of Mphatlalatsane cemetery. “It might be regarded as a sign to the driver that he forgot about his ancestors,” Ncala said. The cemetery was established in the 1960s under the Reidel Mountain group. “I would like to encourage the driver to engage with his elders,” said Ncala. He said such things could happen as a message from ancestors. “People relocate without notifying their ancestors. That is dangerous.” Police Spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said no case was registered.
