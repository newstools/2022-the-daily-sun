DUMB thugs stole from the church and they almost got away with it. But they were bust after trying to sell their loot to church members on Saturday, 2 July. They apparently tried to break into the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Evaton, the Vaal, on Thursday 30 June but failed. The next day, they returned and managed to get into the storeroom. They left with four gas stoves, pots, a sound mixer and four speakers. On Saturday, two suspects tried to sell the gas stove to a church member for R1 400. This led to the arrest of six suspects. Church assistant Pastor Fako Mokoena told Daily Sun the thugs broke down the door of a gogo who lives on the premises and demanded to know where the altar wine was kept. She was unharmed. Police spokeswoman Constable Thulisile Msibi said six suspects, aged between 25 and 36, appeared in the Sebokeng Magistrates Court on Monday for theft, burglary and possession of stolen goods.
