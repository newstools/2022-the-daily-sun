 The Minister of Police Bheki Cele lost his temper during a
meeting with Gugulethu residents Tuesday afternoon. Cele was not impressed
after Action Society director Ian Cameron interrupted him telling him that he
had allegedly failed his own Constitution and that he's not fulfilling his
mandate. Cameron said Cele was “talking down to the neighbourhood watches and
doesn’t understand the policy framework”. “Don’t teach me about human rights, tell me about the safety
of our people. I fought for it. I nearly died for it, I was exiled for it.
Don’t provoke me, don’t talk about things that you have studied and been told
about. I have lived this life, I have lived the life of being African. People all over the world,this is #SouthAfrica Minister of police.Never visit here as crime is out of control. https://t.co/lt2lC3JjZi  I lived
life when my mother was called a kitchen girl and my father was called a garden
boy. I have lived that life and I’m not going to take any nonsense from
somebody who regards me as a garden boy, today because you regard me as a
garden boy,” said Cele. Things got more heated up when Cameron responded while in
the audience. “Shut up! Shut up! I sat here and listened to you talking
nonsense, listen, it’s your time to listen and sit down. Sit down and listen to
the young man or get out! Get out! Get out!” Cele screamed. Cameron remained
standing responding to Cele and was quickly manhandled and taken out of the
venue by cops. While outside Cameron said he doesn’t know why he was being
dragged by cops. They left him in his car and ordered him to leave the area.
