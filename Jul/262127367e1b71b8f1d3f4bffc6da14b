THE arrest of Enyobeni Tavern owner and two staff members has been met with mixed feelings. While the Eastern Cape Liquor Board, which opened criminal charges for contravention of the Liquor Act, welcomed the arrest, parents of victims complained that they only learn about it through the media. A total of 21 teenagers died of a yet unknown cause at the tavern in Scenery Park, East London, on 26 June. Following the burial of the victims, aged between 13 and 22, families called for the arrest of the owner. Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana confirmed the arrest of the tavern owner (52) and two employees, aged 33 and 34. “A team of detectives working on the case arrested them over the weekend and on Tuesday 12 July. “The suspects are being charged for contravening the Liquor Act aby selling to or supplying alcohol to minors. The tavern owner was issued a summons to appear in court on 19 August. The employees were each fined R2 000 and if they fail to pay the fine, they will have to appear alongside the owner in the East London Magistrates Court,” said Kinana. Liquor Board spokesman Mgwebi Msiya welcomed the arrest. He said he hoped it would send a message that those who sold liquor to underage people would be arrested. Xolile Malangeni, the father of one the victims, said: “I’m not happy with how the police are dealing with the matter. “They did not inform us about the arrest. This clearly shows they are sidelining us. I wonder if they will do the same when the post mortem results are back.”
