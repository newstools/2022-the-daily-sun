ON the field, Abia Nale is an attacking midfielder but off the field, he’s mostly on the defensive – from the repo man. Today, the bank is after him as it seeks to repossess his BMW after he allegedly failed to keep up with his monthly payments. Nale (35) bought the pre-used BMW 4 series in 2016 and was meant to pay an instalment of just over R12 000 a month. But as things stand, he might find himself walking the streets of the Vaal after BMW Financial Services took him to court for breach of contract. According to the court papers seen by Daily Sun, Nale bought the BMW 420i Gran Coupe M Sport for R722 700 over 71 months. The first payment was due in November 2016. But this agreement, according to the court papers, didn’t go as planned.  The papers read: “In breach of the instalment sale agreement, the defendant has failed to make due and punctual monthly payments to the plaintiff and is in arrears in the sum of R30 873, as at the time hereof the outstanding balance due by the sum the defendant to the plaintiff in terms of the instalment is R364 542.” Letter of demand were sent to Nale, but he apparently didn’t respond. “Despite lawful written demand, the defendant has failed to make payment of the arrears, and the plaintiff has elected to take repossession of the vehicle and claim the difference between the outstanding balance.” BMW seeks an order from the court to repossess the car and sell it at an auction. to recover their money. The company declined to comment while Nale’s phone and text messages went unanswered.
