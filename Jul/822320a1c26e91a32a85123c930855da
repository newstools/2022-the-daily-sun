A MAN, who was accused of killing his wife and leaving her body in the boot of a car in Queens, USA, was charged with her murder on Wednesday, 6 July. Kareem Flake (30) was charged with the murder after the decomposing corpse of his 26-year-old partner, Destini Smothers, was discovered by workers last March in South Ozone Park. The New York Post reports that Smothers, who shared both of her children with Flake, had been missing since November 2020. She was last seen leaving Bowlero bowling alley in Woodside after a birthday party. That night, the couple got into a “heated argument,” according to the missing person’s report filed at the time. READ: ‘I’m not selling isibindi sa bantu!’ The publication said the city medical examiner’s office determined that Smothers died of blunt force trauma to the head, causing a skull fracture and brain injury. Flake was arrested on 7 April in Kissimmee in Florida on domestic battery charges against a different woman. The outcome of that case was unclear.
