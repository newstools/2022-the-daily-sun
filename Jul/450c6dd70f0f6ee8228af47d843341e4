SHE and her husband have been selling liver and pap for more than five years. Today, the business has grown from a small shack to a butchery and shisa nyama. But haters from Rondebult, Ekurhuleni are now accusing Thulani Qwabe (40) of selling human liver. When Daily Sun visited her, she opened her fridges to show the SunTeam the beef liver she stocked and braais for her customers. “I buy the liver from the abattoir and it hurts to see people throw such allegations. The allegations are destroying my business. I no longer get customers like before,” said Thulani. She said her troubles started after her husband was arrested. “My husband’s car was seen at a crime scene where someone was shot dead, and that was enough for people to accuse him of murder. What my husband was arrested for has nothing to do with this business,” she said.  Thulani said people were making false accusations because her business was growing. “I’m very hurt because I’ve been told by community leaders to close my business. I have four kids to support,” she said. She said she has been given until Sunday, 10 July to close down. “I leave everything up to God because I know my business is clean,” she said. Daily Sun met the community leaders, who confirmed that they told the woman to close the business until her husband’s name was cleared. “Until such time, she won’t operate,” said one community leader. Thulani said she reported to the police that she lived in fear and police advised her to get a protection order. Captain Manare Ramotshela confirmed that Thulani’s husband was arrested as his car was used in the commission of a crime, where three people were shot and one died. “Police went to the butchery and didn’t find any evidence of human parts or liver, as people claim,” said Ramotshela. He said that the husband and three suspects appeared in court last week, and will appear again soon.
