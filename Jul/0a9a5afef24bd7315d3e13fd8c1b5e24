THE family of a sangoma who was brutally shot and killed by an unknown suspect is now sleeping with one eye open because of fear. A family member said because they don’t know why sangoma Mzamo Mtshali was killed, they’re afraid that the killer might come back to finish them off. The 36-year-old sangoma from Ophondweni Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, was shot and killed at his home by an unknown suspect on Thursday, 14 July. Mzamo’s younger sister, Gcina Mtshali (32), said she was in a taxi when she received a message from Mzamo’s ithwasa, telling her to rush home because Mzamo had been shot. “I rushed home and found my brother lying in a pool of blood. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I called out his name, but he didn’t respond,” said Gcina. She said when the incident happened, Mzamo was alone so they believe that whoever shot him was watching all their movements. Gcina said when he was shot, the initiate was steaming in another house, while her other brother was taking a bath in another house. “The person who did this was watching every move in our yard. “Even when there was a gunshot sound, it sounded like it was coming from far. That’s why people who were home at that time didn’t even rush outside to check. “They also didn’t see anyone running away or a car driving away after the incident,” she said. Gcina said they hope and pray that the cops will arrest the person who did this so that they will know why Mzamo was killed in this manner. “It’s hard to sleep because we don’t know whether the person will come back and finish us off. “Mzamo was a very friendly person who had no enemies, so we are still puzzled about who killed him and why he was killed,” said Gcina. KZN police spokeswoman Constable Thenjiwe Ngcobo said a case of murder was opened at Mtubatuba cop shop after a 36-year-old man was shot and killed at Ophondweni Village. “The matter is still under investigation,” said Ngcobo.
