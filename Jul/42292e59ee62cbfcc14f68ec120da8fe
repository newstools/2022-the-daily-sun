A SIX-YEAR-OLD boy was playing with his friends at his home. But the three-roomed shack at Greenpoint in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, was accidentally set on fire on Wednesday, 29 June. It was reported the boy and his two friends lit a candle to pray, but it fell on the bed and burnt the house. His sister (22) told Daily Sun she left the house keys with her brother when she went to school. “I left the key so he can lock the house when he goes out to play. Instead, his friends came over. They played a church game where someone is the pastor and others are congregants. They lit a candle next to the bed and this led to the fire,” she said. The boy said he lit the candle at first, but extinguished it. His friend lit it again and left the bedroom, but it fell. “When I went in the bedroom, the bed was on fire. We tried to stop the fire, but we couldn’t. We closed the door and ran away,” said the boy. His sister, who is unemployed, said their mother died in 2019 and she looks after her daughter and brother. “We survive on grants and I would be happy if someone helps me. So far, the mother of the boys who were playing with my brother has helped us rebuild a one-roomed shack so we can have somewhere to live. We have lost everything,” she said. Jermaine Carelse, City Fire and Rescue Services spokesman, said: “The emergency call was received at approximately 1.36pm of a structure burning in Greenpoint informal settlement on 29 June. A single structure was destroyed, leaving three people displaced. The blaze was extinguished at 2.37pm and the cause is undetermined.”
