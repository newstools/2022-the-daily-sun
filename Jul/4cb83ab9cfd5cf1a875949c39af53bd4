THE Numsa congress was scheduled to start on Monday, 25 July at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, but was stopped by a court interdict. The suspensions of the union’s second deputy president, Ruth Ntlokotse, and other members were also set aside. In a judgment on Saturday, 23 July, Judge Graham Moshoana said: “It’s declared that the suspensions of Ntlokotse and other Numsa members mentioned in this judgment are unconstitutional, invalid and unenforceable in law. “Numsa is interdicted and restrained from proceeding with the 11th National Congress scheduled to take place on 25 July-29 July until it fully complies with the terms of its own constitution.” On Sunday, 24 July, Numsa veterans hosted a virtual media briefing to reflect on some of the challenges. Speaking on behalf of the veterans, Phutas Tseki, said: “Our contribution to building this union is unquestionable. “We are therefore obliged to raise our concerns when we observe a serious political detour from Numsa values of open robust debates and internal democracy. “Towards this (interdicted) National Congress, we observed many incidents – marches to the head office of the union and suspension of many shop stewards and office bearers. The last straw is the incidents of the suspension of the deputy president of the union.” Tseki said the current state of affairs in the union was not sustainable as it left many injured, and would soon expose the truth that should have been realised today. Meanwhile, Numsa said it would study the judgment.
