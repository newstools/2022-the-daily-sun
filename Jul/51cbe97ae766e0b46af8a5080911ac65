POLICE are looking for the family of an unknown man who was found hanging from a tree last Friday, 1 July. The dead man has been estimated to be between the ages of 30 and 40. Constable Patricia Mgijima said police were called to the scene in Esselen Park bushes next to Tembisa Licensing Department. “It’s alleged that a security guard from the department was patrolling when he noticed a person hanging from a tree and notified the police,” she said. Mgijima said on arrival, police found the body of a man with his face covered with a towel. “He was neatly dressed, with both arms and legs tied. It looks like the body had been on the scene for a few days as it was starting to decompose.” She added that the victim had no form of identification, and the police could not even take his fingerprints due to the state of decomposition. “Tembisa police are appealing to community members who have missing loved ones to contact Detective Sergeant Dan Moloantwa or Detective Constable Nhlanhla Chavalala for more information. “Community must always remember that there is no waiting period to report a missing person. Even if you do not have their photo, you still have a right to open a case and later hand in the photo.” Anyone with information has been urged to visit Tembisa Police Station or call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
