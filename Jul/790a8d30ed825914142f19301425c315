INFORMAL traders will now be able to make a living in peace at Park Station. This after the South Gauteng High Court dismissed Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa) application to stop them from operating in the premises. The South African Informal Traders Forum has welcomed the ruling, which will see more than 60 people going back to business. The forum’s spokesman Brian Phaaloh said the court decision meant Prasa would no longer harass them. “It means a lot as they will be able to do business without being intimidated by both Prasa officials and the vigilante groups,” he said. He said they had been prohibited by Prasa from making a living from 21 June until the date of the court’s order on Monday, 11 July. The Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI), which represented the traders conducting informal trade at Park Station, said because of the prohibition, the traders had lost their sole source of income which for many of them supported themselves, their children and extended family. Prasa had approached the court on an urgent basis for interdictory relief. “We welcome the court’s decision as a reminder that the ability to make a living cannot be separated from the right to dignity and that it must be respected at every level of society,” said SERI’s attorney Khululiwe Bhengu.
