LIKE the name of their creche, kids at Injabulo Daycare Centre in Evaton, Vaal are now happy and free. Their teachers, principal and mastandi are also happy to be living in a healthy environment. For the past month, the creche was flooded by kak water. The story was published last week. When SunPower knocked on the door of the stubborn Emfuleni Municipality that had been dragging its feet for over a month, it was cleaned up in two days. Creche teacher Nontsikelelo Dlwathi expressed her gratitude to the Peoples’ Paper. “We can now open the windows and taste the fresh air which we had been missing for a long time. We are able to wash dishes and cook freely without fear of seeing faeces floating in the kitchen sink. “The children must please come back now. It will be a pleasure seeing them play freely again. Thank you, Daily Sun. You must help others.” Worried about diseases, some parents apparently decided not to bring kids to the creche. When Daily Sun visited after the manhole was unblocked and the yard cleaned, it was a completely different picture and the sewage smell was no longer in the air. Mastandi gogo Deliwe Mtimkulu is also happy after it was cleared. She kept repeating how grateful she was and that she’d now move freely. “These people came and cleaned up the yard. “The kids won’t be sick anymore. Thank you and thank you again.” Emfuleni Municipality failed to comment at time of going to print.
