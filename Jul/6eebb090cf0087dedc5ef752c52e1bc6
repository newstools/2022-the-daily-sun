RESIDENTS of Ikageng in Koster, North West, followed their passion and started farming – creating jobs in the process. Dirang Batswana Greenery was started in 2019 with the aim to boost local economy and create jobs. “We were tired of sitting at home doing nothing when we decided to ask families to start gardens for them,” said Girly Matsile, the deputy chairwoman. “In 2019 we managed to find a place of work and we never looked back. We were motivated by the poverty and unemployment around us.” She said they now had 15 young people working with them. “The problem with businesses not progressing is people give up too easily.” She said starting a business needed hard work and dedication. “Our challenge was crime. Thugs would break into the farm and steal from us. Which could be a setback, but we never gave up,” she said. “We get many customers from local shops and schools. We supply fresh vegetables.” Among other products, they grow potatoes, cabbages, onions, spinach, carrots and beetroot. Chairman Solly Sekanka said their dream was to expand the business to employ more people. One of the workers, Titus Moshweunyana (58), said he was grateful for the opportunity. “I have been working here for over a year now and I have learnt so much. I am also able to feed my family,” said Titus. Another worker, Alleta Sebeela (37) said skills development was important for them to change their situations. “I have motivated others to use their own hands to generate income,” she said.
