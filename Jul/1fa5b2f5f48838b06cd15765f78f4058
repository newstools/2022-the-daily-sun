COLOMBO, SRI LANKA PRESIDENT Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country on Wednesday, 13 July and protesters stormed the prime minister’s office demanding his ouster, when an uprising over an economic crisis overwhelmed security. Rajapaksa called speaker of parliament to say he’d resign later, and that his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should be interim president – infuriating Sri Lankans struggling with months-long shortages of food, fuel and electricity. His flight brought an end to the rule of the powerful Rajapaksa clan that has dominated politics for the last two decades. Wickremesinghe’s office declared a state of emergency and curfew with immediate effect, but then cancelled it. His office said the moves would be announced later. “Protesters have no reason to storm the prime minister’s office. They want to stop the parliamentary process. But we must respect the Constitution. Security forces have advised me to impose an emergency and a curfew,” Wickremesinghe said. – REUTERS
