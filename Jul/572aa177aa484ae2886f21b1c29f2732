ZANELE-Mbokazi Nkambule is known for her strong Christian values and beliefs. But on Wednesday, 13 July, she had to defend herself after allegations that she was training to become a sangoma. The allegations came from controversial blogger Musa Khawula on his Twitter account. Musa said that the Crown Gospel Awards founder went to thwasa after she wasn’t eating for two weeks. “Zanele Mbokazi-Nkambule is at initiation school to become a sangoma. This comes after she wasn’t herself and not eating for two weeks,” said Musa on Twitter. Zanele defended herself on Instagram. “I am sitting in my lounge at home and boom – this. WeMusa Khawula, asazani, ungangibhedeli mina use utrende ngamanga. Get your facts straight, my boy,” responded Zanele. ALSO READ: Mnakwethu viewers not happy with Mseleku! Musa didn’t back down, but asked Zanele to send a photo of herself sitting in her lounge, to which she didn’t respond. Soon after that, Zanele’s PR company Mirror PR and Events issued a statement, denying Musa’s claims. According to Bishop Sikhumbuzo Mathebulo, which in the statement was defined as the bishop who works closely with Zanele in the ministry, she never went to an initiation school. However, the bishop insisted that she is a healer and a prophet. He said: “It is not true that Zanele is at an initiation school. Zanele has an amazing gift from God. Those who have been close to her over the years, have seen it. She didn’t go to any initiation school, she didn’t thwasa, and she is not a sangoma. This is a gift she has always had, she prophesies, she prays and heals people.” He added: “This is a gift from God. What has changed in the past few weeks is that more and more people have been coming from all corners for prayers and her gift has just blossomed. We have been praying with her and we thank God for what is happening through her life.” A post shared by Zanele Mbokazi (@mbokazizanele)
