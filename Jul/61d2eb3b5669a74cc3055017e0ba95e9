RESIDENTS and family members of the slain tavern patron from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, say they’re excited that justice will finally prevail. This follows the arrest of an Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department (EMPD) officer suspected to be behind the shooting of six people at Putlane tavern in Katlehong two weeks ago. According to the victim’s brother Themba Zwane, the family wants justice to be served. He said although the cops have not officially informed them, they’re relieved that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Themba said his brother Sibusiso Hlatshwayo (29) was buried over the weekend after two weeks of investigations. On the day that Sibusiso was killed, he was involved in an argument, which allegedly led to a fight with the suspect and his friends. Residents told Daily Sun that after the fight, the suspect was allegedly going around his kasi vowing that Sibusiso was not going to see the weekend. Sibusiso was shot on Friday, 8 July, together with his two friends and other patrons. Beans Dlamini (55) was shot and killed when he tried to beg the killers not to shoot Sibusiso. Two of Sibusiso’s friends, who were with him that day, had to be admitted to hospital. Themba said after the shooting, community members were angry and wanted to take law into their own hands. “We had to beg for calm and they listened. We are grateful for that,” he said. “We want the law to deal with officers who are abusing their powers,” said a resident. Colonel Dimakatso Sello said the suspect was arrested on Friday, 22 July. National Prosecuting Authority’s Phindi Mjonondwane said the suspect didn’t appear at Palm Ridge Magistrates Court yesterday, 25 July, as the matter was not enrolled.
