FORMER Banyana Banyana star Portia Modise ate humble pie and congratulated Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis and her team for winning the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon). This after bashing and accusing Desiree of not doing anything for the development of Banyana Banyana. At that time, she said: “The truth is she has done nothing.” She was speaking at the launch of her book, titled From Portia Modise With Love.  But now she has changed her tune and is rooting for Desiree In her posts, she said: “I’m so proud to be a legend of Banyana Banyana. These girls did it for us. To Coach Des with your technical team, we salute you. You did it. Whatever happened and whatever we said doesn’t matter right now because at the end of the day you did it. You’re the queens of Africa and you made history.” She then addressed the issue of inequalities in football and said: “I’m sitting here thinking that Banyana Banyana have become queens of Africa and they are the bosses of our country. They are making us proud as Mzansi. When they come back we’ll be at the airport to welcome them back. But some of them do not have cars. This means a whole queen of Africa will be taking a taxi back home. This is not good and I’m not happy with it. These are the queens and private cars should be hired to drop them off at home. They shouldn’t be travelling by taxis. We don’t want to see them in taxis.” She went on to demand a raise for them. “They must get R2 million each so they can become proper celebrities. They must drive luxurious cars and live in big houses. If they can give you this kind of money, your lives will change. I’m proud of you.”
