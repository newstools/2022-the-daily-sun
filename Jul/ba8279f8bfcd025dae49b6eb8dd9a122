ADVOCATE Malesela Teffo walked away from trial, claiming his life was in danger. But Zandie Khumalo-Gumede is not buying it. “He claimed he had proof that Kelly pulled the trigger,” she said on Instagram. “HE PROMISED US AN EYEWITNESS, THEN JIKI JIKI HE TURNS AROUND AND WITHDRAWS!” On Wednesday Zandie, who is Kelly Khumalo’s sister, lambasted Teffo for withdrawing from the Senzo Meyiwa murder case. “It looks like one is never going to get their day in court because people entrusted with this case have turned it into a circus,” she posted, adding that it looked like the case would not be resolved soon. “South Africa believes opportunists and populists, like this one.  “It pains me because it means the Meyiwa family will never get justice and mine will live under this dark cloud forever.” She said Teffo claimed to have an eyewitness. “Uphi? Where is this eyewitness? He had his two minutes of fame.” Zandie further said the desperate desire to find the Khumalos guilty meant people believed anyone who said what they wanted to hear. “Why are they not calling us. Why are we not questioned?” she asked. Teffo said he had seen the post. “I see it as a provocation. I’m also aware that she and certain people were celebrating after my withdrawal. But this is not the end. I shall be meeting my legal representative to discuss the way forward, including the contents of Zandie’s post,” he said. But Zandie denied she was celebrating his withdrawal. “He is allowed to do what he wants. This post was not about provoking him. It came from a place of disappointment,” she said. Family spokesman Sifiso Meyiwa said: “We are saddened and disappointed by Teffo’s withdrawal. We are aware that he’s been getting life-threatening messages. We are happy with his work. He managed to bring the original docket to the attention of the court.” He said the Khumalos could rejoice for now, but this was not over.
