THE Mpumalanga farmer who was charged with knocking over three girls on his farm told the Ermelo Magistrates Court that it was an accident. Louis Grobler is applying for bail after he was arrested on Friday, 15 July and charged with three counts of attempted murder and one of assault. Investigating officer, Sergeant Mduduzi Mkhwanazi, told the court the state was opposing bail because the accused’s family and friends were interfering in the case, and that the case was racially motivated. Mkhwanazi claimed the accused’s friend offered to pay one of the victims’ father R150 000 for medical bills and to withdraw the matter. It is alleged that the accused intentionally drove over the girls who were picking up maize that fell to the ground on his farm, Smithfield between Ermelo and Lothair, where the victims also live. Mkhwanazi told the court that the three suffered injuries and one of them was still in hospital. He said she might have to undergo an operation as she suffered a bone fracture. Grobler’s lawyer, Mario Jungbluth, said the girls emerged from the side where he was driving. Grobler claimed that he tried to apply brakes but failed and knocked down the girls. He said he then called the cops and emergency services. One of the girls’ father (38) told Daily Sun: “I have now lost my job because of this. I want justice for my daughter.” The matter was postponed to Friday, 22 July for closing arguments on bail.
