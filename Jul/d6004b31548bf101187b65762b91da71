WHEN the former station commander Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata left Nyanga cop shop last month, residents were heartbroken. They knew they were losing a top cop who had arrived in Nyanga in 2014 when the kasi was known as SA’s murder capital. But now it is not even in the top 20. Ncata, who has now being promoted to major general in the Nelson Mandela Bay, has hit the ground running. Police in his area have seized over 100 illegal guns in raids. A variety of firearms were confiscated in raids, roadblocks, searches and targeted operations between May and July. Ncata said: “Scores of suspects were charged in relation to the seizures and the confiscated firearms will be sent for ballistics testing.” Our members will remain unyielding in our stance in eradicating and removing illegal firearms from the hands of criminals.” According to the police’s quarter four crime stats, Nelson Mandela Bay police stations have recorded the highest number of serious crimes in the Eastern Cape. Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “The focus on firearms is high up on the list of police priorities and one of the core objectives.” She said in one incident during the Govan Mbeki Avenue patrol, cops recovered two firearms, two replica guns, and an air rifle. A 28-year-old old suspect was arrested. and confiscated the weapons and mandrax and cocaine. “Members of the Anti-Gang Unit patrolling in Bellflower Road in Bethelsdorp found an 18-year-old suspect with a revolver and 16 rounds of ammunition. A 9mm pistol with eight rounds was also found after it was tossed into the bushes by an unknown male in Bloemendal,” said Naidu.
