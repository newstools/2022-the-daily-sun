IT was a welcome befitting of African champions awaiting newly crowned Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (Awcon) champs Banyana Banyana at the OR Tambo International Airport on Tuesday. Hundreds of supporters, dressed in their various soccer jerseys and some unique clothing, rocked up in Kempton Park on the East Rand to welcome the Queens of Africa. The Mzansi senior women’s team made history when they won their maiden Awcon title in Morocco on Saturday, beating the hosts 2-1 in the final played at a packed Prince Moulay Stadium in Rabat. Hildah Magaia was the match winner for Banyana on the day, scoring both s goals in the second half to ensure Desiree Ellis’ charges shake off the bridesmaid’s tag having lost five finals. Ellis, along with her entire squad and staff, were nearly reduced to tears when they stepped out of the Airport to scenes of jubilation from the supporters who came to give the team Heroes' welcome.  Also present at OR Tambo were several dignitaries, including Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa, Gauteng MEC for Sport Mbali Hlophe, Ekhuruleni Mayor Tania Campbell and South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan. Ellis spoke about some of the challenges that the team overcame in Morocco, including the loss of star player Thembi Kgatlana through injury and their battle against Covid-19 in the camp. “The tournament wasn’t easy, we faced a lot of challenges, but we managed to pull through,” said Ellis. “We lost Thembi (Kgatlana) and there was a sombre mood. But Thembi reminded us why we were there, and we still had objectives to achieve. We also had a couple of Covid cases and Safa really came through big time for us regarding that. “This team is just phenomenal, every time people wrote us off and they thought we were down and out, we just raised our levels. We are proud to have brought hope to the nation.” Banyana star and hero in the final, Magaia, said everything was still surreal to her and hadn’t fully grasped the magnitude of their achievement. “I see all these supporters here and I realize that what we have done is great for the country,” added Magaia. “But I still pinch myself, I don’t think It will fully register until everything has calmed down a bit.” The atmosphere at the OR Tambo International Airport ahead of #BanyanaBanyana arrival.
