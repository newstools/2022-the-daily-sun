THE teenage girl watched in terror as four armed men attacked her older brother as he was stepping out of his VW Amarok bakkie on Monday night, 11 July. Suspects demanded the keys, which he handed over. But instead of leaving, they pushed him into their house in Ratanda, Heidelberg, and tied him up. The teenager screamed for help, and that caused her unbearable pain. To stop her screaming, one thug switched the kettle and boiled water, and poured it over her left leg. The girl, still traumatised and in pain, told Daily Sun: “I ran to the kitchen and screamed for help, and the thugs told me I was irritating them. One of them boiled the water and poured it over me. I screamed in pain.” While they were still in the house, the thugs tied up her brother and then shot her 48-year-old father in the upper body. He later died in hospital. The thugs then took their cellphones and fled in the bakkie. Ratanda cops were called to the scene and the bakkie was located by tracker. Sergeant Moss Maluleke said their crime prevention unit and the tracker company followed the robbers, but they dumped the bakkie near Tsakane extension 22, Ekurhuleni. Cases of murder, attempted and hijacking were opened at Ratanda Police Station. Cops have appealed to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the four suspects to contact Ratanda cop shop or send an anonymous tip on the MySAPS App.
