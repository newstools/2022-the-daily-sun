THE World Changers Candidates organisation has launched a petition, calling for the removal of the sale of alcohol from school functions. In a statement released on Thursday, 28 July, the organisation said it launched an online petition to call for the removal of clause 8 section 8A of the Basic Education Law Amendment (BELA) Bill. The bill was introduced in Parliament in January, proposing that schools be allowed to have alcohol sold on premises for fund-raising purposes. Organisation chairman Lucas Mahlakgane said drugs, in any form, should not be allowed at schools. “While the bill forbids the possession, sale and consumption of alcohol during school hours, we are deeply concerned that allowing the sale at any given time would have a lasting detrimental effect on learners’ safety, and disrupt the very space aimed at nourishing and protecting children,” Mahlakgane said. The organisation, that is dedicated to fighting the surge of drugs and alcohol abuse, has called on the public to participate on the petition. The promised change has a deadline extension for written submission set for 15 August. The petition can be accessed and signed on the Change.org platform (https://chng.it/rtXyn7hnSF). “Once enough signatures have been collected, the petition will be presented to the Basic Education portfolio by the World Changers Candidates.”
