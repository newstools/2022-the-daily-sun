Andile told Daily Sun how much he appreciated the role that Pakama is playing in his life. “She is my rock. I met her at a time when the chips were down in my life. She has shown me the true meaning of true love in so many ways. That is why I always do everything to show her how grateful I am to her.” The star was struck by tragedy a few years ago following the untimely death of his previous wife in a car accident. The media-shy Pakama was not available for comment. But she previously told the People’s Paper that despite initially being skeptical of dating a soccer player as they are notorious for being “players”, she soon realised that Andile was a kind-hearted loving person.
