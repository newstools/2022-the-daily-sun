THUGS are targeting schoolkids who carry expensive cellphones. They apparently wait until school is out to prey on the kids. A pupil opened a case after one of the suspects slapped her and took her Huawei P40 Lite. Krugersdorp cops are now looking for the suspects. Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said on 9 May, a pupil (16) was on her way home from school when she was robbed of her Huawei P40 Lite by unknown men. “The victim was walking on Robin Street in Chancliff, Krugersdorp when she was followed by a grey Honda. “Suddenly one of the suspects jumped out of the vehicle and slapped the victim on the face before robbing her of her cellphone,” Sibiya told daily Sun. It’ s believed the man in the picture could help the police with the matter. The suspect was wearing a pink hooded jacket, black takkies and dark blue jeans. Police are appealing to anyone who knows the suspect’s whereabouts to call investigating officer Warrant Officer Nicolene Mckie on 083 254 2209, CrimeStop on 08600 10111, or Krugersdorp police on 011 951 1151.
