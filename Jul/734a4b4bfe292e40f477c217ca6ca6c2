I recall receiving your calls twice. “You were telling me that you were closing the tavern and coming home because business was slow, but you never made it home. “Instead, my brother arrived later to tell me about your death. I couldn’t believe it until I was greeted with naked bodies in a pool of blood.”  Pastor Steven Mhlongo of Ambassadors of God’s Kingdom Church said whoever killed the innocent would be judged before God. “It doesn’t matter whether you are clever, rich or poor, we are all going to die.
