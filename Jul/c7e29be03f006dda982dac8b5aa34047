DOWN with the government, down! This is what the Congress of the People (Cope) Youth Movement chanted while they marched to the Union Buildings on Monday, 11 July. The movement said they were gatvol with government not taking the youth seriously. They said they took it upon themselves to march against the unemployment crisis, high fuel prices and load shedding. Isaac Kgosana, chairman of the movement in Tshwane, said thousands of graduates and matriculants with various qualifications were sitting at home unemployed. “Everything that is happening in our country is affecting the youth, be it fuel prices, load shedding and joblessness,” he said. “Today we are here to confront President Cyril Ramaphosa and government with a list of grievances and table a list of possible solutions to the unemployment crisis, high fuel prices and Eskom’s load shedding crisis.” Cope’s national spokesman, Dennis Bloem, said they saw a need to support the march as young people were suffering. “Our young people said they cannot go on like this because their future is at stake,” said Bloem. He said the electricity problem would be solved if the government employed qualified and skilful people to do the job. He said the government should open old trade schools as there was a shortage of skills. “Government must immediately stop these high prices and open their own refineries so that we don’t have to import fuel,” he said. Bloem said they were giving the president seven days to respond. An official from the presidency, Vincent Ngcobo, received the memorandum.
