KZN-BASED Motsepe Foundation Championship club, Uthongathi FC, have sold part of their shares to the Eastern Cape ABC Motsepe League outfit Spears of the Nations, SunSport has learnt. It’s not clear whether the club is going to move to the Eastern Cape or remain in KZN. But the possibility that the club will remain in KZN is likely, as Spears of the Nation doesn’t have the facilities that meet the PSL’s high standards. “They wanted the team to relocate to the Eastern Cape, including the players and the technical team. “But they found facilities (in EC) were not up to standard, the clubhouse was not up to scratch, and they were not happy with a lot of things. “They are integrating both teams to try and form one team. I’m not sure if it will still remain as Uthongathi FC. The club has sold some shares, not the club, to the owner of Spears of the Nation from the Eastern Cape,” said an insider. Speculation was that the club is up for sale, but Uthongathi recently released a statement that it wasn’t for sale. “As much as they released a statement that the club is not for sale, they are entering into a partnership,” said the mole. “They don’t want to lose the status and relocate elsewhere and have another person who will give directives.” Another source close to both clubs said: “Something is happening but we don’t know what it is yet. When it does make sense, I will inform you.” The club fired coach Papi Zothwane last week. Uthongathi chairman Nompumelelo Nhlumayo wasn’t available for comment.
