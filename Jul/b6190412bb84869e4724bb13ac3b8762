COPS had to save a man from furious motorists on Friday afternoon, 22 July after he threw his girlfriend out of his moving car. Motorists who saw the woman falling from the car in Sebokeng, Vaal, chased the man and forced him to return to where the injured woman was, to explain himself. The man told Daily Sun he was from Kibler Park and his girlfriend was from Orange Farm. He said they got into a fight and he stabbed her in the back, so he was taking her to the nearest clinic. The man claimed the woman didn’t want to go to the clinic and she opened the car door while he car was in motion. But the woman told paramedics the man wanted to kill her and dump her in an area where people didn’t know her. When the cops arrived at the scene, the man had soiled himself out of fear. Paramedics said the woman had stab wounds to her back and her leg was broken. She was rushed to Sebokeng Hospital. Sebokeng police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto said the man was arrested for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He’s expected to appear in the Sebokeng Magistrates Court today.
