“MY son’s spirit is fighting for justice.” These were the words of Kutlwano Kasibe’s mum, Dorah, after the three suspects charged with his murder were denied bail. Yesterday, 12 July, the suspects, aged between 31 and 36, appeared in the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto for a formal bail application. The court gallery expressed great relief when Magistrate David Mhango denied the accused bail. The trio remained in custody. “I’m very happy. We have been praying very hard for this day. I’m grateful for the support that my community has been showing me in this difficult time. “My son’s spirit will continue to fight for justice. This is not the end. Those who are already behind bars must reveal the identity of others. “I want to see more people arrested for the murder of my son,” said Dorah. She said she was also intending on reporting an alleged bribery attempt to the police. Last week, Dorah told Daily Sun that after Kutlwano’s funeral, she was approached by unknown men who asked her to name any amount of money in exchange for dropping the charges faced by the accused. Kutlwano (16) from Molapo in Soweto, who was mentally challenged, was allegedly tied to a tree, doused with ice water, sjambokked and shocked with a car battery. It’s alleged that his wounds were sprayed with sanitisers. Kutlwano died moments later in hospital after residents claimed he stole a tap.
