MAMELODI Sundowns Diski Challenge side are fired up and ready to face the in-form Kaizer Chiefs reserves in what promises to be a blockbuster DStv Diski Shield semi-final encounter at Giant Stadium on Saturday (12.30pm). Masandawana booked their semi-final spot following their 2-1 victory over a tough Orlando Pirates outfit last weekend. Downs coach Surprise Moriri was elated when his charges advanced to the next round of the tournament. However, he is wary of the ball-playing Amakhosi, coached by Vela Khumalo. Moriri believes the game will be hard considering the blistering form of Amakhosi and how they’re currently hyped by the fans. Moriri said his boys are well conditioned and prepared to upset Chiefs and go all the way to win the Diski Shield trophy. “It’s good that we qualified for the semi-final but I must say it was a very difficult game against Pirates considering that it was our first official game (this season) and you never know how the game will go,” Moriri told the media. “I think the boys came to the party and we did the job that put us through to the semi-finals, everyone is happy and the boys are very happy but we know that we still have to do our best to make sure that we qualify for the final. “On Saturday, it’s going to be a very interesting game, our matches against Chiefs are always interesting so I’m anticipating a very open game. “Chiefs are a club that are forward oriented and willing to play good football, but my boys know that we really have to compete to book our spot in the final, but the preparations are going well and we’re looking forward to the game.”
