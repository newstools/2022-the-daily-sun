NEWLY elected Gauteng ANC chairman Panyaza Lesufi has admitted that the road to the 2024 general elections will be a thorny one. Lesufi assumed the provincial top job after defeating Cooperate Governance MEC Lebogang Maile. The new economic country’s hub leader was quick to extend an olive branch to the defeated faction, but he was taking over at a time when the governing party was at its lowest – with a real threat of not winning the majority vote in the next elections.  Its support had been going on the decline for years, even more evident after the party lost three of the Gauteng metropolitan municipalities in the 2019 local elections.

You will agree with me that there is no time to play. We have no time to point fingers. We need a disciplined movement and members who will marshal us to victory in 2024,” he said. In acknowledging the decline, Lesufi put up a brave face, telling delegates that despite prophets of doom, the future still looked bright for the liberation movement.  “But we don’t want to be arrogant. We want to accept that we are going through difficulties, and they can be resolved,” he added. He said in the absence of the ANC, the country would be doomed. “We want to ensure that by the time we leave this place, we have an ANC that can deal with our people’s issues and be trusted again. We want an ANC that can make all of us proud.”
