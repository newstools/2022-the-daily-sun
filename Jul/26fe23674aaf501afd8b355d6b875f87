BANYANA Banyana booked their spot in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals following a 1-0 win over Tunisia at Stade Prince Moulay in Rabat on Thursday. Banyana striker Jermaine Seoposenwe scored the most important goal via a cool finish in the 14th minute to secure Desiree Ellis charges a place in next year’s World Cup finals for the second successive time. Banyana will now meet fellow Cosafa neighbours Zambia in the first semi-final at Stade Mohamed V on Monday (6pm, SA time), while host country Morocco will take on defending champions Nigeria in the other last four match at Stade Prince Moulay on the same day at 9pm. The Super Falcons beat Cameroon 1-0 in the other last eight match on Thursday to secure their place in the semi-finals. The four countries have now qualified for the World Cup to be jointly hosted in Australia and New Zealand. Banyana played without their influential striker Thembi Kgatlana who has been ruled out of action for six months due to an Achilles tendon injury she sustained in their 1-0 win over Botswana in their last group match. However, Kgatlana was still in Morocco to rally behind the team instead of returning home to undergo an operation. Tunisia played in the quarterfinals for the first time in their history while Banyana are chasing for their maiden trophy having reached the final on four occasions without luck. Ellis made five changes to the side that beat Botswana as she retained her key players like Refilwe Jane, Noko Matlou, Lebohang Ramalepe and Noxolo Cesane back into her starting line-up. Her counterpart, Samir Landosli made just one surprise change to the side that lost 2-0 to Cameroon in their last match as he replaced his key player Mariem Houij by giving Leila Maknoun a run.
