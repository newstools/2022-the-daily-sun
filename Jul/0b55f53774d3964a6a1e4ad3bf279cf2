SHOPPERS had to duck for cover when thugs suddenly stormed shops in KwaMashu Shopping Centre in KZN. The heavily armed thugs stormed into Spar and Tops at Spar on Saturday, 23 July. They then locked the doors so that nobody could enter or leave while they were inside. Eight of the suspects were inside the shops, while others stood outside the centre’s main entrance. Those who were outside saw a cop van driving into the centre and opened fire, injuring two cops. Those who were inside ransacked all the tills and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash.
