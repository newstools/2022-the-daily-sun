PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa rolled up his sleeves on Monday, 18 July to clean Nelson Mandela Bay water sources. Ramaphosa led the Mandela Day commemoration in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape and in line with the theme of dedicating 67 minutes to conducting good deeds, he cleaned Swartkops River in Veeplaas. He also led a site inspection of the Nooitgedacht Water Treatment Works, which transfers water from the Gariep Dam to the water strained metro. But the metro is facing an unprecedented drought crisis. Ramaphosa said: “It’s wonderful to spend a day side by side with our people cleaning this river. “This is the message to people of Nelson Mandela Bay that they should start taking care of their surroundings. I hope that today we’ve planted a seed that people should start cleaning the city. “We need to work together and select a day maybe in a week or month where we can clean up the city. Ramaphosa was joined by Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane, Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu, Finance and Economic Development MEC Mlungisi Mvoko, and Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Eugene Johnson. Resident Siyabulela Ndoni said: “I am happy that the river has been cleaned. Now that it’s not dirty anymore, we will be able to catch fish. Fishing is our bread and butter as we sell it for an income.”
