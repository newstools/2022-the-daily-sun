A 22-YEAR-OLD woman is in hot water after she opened a false case of rape against her ex-boyfriend at Sydenham cop shop in KZN on Monday, 18 July. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala, the woman told the cops that her ex-boyfriend (28) broke into her house on the night of 17 July and raped her. “She also told the police that the suspect assaulted her and locked her inside her house. “On 19 July, she returned to the Sydenham Police Station to withdraw the case,” Gwala said in a statement. She said the investigating officer interviewed her, however, she failed to provide a reasonable explanation for requesting to withdraw the case.

The ex-boyfriend’s acquaintance reportedly told the cops that his friend was going to leave the woman for someone else and she threatened to open a case of rape against the man if he left her. “When she was confronted with this information, she confessed to the police. She was placed under arrest and detained at Sydenham SAPS for perjury,” Gwala added. The woman appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 20 July for perjury and was released on a warning. The matter was adjourned to 18 August. “This arrest should serve as a warning to others who are contemplating opening a false case. False cases contribute to valuable police resources being wasted and we will ensure that those involved are brought to book,” Gwala said.
