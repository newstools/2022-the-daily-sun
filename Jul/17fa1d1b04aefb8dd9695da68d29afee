UZALO star Nothando Ngcobo said her big wish is landing a job as TV presenter. She said her future ambition makes her ignore the love proposals from men who want to go out with her. "I'm still young in the industry and have big dreams. I don't want to lose focus that's why I ignore all the inboxes on social media of men who want to go out with me," said Nothando. She said her fame, which she gained from playing Hlelo on Uzalo, has attracted attention from men. ALSO READ : Gaming catches up like wild fire in Mzansi! "Some say they find me attractive while others say they find me intelligent. Men say a lot of good things. Well, I choose to ignore because I don't want to find myself in a compromising position. I know what I want and I work hard to get it," said Nothando from Hammarsdale outside Durban. Nothando plays Hlelo who is romantically involved with S'bu (Simphiwe Majozi). She said she enjoys playing the role which has something common with her reality. "Hlelo is a hard working woman who doesn't like things. She is humble and wants only the best for her. I'm like that and I don't want to depend on anyone, that's why I make sure I work hard and am careful not to lose focus," said Nothando.
