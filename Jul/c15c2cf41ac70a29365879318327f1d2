NEW Metro police officers were revealed on Friday, 8 July. A total of 470 new recruits were welcomed by the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department, bringing the total of Metro cops in the municipality to 2 923. Mayor Tania Campbell welcomed the new cops, saying they would help fight lawlessness in the area. The officers recently completed their training at the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Academy in Springs and will be deployed to various parts of Ekurhuleni. During their welcoming event at Boksburg Stadium, the new officers were told to respect the badge and make the city and their families proud. “Your duty is to serve, protect and defend institutions of democracy and the communities of Ekurhuleni,” said Campbell. The new officers started their 18-month training in 2020. An emotional Refilwe Mulusi said she was happy to finally finish training, which ended up taking longer due to Covid-19. “It’s a privilege for me to be part of the Metro police who service the community. Being a cop is a calling, not everyone can be a cop,” she said. “It was discouraging at times and I wanted to give up because we were hurt by the pandemic, but glory be to God. “I’m looking forward to serving the community by not betraying my badge, by being honest and trustworthy,” she said. Parents and relatives came in their big numbers to congratulate the graduates. Parent Moshe Nkadimeng said it was good to see the recruits finishing their training after such a long time. “Our plea to them is to go out there and be the honest cops and respect their uniforms. They must not take bribes. We are tired of corrupt cops in our society,” he said.
