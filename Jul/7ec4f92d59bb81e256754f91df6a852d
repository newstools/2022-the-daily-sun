WHEN neighbours from Amaoti, north of Durban saw that a woman from the area who was pregnant didn’t have a baby, they became suspicious. According to one of the neighbours, on Tuesday they asked the 25-year-old woman about the baby and she told them that the child had died when she gave birth. “We suspected she was lying. We didn’t believe that the baby died just like that. “We live in close vicinity and we know each other very well. So nobody saw her leaving her shack to go to the hospital. And she would have also told some people if she was going to hospital,” she said. She said they then knew that something was fishy.

We took her to the spot where she was digging and asked her to dig up because we realised that she had buried the baby there. Indeed our suspicious were true. She dug up the shallow grave and took out the baby’s body,” she said. Another neighbour said it was a baby boy. She said they believe that she aborted the baby and buried it herself. KZN police spokeswoman Constable Thenjisiwe Ngcobo said Inanda cops were called to Amaoti where the residents reportedly apprehended a 25-year-old woman who was suspected of killing her baby.
