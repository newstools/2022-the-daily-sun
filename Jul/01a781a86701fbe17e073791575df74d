A GROUP of izangoma have qualified and are now ready to heal patients. Dr Nolanga Mokwele said they must make sure they keep their dignity intact. She said they must be clean and do their work professionally. And she reminded them that they must never use human body parts as muthi. The 25 izangoma graduated from the Mhlabuhlangene School of African Medicine. The ceremony was held in Kokstad in the Eastern Cape on Saturday, 23 July. Dr Mokwele saidizangoma were given doctorates and practice numbers. “We’re tired of hearing bad things about traditional healers. “Human flesh cannot be used as muthi to heal. Anyone doing that must be prosecuted. They have also learnt not to use paper to wrap muthi and bottles for the izimbiza must always be clean,” she told Daily Sun. “The graduates have been taught that there are African herbs that don’t mix with Western medicine. With their practice numbers, they’ll now be able to make referrals and write sick notes for their patients.” Dr Nkhensani Tembe, Mhlabuhlangene marketing and advertising strategist, said the izangoma were now recognised just like Western doctors. “Izangoma must follow all the lessons they have learnt at school. They must be trusted by their patients through their good work,” said Tembe. The Mhlabuhlangene School of African Medicine was formed in 1996 to give dignity to izangoma and their work. “There are illnesses that Western doctors can’t treat and the same applies to izangoma. We need to work together and that is why we need to study to empower ourselves,” she said.
