TWO men were killed while sitting in their car at Nyanga Taxi Rank in Cape Town on Wednesday, 27 July. According to onlookers, the attackers walked as if they were just passing by the black Mercedes-Benz before pulling out guns and shooting the men. One tried to run away but was shot at repeatedly and died at the scene. A witness said the victims were from Khayelitsha and could have been in the wrong turf. He said gangs did not allow members from other kasis to hang out in their areas. “This could be an issue of turfs. These guys are from Khayelitsha. “I know them. I think they came to Nyanga and overstayed their welcome,” he said. He said that if they stayed in one spot for too long, it made them an easy target. The car was parked in the same spot for nearly an hour. “The deceased stepped out a few times and came back. “At the time they were shot, they had just come back and sat inside. I suspect whoever did this was monitoring them for some time,” said a vendor. Another witness said the victims were both wearing black gloves. “People thought they were up to something because normally when someone is wearing gloves on a hot day, they don’t want to leave fingerprints.” Cops could not disclose more details as the case was being investigated. Colonel Andre Traut said the deceased were in their 30s. “The motive for the attack is yet to be established. Circumstances are under investigation,” said Traut.
