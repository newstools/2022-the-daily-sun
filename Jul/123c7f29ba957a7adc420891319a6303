PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa must take the nation into his confidence and come clean about his involvement in the alleged Phala Phala farm robbery cover-up. This call was made by the ANC KZN, preparing for its elective conference, to be held on Friday, 22 July, in Durban. The battle for the chairmanship has pitted the premier and outgoing chairman Sihle Zikalala against businessman Sandile Zungu and Finance MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube. Addressing journalists on the state of readiness for the conference, secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said the position taken by the province was that Ramaphosa had an obligation to respond to the allegations.
