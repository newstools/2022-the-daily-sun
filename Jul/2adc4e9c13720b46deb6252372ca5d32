COPS have seized a Lamborghini Aventador after it was spotted speeding at almost three times the speed limit. Canadian cops said the incident happened earlier in the month near Toronto. The local York Regional Police clocked the Italian supercar travelling at 170km/h in a 60km/h zone. It goes without saying that driving at such speed is beyond irresponsible. While the York Regional Police haven’t provided a lot of details about the incident, they did confirm that the Aventador was seized on the scene.
