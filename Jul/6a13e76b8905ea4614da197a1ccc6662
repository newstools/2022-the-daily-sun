FOMER Moretele Local Municipality Municipality Manager Theletsi
Roger Nkhumise (49) made an appearance before the Moretele Regional Court on 15
July 2022, for contravention of the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) in
the appointment of Flame IT Strategy to render ICT services in 2016. It is alleged that the provisions of Regulation 32 of the
Municipal Supply Chain Management Regulations were wrongly deliberately and
unlawfully applied by the Municipal Manager, in that when Moretele Local
Municipality inherited the contract for ICT services from Madibeng Local
Municipality, irregular provision was allegedly made in subsequent Service
Level Agreements for Flame IT Strategy to be appointed for additional work
without following processes.   “The service provider was allegedly appointed without a
competitive bidding process and thereafter the contract was extended deviating
from the prescripts of Regulation 32. Additionally, the pricing for the
contract was allegedly also different from the pricing of the inherited
contract. The service provider was allegedly paid an amount of approximately
R215, 000000-00 in total.” Rikhotso said the accused faces four counts of contravention of
the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) 56 of 2003, read with Regulation 32
of the Municipal Supply Management Regulations.
