THE second leg of the Gauteng ANC conference is set to get underway this Saturday, 9 July. The elective conference was adjourned after the election of the top five leadership but due to time constraints, it did not wrap up. It has been scheduled to continue at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni later today. Nominees for the additional Provincial Executive Committee members are expected to be announced, followed by voting. Two weeks ago, the conference got over the sticky election of the top five leadership where rival factions Adiwele, led by Cooperate Governance MEC Lebogang Maile, and Panya Panya, led by Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, battled out. READ: ANC delegates left high and dry Panyaza emerged victorious, and now has a mountain to climb to regain the lost support of the party ahead of the 2024 general elections. In what was a mixed bag of leadership from the conference, Thembinkosi “TK” Nciza, contesting from Adiwele, was elected provincial secretary, Tasneem Motara deputy secretary, Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko deputy chairwoman and Morakane Mosupyoe treasurer. The conference also saw three women being elected in top five leadership – something that had never been seen before. The first leg was marred by delays, with most proceedings being concluded in the early hours of the morning.
