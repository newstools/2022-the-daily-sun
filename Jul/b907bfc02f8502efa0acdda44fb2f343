NOTHING beats the feeling of being recognised by your own continent! “It is similar to being honoured by your own parents, brothers and sisters,” said Dr Khangelani Sibiya about how he felt when he accepted the Best Edupreneur Award at the Founder of the Year Awards (Foya) held at Nairobi Cinema in Kenya on Thursday, 30 June. The Foya were established to recognise young founders who contribute to the development of the African continent. The three-time Global Teacher Award winner from Mbusowabathethwa Secondary School in Richards Bay, northern KZN, represented Mzansi in the education category. As always, his technique of fusing trending dance moves and lyrics into mathematics and science made him a winner of this award, too. “This award symbolises that Africa is a continent of excellence. I am humbled and extremely grateful for it,” said Sibiya. In his years of teaching, Sibiya has been going the extra mile to help more children love and understand maths and science. “My dream is to have my own maths and science academy where we can help any pupil,” he said.

Please bring our baby Hlelokuhle back! “At the moment we are doing that through our Where To Start centres in different towns in KZN but the big plan is to have a permanent school where pupils can enrol,” said Sibiya. He said currently they are knocking on different doors looking for funding to make their dream a reality. Sibiya won his latest Global Teacher Award in March this year. The founder and the CEO of the Foya, Moranga Innocent, said the journey that started in 2016 continues to create platforms for growth with different African founders. “We must intentionally strive to make sure that we are growing these businesses, companies, our lives, the lives of our employees and the people around us,” said Moranga.
