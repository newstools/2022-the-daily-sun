NEWLY-elected Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) chairman Panyaza Lesufi assured party members who didn’t make it to the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) that their jobs were safe. At Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Lesufi called for unity. He told delegates preparations for the 2024 elections should start now. Lesufi said all ANC branches and structures should be converted into election structures to prepare the party to take its rightful place by winning back the trust of the people. He said the province’s newly elected leadership should unite and lead the campaign and those who didn’t make it into additional members should be accommodated. “No one won in this conference, no one lost in this conference, the ANC is victorious. We come out of this conference as one formation, we come of this conference as one organisation. As we leave this conference, we also officially declare that no one will be purged or removed from their work stations as councillors or public representatives purely because their democratic choice did not prevail in this conference.” MECs such as Faith Mazibuko and former Joburg mayor Parks Tau, didn’t make the PEC. Former provincial secretary Jacob Khawe was another big loser, but sacked health MEC Bandile Masuku made the cut, despite the PPE saga. Lesufi said the current governance by coalition parties in Gauteng was shaky and the governing party should go all out to win them back. He identified three areas for the PEC to focus on: electricity, the election campaign and building a capable state that will deliver services to the masses. In closing the conference, party treasurer Paul Mashatile also called for unity.
