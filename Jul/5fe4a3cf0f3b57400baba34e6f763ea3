POLICE are investigating an inquest case after the horrific discovery of a human skeleton in the field in Hekpoort farm in Delmas, Mpumalanga, on Thursday, 28 July. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said cops were informed about the discovery, made by a resident who was collecting wood. “Upon arrival, officers confirmed that the bones belonged to a human being and noticed two small holes in the skull, suggesting the possibility of the victim having been shot,” he said. Mohlala added that they also discovered two cable ties attached to the bones, showing that the victim could have been tied up. “Other items found include a black jacket and trousers, but they were torn. The gender has not yet been determined, and police cannot rule out the possibility of the charge being changed to murder,” he said. Police have urged anyone with information regarding the discovery or anyone looking for a missing loved one to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or send a tip-off via MySAPS app.
