TRIPLE murder accused Pontsho Mohlanka’s ex-partner on Monday, 25 July told the court how the body of the missing Mzwandile Zitho (7) was found. The ex-partner, who is under witness protection, said they found the body stuck between the tavern fridge and the counter. The 32-year-old said on the day the body was found, he was outside with his friend drinking whisky. He said he asked a child to tell Pontsho to give them some mix for the whisky. “The boy came back and said Pontsho was calling me. Then she appeared from the main house and called me to check something at the tavern.” He said she pointed in the direction of the counter. “At that time I knew they were searching for Mzwandile,” he said. “When I saw Mzwandile, I shouted at him and said they were looking for him. The reason I shouted is that he was between the fridge and the counter, with his head on the counter.” After the matter was reported to the cops, the lover was arrested but was released four days later on 20 April 2020, while Pontsho remained in prison. He said he moved to KZN and sold the tavern and house, and hasn’t set foot in the house since. Pontsho is also accused of being involved in the murders of Simphiwe Mgcina (6) and Mpho Makondo (8). The ex-partner was testifying at the High Court sitting in Palm Ridge, where Pontsho’s trial entered its second week. The matter continues today.
