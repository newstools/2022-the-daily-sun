RESIDENTS walk longer distances to get home after work and kids are told to play inside the yard. All this is happening just to avoid the terror of a dog that was roaming the streets of Alexandra, Joburg. Residents told Daily Sun they’d tried to speak to the owner but he wouldn’t listen. They’d also tried calling the SPCA but for the past three months, but they haven’t come. Mandla Mabena (41) said the dog almost bit him two weeks ago when he was on his way to work. He said he was saved by a madala who threw stones at the dog. “I had just moved here. I had no idea there was a dog terrorising the residents.” He said he started using a longer route. “I saw the owner a few days ago but when I spoke to him he showed no interest. He just walked away,” said Mandla. Matlakala Modiselle (32) said she and her daughter now had to take a longer route which has changed their morning routine. Daily Sun spoke to SPCA spokesman Jerry Selwane, who said he was not aware of the problem. He promised to intervene. He said he’d get the Department of Health to work with him on the matter. The dog owner refused to talk to the SunTeam.
