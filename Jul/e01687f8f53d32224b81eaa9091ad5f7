MEN who fix tyres next to Lansdowne Electricity Depot in Gugulethu, Western Cape had to run for cover after a taxi driver was killed at their workplace. One of the men told Daily Sun the victim came to their place to fix the tyres of his vehicle and a few minutes later, two people parked their vehicle there as well. One of the men apparently walked to the taximan, who was talking on the phone, shot him in the head and then fled the scene. “It’s scary because we were just doing our job as usual and all of a sudden, our client is murdered before our eyes. We had to scurry for cover,” said the man. The taxi the dead man was driving had Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) markings. Cata spokesman Nkululeko Sityebi said he was aware of the incident. “We heard about the shooting, but are not yet sure about the motive of the killing. But at the moment, we don’t have any infighting in our organisation. It could have been a robbery or anything, but we’e going to investigate to find out the cause of the shooting. We will do that when we are on the ground because at the moment, the leadership of Cata is in Eastern Cape where we had a meeting.” Sityebi called on the cops to get to the bottom of the murder. “We also want cops to do their job and bring the perpetrators to book,” said Sityebi. Sergeant Wesley Twigg confirmed the incident. “According to reports, Gugulethu police were called to the crime scene where they found the victim with gunshot wounds to the head and neck. The victim was declared dead on the scene by paramedics. A murder case was registered for investigation. The suspect/s fled the scene and are yet to be arrested. The motive is yet to be established. Anyone with any information about this incident should contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111,” he said.
