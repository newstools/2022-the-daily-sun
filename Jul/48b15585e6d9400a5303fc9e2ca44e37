THE number of people killed during the Mdlalose Tavern shooting early on Sunday morning, 10 July in Lahlumlenze in Orlando East, Soweto, has risen to 15. This comes after a group of heavily armed men stormed the tavern and opened fire on patrons who were having a good time. Eight people are still in hospital, two of them in a critical condition. Gauteng provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela said it happened during operational hours.  “What we know is the assailants just entered that space while people were enjoying themselves. As to what is the motive, currently we don’t know but our detectives are hard at work, led by my deputy here, Major General Mbuso Khumalo. “We have assembled a group of detectives, an integrated one supported by experts from crime scene management, working around the clock.”  Mawela said their intelligence community was also deployed to collect information from witnesses to assist the police to crack this case.

Indeed, we send our condolences to the families that have been affected.  “What saddens me is in Gauteng we’ve now seen a proliferation of guns and it saddens us that anyone now who possesses a gun wants to try their guns on our communities. “We wish to call upon communities to really assist the police in bringing to book those perpetrators and if they have information on these Toyota Quantums,” said Mazibuko.
