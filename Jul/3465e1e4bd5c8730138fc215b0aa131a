A MPUMALANGA family hoped for a better future, but cruel thugs shattered their hopes. Their loved one, Mthunzi Wiseman Zwane, a student doctor, was stabbed to death on Saturday, 2 July. The 26-year-old from Elukwatini, Mpumalanga was last seen on Saturday. His body was found on Wednesday, 6 July in a river at Elukwatani, not far from his home. This after the family and community launched a search. His sister Nqobile said Mthunzi was stabbed 16 times. “We are very hurt by what happened. My brother had a bright future. He had big plans for the family and he always assured me he was going to make our lives better. We have suffered a great loss. All the plans he had are gone.” Mthunzi only had six months of studies to go until he was to graduate in November. Nqobile said: “I would have accepted his death if he died in a car accident, but I am now struggling to process everything. “My brother was never a violent person. He was always laughing. I don’t know why he was killed, but I suspect jealousy.” Her only wish was for the law to take its course so she could find closure. Resident Xolani Nkosi said the community lived in fear because of gangsterism. He said another young man was also brutally killed by members of a gang last week. Two male suspects, aged between 17 and 18, have been arrested for Mthunzi’s murder. Colonel Donald Mdluli said the 17-year-old is in hospital after residents assaulted him. “The two were arrested on Friday and police are still looking for other suspects. The investigation continues,” he said.
