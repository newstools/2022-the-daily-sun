SUSPENDED National Union of Metal Workers of SA (Numsa) second deputy president, Ruth Ntlokotse and other members, are going to court to challenge their suspensions. The case could have a negative impact on the union’s national congress, scheduled to start on Monday, 25 July. The case will be heard in the Labour Court on Friday, 22 July, where the suspended members hope their suspensions would be lifted. In a statement released on Thursday, 21 July, Ntlokotse said they were going to court on the basis that the suspensions were unconstitutional. “Failing the lifting of the suspensions, we’re asking the court to rule that the Numsa National Congress, scheduled to start on Monday, can’t go ahead.” She said the constitution required that the central committee appoints a credentials committee to accredit delegates to the national congress.

She said the number of members banned from attending the congress has now risen to 54 from initial 30. Ntlokotse, who is also president of the South African Federation of Trade Unions, was suspended last week for allegedly sowing division in the union and acting outside of the leadership collective.
