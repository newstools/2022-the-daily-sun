SECURITY guards stand at the clinic entrance to check patients. But residents are now angry, claiming the guards are hostile and decide who gets in and who doesn’t. Speaking to Daily Sun, residents of Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni said they didn’t want bouncers outside of Phillip Moyo Clinic. They said they were no longer free to visit the clinic because of the bad treatment they received. “There are so many things that we’re not happy with at the clinic, but the security guards treating us badly is unacceptable. “They run the clinic as if they own it. We don’t want bouncers at the clinic,” said a resident. Boitumelo Leshilo said the behaviour of the security guards had led to some patients no longer going to the clinic to collect their chronic medication. ALSO READ |
Drunken mayor crashes car “They should go practise their bouncing skills at the tavern and not in the clinic,” said another gatvol resident. “I don’t go to that clinic any more because the guards make us feel unwanted. It’s sad because some of us are on chronic medication.” A patient told Daily Sun they complained to the management of the clinic, but were referred to the municipality. “We are taxpayers and we shouldn’t be afraid to use our facilities because of individuals,” said the resident. Municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini promised that the matter will be investigated.
