LICHTENBURG cops in North West are investigating a case of murder after the body of a two-year-old boy was found in a shallow grave on Tuesday, 5 June. Neo Refemetswe Tlhame went missing on 24 May while he was with his grandparents. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani, the boy’s disappearance was established by his mother when she went to fetch him after work. “Subsequent to the fruitless search by the community members and Neo’s family, a missing person’s inquiry was opened for investigation. Police also joined the search, but Neo was never found,” Funani said. She said cops were called by his mother after they spotted a suspicious grave near the river. “The grave was dug out and Neo’s decomposed body was identified with the clothes that he was wearing on the day of his disappearance.” Funani said the cause of death was still unknown and no one had been arrested.
