DSTV Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns have been invited to participate in the Prince Mangosuthu Legacy Cup in KwaZulu-Natal on 23 July. The pre-season tournament will feature Sundowns,  AmaZulu, newly promoted Premiership side Richards Bay and the squad from the King Cetshwayo District. Downs previously featured in this tournament in 2018, where they defeated AmaZulu in the final. That was the last time this competition was played. The competition is named after former IFP leader and struggle icon Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi and will be played at Ulundi Stadium. Richards Bay are delighted to be playing in this competition and to have the chance of facing  Sundowns and AmaZulu to test their squads. Bay have signed 10 new players in order not to just make up the numbers in their first season in the top flight and the newcomers are expected to get a run out in this KZN tourney. Sundowns who have won the league for the past five seasons could give new signing from SuperSport United Sipho Mbule some game time with his new teammates. AmaZulu have bolstered their squad with the signings of Thendo Mukumela, Veluyeke Zulu, Riaan Hanamub, Dumisani Zuma, Augustine Mulenga, Gabadinho Mhango, Rally Bwalya, Ethan Brooks and George Maluleka.
