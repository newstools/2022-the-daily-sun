GABADINHO Mhango was one of the penalty scorers as AmaZulu beat Zululand XI 4-3 in the Prince Mangosuthu Legacy Cup at Ulundi Stadium on Saturday. The game had finished 1-1 and went straight to penalty and that is when guys like Bongi Ntuli, Mhango, Thembela Sikhakhane and Tercious Malepe all converted. Keagan Buchanan was the only one who saw his spot kick saved. Usuthu will now face either defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns or Richards Bay in the semi final, which is starting at 12pm. In this friendly match, AmaZulu coach Brandon Truter went with a 4-3-3 formation with Joel Amonome in goals, with back four paired by Malepe, new signing Veluyeke Zulu, Samkelo Mgwazela and Sikhakhane. In the midfield, it was Matarr Ceesay, Butho Ncube and Buchanan, who was initially the captain of the side. The front three was all new signings – Mhango, Dumisani Zulu and Augustine Kwem. While that front three looks good and can beat any side in the DStv Premiership, they struggled to penetrate Zululand XI. Instead it was Zululand XI which went ahead in the first half with Kwandakwethu Mqadi finding the back of the net with a looping header to stun Usuthu in the first half. However, Usuthu got the penalty in the second half when Msindisi Ndlovu, who was on loan at Uthongathi last season, was brought down. Bongi Ntuli, who was hampered by injuries last season, cheekily converted the penalty. Ntuli had come on for Kwem, who struggled to get going in the match.
