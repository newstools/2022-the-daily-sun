A 44-YEAR-OLD Delft woman is gatvol after she was bitten by her neighbour’s pit bull in April. And what made her even more angry is that the neighbour didn’t care after the dog almost broke her leg. Now the woman wants the makhi to cough up R10 000 for the pain she suffered from the dog bite. The woman alleged that a 15-year-old girl, the child of the dog’s owner, just watched as she screamed for help while the pit bull locked its teeth into her leg. “When the dog owner came back from work, she came to see me. I told her what happened. “She took me to the clinic in her car and gave me R50 to take a taxi back home after I was treated. ALSO READ |

How did she expect me to take a taxi at night while I was in pain?” she said. The woman said the makhi only came to her house three days later and brought some fruit for her. She told Daily Sun she paid a lot of money for her trips to the clinic and could not work because of the pain that kept her home for two months. She said on the said day, she was walking past her neighbour’s house when the pit bull attacked her. “When I tried to run, it had already sunk its teeth in my leg and I fell to the ground,” she said. The woman said the dog owner didn’t care about her after the attack. “I confronted her but she seemed unbothered. I then opened a case against her.” The pit bull owner refused to speak to the SunTeam. ALSO READ |

The victim said police called the dog owner to the cop shop, but she went back to her house the same day. She said the police told her to try to claim the money through the Small Claims Court as they couldn’t force the person to pay her. Police spokesman Warrant Office Joseph Swartbooi said cops are investigating the matter.
