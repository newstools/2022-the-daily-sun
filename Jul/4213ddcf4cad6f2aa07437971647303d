According to sources, the fire started in the administration block before spreading to other buildings. Parents, Bongiwe Vilakazi (37) and Thembi Mkhwanazi (43), said they were devastated the school was destroyed. “It is towards the end of the year and a time for our children to review their capabilities. “We know government things take long. Maybe the provincial Department of Education will organise a temporary structure to allow teaching and learning to flow smoothly regardless of the situation,” Thembi said. Free State education MEC Dr Tate Makgoe said this was a devastating tragedy. “This left 1 050 learners and 31 teachers without a school to attend. The fire destroyed the entire admin block and 23 out of the 25 classrooms. “The school furniture, computers, learner support materials and other critical documents were also destroyed by this inferno. “This is excruciatingly hurtful given the fact that we don’t have enough schools in this area. This incident is taking us back as we will be required to rebuild another school and funds are not readily available,” said Makgoe. He confirmed that in the meantime, pupils will be accommodated at two local secondary schools. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said an inquiry was registered at Thembelihle cop shop for further investigation. The cause of fire is still unknown.
