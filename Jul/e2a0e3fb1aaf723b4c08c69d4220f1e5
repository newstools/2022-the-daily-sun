VILLAGERS claim he was stealing their livestock for years. They then set up a trap to catch him. Seeing that he was cornered, he fled but while fleeing, he crashed into a fence and the registration plate of his bakkie got ripped off. And it was the number plate that bust him. Today he’s behind bars and villagers got their livestock back. Lucky Bambo, liaison officer for Kgotho Community Safety Forum, said the stock theft has affected the livelihood of many families. “These thugs emptied many kraals and left villagers destitute,” said Bambo. “He said at the time the ringleader was cornered, it was on his farm in Limburg.” “He had a load of goats and he offloaded them and when he saw us, he fled,” said Bambo. He said many owners have died of the broken hearts. “Many villagers would wake up to find their kraals empty, some having lost 30 to 40 of their livestock.” Bambo said villagers tried to involve the police, but nothing helped until they stood up for themselves. They have now started a stock theft watch groups under Kgotho Community Safety Forum to hunt down the thieves. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo of Limpopo police confirmed cases open and the arrest made.
