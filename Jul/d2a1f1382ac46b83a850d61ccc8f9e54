THE Congress of the People (Cope) has laid a charge of money laundering and corruption against former state security minister David Mahlobo. The case was opened at Lyttelton Police Station in Centurion, Tshwane, on Monday 4 June. Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem said they decided to lay the charges based on information contained in the state capture report, released on 22 June by Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. He said the commission found that Mahlobo not only involved himself in State Security Agency (SSA) operations but directed them. “One of his responses during the commission was that the law did not prohibit him from getting involved,” said Bloem. He said the report found what was more worrying was his involvement in withdrawing, handling and distributing large amounts of money. Bloem said the commission found that large amounts of cash were delivered to Mahlobo on several occasions. “Justice Zondo said preliminary evidence given about the SSA indicated gross non-compliance with operational and financial directives, especially in establishment of covert projects and creation of special purpose vehicles to siphon funds,” he said. He said the report also revealed that Mahlobo allegedly delivered money in cash to former president Jacob Zuma.
