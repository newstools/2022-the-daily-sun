IT SEEMS like social media streets will never rest, with celebrities often fighting with each other. And the latest to join this trend is reality TV star and club host Inno Morolong, who came for singer Makhadzi, accusing her of being a no-show and not paying back her booking fee for a gig at the Dundee July this past weekend. Makhadzi is in Canada on the first stop of her international tour. And instead of fully taking in the tour and enjoying herself, she ended up on Instagram live on a rampage against a troll to address the matter with her fellow friend and musician, Zanda Zakuza. In the live, she said: “My life is a movie because of people’s support. They buy my music and promoters book me every weekend. And for those who book me and I don’t pitch, obviously I don’t plan on not coming – it just means something came up and we have to refund them. Stop dimming my light. I still want to shine and I am working hard.” Makhadzi also ended up addressing Inno directly. ALSO READ : Dineo Langa dumps The Estate! “We don’t do lipos [liposuction] to get money. We go out and perform. And if that works for you, don’t disturb our peace,” she said. Now, the two personalities are in a full-blown feud as Inno responded to Makhadzi, calling her a “ghetto musician” and saying that hers was tavern music.  “I’m going live tomorrow to address this ghetto artist that’s body-shaming people who had surgery and claiming that people are jealous of her. Honey, how? We don’t know you and we don’t care who you are. Your songs play at taverns and taxi ranks, not high-class clubs and events I host,” she concluded.
