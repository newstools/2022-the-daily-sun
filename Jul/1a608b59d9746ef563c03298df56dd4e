Former Nigeria goalkeeper Greg Etafia’s son Kevin has joined Cape Town Spurs. Unlike his father, Kevin is centre-back and can also play at left-back. Kevin Etafia will be under the watchful eye of former Bafana Bafana striker Shaun Bartlett, who is coaching the Mother City club in the Motsepe Foundation Championship. Etafia senior, who is now a goalkeeper coach of TS Galaxy, is a proud dad about his son taking his first step in professional football. “Thanks to Cape Town Spurs and Shaun Bartlett for the opportunity,” Etafia told SunSport. “I’m happy for him and of course.” Etafia arrived in South Africa from Nigeria to join Moroka Swallows in 2003. In a career that ended in 2015 when the Birds were relegated Etafia won three trophies, which include Absa Cup in 2004, Nedbank Cup in 2009 and MTN8 in the 2012-13 season. Etafia retired with over 300 matches under his belt. He was then appointed as the club’s interim coach, but he was only in charge of three matches in the National First Division now renamed the Motsepe Foundation Championship. He came out of retirement joining Highlands Park in the 2019-20 season, but he was only on the bench three times and never made any appearances. Etafia played in four international matches for Nigeria. He made his Super Eagles debut in March 2003 against Japan with Nigeria losing 3-0 at home. He was part of Nigeria's squad in the Africa Cup of Nations in 2004 in Tunisia, winning the bronze medal that year.
