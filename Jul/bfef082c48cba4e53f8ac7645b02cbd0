WHEN Advocate Malesela Teffo agreed to represent four of five accused in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial, the family gained hope of knowing the truth about what happened in 2014. Teffo had also given the family a glimpse of hope in finding closure. But now that he has dramatically withdrawn from the case, the family is sadly left with nothing and no one to place their hope to, except God. In a dramatical twist, Teffo announced his withdrawal after Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela dismissed the letter of accused number three Mthobisi Prince Mncube, which was read in court, levelling the horrific conditions he was allegedly living under at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre in Tshwane. “I will no longer be able to proceed in this court based on the harassment I’m receiving from the state and court,” said Teffo. But his withdrawal is the stumbling block between the truth and hope of ever witnessing justice prevailing. Senzo’s brother, Sifiso Meyiwa, said God would answer their prayers. “The family has suffered a lot since the murder. As a man of God and a praying family, we have faith that God will perform His miracles. One day, the truth will be revealed. I declare that God will prove His powers. He is the only one that we put our hope to,” he said. Senzo’s sister Zama Meyiwa said: “I don’t know what to say. Teffo tried his best. But for now, I’m out of words.” When Teffo was contacted by Daily Sun, he said the Meyiwa family should not worry. “I’m in constant communication with the family, especially Sifiso. The fact that I have withdrawn doesn’t mean I’m completely not there. I’m still there. Remember that I have another attorney in court. So the family must not lose hope,” said Teffo.
