POLYGAMIST Musa Mseleku has lambasted his critics. Following the latest episode of Mzansi Magic’s Mnakwethu, he was accused of being insensitive and disrespectful towards women. During the episode, he was tasked with helping Qinisela Xaba, who wants to take Thobile Zondi as his second wife. Qinisela said he was cheating on his wife Silindile Miya and was tired of sneaking around and that’s why he wanted to marry Thobile. What angered many viewers was that Silindile started crying as soon as Musa walked in. Pain and disappointment were written all over her face. “I was deeply hurt because I knew he’d come to tell me about polygamy. I don’t want a sister wife,” a teary Silindile said on the show. Qinisela insisted he had the final say and would take a second wife, which angered many women. Speaking to Daily Sun, Musa said: “I understand the pain that I bring to these women and it is worse when the husband wants to take the girlfriend as a second wife. “However, my job is to reveal the secret to the wife. In most cases, the wife is not ready for it. This is because most women think their husbands or partners are different from other men until I come and introduce the girlfriend as the incoming wife.” Musa said women hated him for telling the truth about their husbands. “The anger must be directed to these men who introduce their girlfriends to their wives. I understand that polygamy is not yet a normal practice but a debate has already started and it’s a good and healthy debate,” he said. The SunTeam spoke to Qinisela, who said: “I’ve discussed this with my wife. At the moment, we’re not ready to talk about it.” Shirley Adonisi, director of local entertainment channels for M-Net, said the broadcaster strived to make content that reflected South African society.
