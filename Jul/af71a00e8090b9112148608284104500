A FUNERAL service in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, ended in tragedy on Saturday, 2 July, when a house caught fire. Two neighbours are still reeling in shock after the fire claimed the life of Olwethu Tshabalala (10) while her friend Sinithemba Nkomonde (11) suffered minor injuries. The Nkomonde family was burying a relative. But a few hours later, Olwethu died in their backroom that had caught fire due to a suspected electrical fault. The family said some social media reports accused them of negligence. “The reports said we left the kids alone to go and party. How can we go partying when we had a funeral earlier?” asked homeowner Dolly Nkomonde. ALSO READ | Facebook MJOLO ends in mkhukhu tears! “We were forced to sleep early because of load shedding. The rumours are hurtful. “We are saddened that my neighbour’s child died in the fire,” she said.  Dolly said her granddaughter, Sinethemba, managed to get out of the burning house to knock for them to save Olwethu. She was eventually dragged out, but died later due to smoke inhalation. Olwethu’s father, Lucas Maseko, said they were devastated. Sergeant Harry Manaka of Duduza Police Station said an inquest was opened for investigation.
