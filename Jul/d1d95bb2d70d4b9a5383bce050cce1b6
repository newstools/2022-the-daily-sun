SHE lives with her drug addicted son, whom she says has turned into a monster. This is because the 19-year-old chases her with a knife and threatens to kill her whenever he is high. As a result, Conny Seema (41) from Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni has run away from her house for her own safety. “I’m forced to sleep at my neighbour’s house when he is high,” said the desperate mum. She said her son also takes fresh food from the fridge and throws it in the dustbin. “I’m not supposed to say anything,” she said. Conny said all this time, her son was well-behaved. “The problem started when his friends introduced him to crystal meth. “He became wild, demanded money from me and threatened to kill me,” she said. She said her son stormed into her bedroom while she was bathing last week and he had a knife. “He wanted to stab me, but we fought over the knife. “I pushed him away from me and screamed for help,” said Conny. She said she was saved by neighbours. “I don’t know what to do anymore. “I tried to involve the police and social workers but he refuses to go to a rehabilitation centre.” Conny said she even had to sleep at her neighbour’s this past weekend. She said she opened a case at Etwatwa cop shop and her son was arrested in May. He told his mum that he will change and go back to school. But he went back to his old ways after he was released. Conny has now opened a protection order against him. Daily Sun asked the son if he wanted to go to rehab and he said he will think about it. Gauteng social development said to get help, the son must be willing to go to rehab.
