A LIMPOPO TVET college lecturer was burnt to death after residents caught him with suspected stolen goats on Saturday, 2 July. Police described the attack, which happened in Lebowakgomo, as barbaric and locals strongly condemned the murder. Limpopo police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Mamphaswa Seabi: “The deceased was reportedly driving his motor vehicle in possession of an unknown number of goats that he bought at Mamaolo in Ga-Mphahlele Village. “Unexpectedly, the victim’s vehicle was stopped by a mob who pulled him outside of his car. “Afterwards, the victim was severely assaulted and burnt to death together with his motor vehicle after being suspected of stock theft.” Seabi said police were summoned to the scene and upon their arrival, they found a burnt-out bakkie and the victim lying a few metres away. The suspected stolen goats were not found on the crime scene. “The deceased is originally from KZN and was a resident in Lebowakgomo zone A. “Members of the community are cautioned not to take the law into their own hands, but rather hand over the suspects to the police for further investigation and prosecution.” Seabi said a manhunt has been launched for the suspects. Anyone with information that can lead to the suspects’ arrest should call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
