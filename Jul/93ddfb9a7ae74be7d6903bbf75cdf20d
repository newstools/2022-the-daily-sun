THE Presidency has described accusations by Advocate
Malesela Teffo against it as mischievous and harmful to the standing of the
office of the president. Teffo, who withdrew from being the counsel for four of the
five accused in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial, made claims that the office was
part of the alleged plan to pin the crime to the five men. Teffo, on Tuesday, said he was withdrawing as defence
counsel as he was being harassed. He told the North Gauteng High Court that he was quitting
because of the harassment he claimed to have been subjected to by Judge
Tshifhiwa Maumela, the police and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Spokesman Vincent Ngwenya said they had noted and strongly
refuted the false claims by Teffo that the Presidency was behind his alleged
intimidation. and subsequent decision to withdraw from the trial. He said the Presidency found these claims unsubstantiated
and baseless. “The Presidency does not participate in criminal
investigations or trials, and is not involved in any perceived or actual
harassment of Teffo. As an officer of the court and a professional in the legal
fraternity, Teffo must appreciate the level of veracity that is necessary to
support such claims about any institution or individual,” he said. Ngwenya added that the Presidency respected the values of
the Constitution and cherished the protection, safety and justice of all.
