WITH petrol prices rising, commuters are really feeling the pinch. They said some taxi associations were now taking advantage of the situation and increasing fares to ridiculous amounts. Commuters from Everest squatter camp and Payneville in Springs, Ekurhuleni, said they were being charged R14 for a four-minute ride. They said fares had become ridiculous and they were now appealing for amaphela (sedan) taxis to take over. They said most residents had started walking to town, as it was close enough. Cornelius Ntoagae said: “We pay almost the same amount as someone going to Brakpan. This is crazy. I sometimes use a car and it’s only four minutes to get to town. I’m wondering why these taxis are overcharging us.” Evelyn Dube said the taxi associations were taking chances. “They should not hide behind the high petrol price. We have been overcharged all along but now it is too much,” she said. Emmanuel Shelembe said the situation was getting crazy. “We appeal to the authorities to regulate taxi prices in Springs,” he said. Another resident said they had already been let down by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa. “There are railway lines near our homes and if the trains were well run, we would not fall prey to greedy taxi operators,” said the resident. Tebogo Kereeditse said the taxi owners were feeling the consequences. “I’m sure these greedy taxi owners are also feeling the pinch as most people are walking. “Let them keep their taxis and we will keep our money,” said Tebogo. Springs Taxi Association chairman Leonard Molo said people never to speak to them before going to the media. “It would be better if they came to us and see how we can resolve the matter.”
