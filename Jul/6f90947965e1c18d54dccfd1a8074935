“I CAN rot in jail for all I care but at the end of the day, the truth will come out.” These were the words of murder accused, Sipho Mkhatshwa, when he appeared in the Mbombela Magistrates Court for his bail application yesterday, 25 July. The 39-year-old is facing charges of rape, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, as well as defeating the ends of justice. He was arrested in May after the body of Hillary Gardee was found dumped in a timber plantation outside of Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Gardee was reported missing in April after she was last seen at a shopping complex. Mkhatshwa claims police gave him the option to turn state witness. He said he was told four people arrested in Gauteng linked him to the murder. “I rejected the offer. I won’t witness something I did not know. “I told them I am not interested in their thing. “I can rot in jail for all I care but at the end of the day, the truth will come out,” he said. He said he was transferred to the maximum security prison in Barberton, where he was tortured. “That’s the punishment for me not having co-operated with their offer to turn me into a state witness,” he said. Mkhatshwa’s wife also took to the stand and told the court how she gave birth prematurely because of stress, and how her kids had to attend counselling as they were traumatised by seeing their father get arrested. “I now have to go to a psychiatric hospital and there will be no one to look after my kids,” she said The matter was rolled over to today, 26 July.
