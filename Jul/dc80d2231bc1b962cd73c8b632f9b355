UNAKHO Kewana (18) still has her lifelong dreams to fulfil, but she may die because of load shedding. Unakho from East London has been in and out of hospital because of a condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She told Daily Sun she lives with the condition that has resulted in her being dependent on an oxygen supply. She said this started in 2019 and it keeps getting worse as more power cuts are implemented. When she doesn’t have electricity, she has to go somewhere where there is a generator or solar power. “I am dependent on other people to save my life. It is really challenging. I need all the help I can get,” she said. She said she only gets a limited amount of oxygen from the cylinder, making it very painful for her to breathe. Unakho’s mum was diagnosed with a stroke in 2016 and their only source of income is a disability grant. ALSO READ |
‘My wife has sex with a tokoloshe’ She’s asking SunReaders to assist her in buying a generator or a solar panel to ensure that she doesn’t lose her life. She said she still has big dreams and it scares her to be this sick. Unakho shared her situation on social media and Mzansi has been showing her love and compassion. Luyanda Mtyeku suggested that people pledge R100 each and offered to get quotations for a generator.  “Let’s do this together so we can put a smile on this young girl’s face. I pledge my R100,” she said. Nikiwe Xhegwana said she’s sad to see a young girl faced with such problems. “It’s annoying to see how Eskom is toying with people’s lives,” said Nikiwe.
