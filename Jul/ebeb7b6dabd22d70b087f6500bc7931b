THE Western Cape Human Settlements Department has ordered a woman to vacate her RDP house. This after she sold it barely three years after receiving it from the department. Human Settlements MEC Tertius Simmers said the sale of the free and subsided house was unlawful and the beneficiary was warned not to sell it, but she did not listen. Simmers said earlier this year, he heard about people selling their homes and he visited the area to verify.

According to the agreement of sale between the department and beneficiaries, the house cannot be sold within the first eight years without first offering the property to the department in terms of Section 10A of the Housing Act. Simmers said the woman was discouraged from selling the house, but she went ahead and sold it for R450 000. He said those who illegally bought the house would have to institute civil action against those who sold the house to them.
