YOUNG women, between ages 16 and 28, will get a chance during Mandela Month to be involved in the economy and become CEOs of their own lives. GirlBoss SA’s Sindi Anikwa Khathwane said they were launching the Sebenza Girl campaign under the theme – Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. “We chose to launch the campaign during Mandela Month because we are working towards equal access to opportunities for all,” Sindi told Daily Sun. “When we participate in the economy, we can plan and build on important things such as food security and nation building.” Sindi said that they had spoken to various partners in the past two weeks, and were humbled by how many organisations were doing this important work. “We’re inviting the private and public sectors to join forces with us to offer solutions to address youth unemployment. We can’t all start businesses, but we can learn the skills that can help us make something out of what we already know,” she said. She said they had succeeded in the approach through Ignition Camps, that they have done with Sunrise Academy in South Africa, Eswatini and Nigeria. “We have different partners that workshop the girls on nature using permaculture principles,” she said. Sindi said they used tools for inner alignment, including golf and art. Through GirlBoss, they did empowerment through the Bossing It Up presentation and toolkit. “The campaign seeks to bring organisations together in support of our youth.”
