FORMER ANC member of Parliament, Vincent Smith, briefly appeared in the Palmridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on charges of tax fraud and corruption on Tuesday, 5 July. The matter was postponed to August for a High Court date. The charge against Smith and his company Euroblitz stem from a failure to disclose taxable income from 09 March 2009 and 11 July 2018, totalling R28 million. The former standing committee on public accounts chairman stands accused in his capacity as well as representative capacity for his company Euroblitz 48 Pty Ltd. It is alleged that he received gratifications from Bosasa in the form of security upgrades to his home in Gauteng, cash payments and other services valued at around R870 000 Smith has pleaded not guilty and told the court that the money was a loan from former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi. The state has had assets belonging to him and his family, worth R46m, frozen pending the finalisation of his trial. Smith was charged together with former Agrizzi but their trials have since been separated due to Agrizzi failing to appear in court on many occasions because of ill health.
