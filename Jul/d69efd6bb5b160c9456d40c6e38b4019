FANS were left worrying after Ndivhudzannyi “Makhadzi” Ralivhona had an accident on stage. The singer bumped her head on a speaker while performing her hit song Ghanama in Swaziland on Saturday 2 July. In a video of the incident, Makhadzi can be seen throwing herself on to the floor and then bumping her head on the speaker. One of her dancers then rushes to help her get up. Makhadzi later took to Facebook to explain the following day. “Aaa wee. Apologies for all the gigs I had today, unfortunately I had a mini incident at a performance last night where I hit my head hard on a speaker as per the video attached below,” she wrote.

By tomorrow, I should be able to resume work.” Open Mic managing director Nkateko Maluleke said Makhadzi didn’t realise there wasn’t enough space behind her. “As she was dancing, she threw herself to the floor as part of her performance and that was when she bumped her head,” he said. “She was medically examined and she’s now fine. She is back at work.” Since Sunday evening, her fans have been wishing her well. Eleezabeth Tete Mampane said: “I think you should rest the whole week. Ahhh be gentle on yourself, get some rest sisi. Please take yourself to the spa and get a full-body massage.” Percy Rethabile Lebogo commented: “Khadzi we love you, get well soon, but I don’t support your dance. Won’t that affect you in a way?” Thuto Moqeti said: “Askies khadzi. You should take care because a head injury is dangerous indeed. You might even experience internal bleeding without noticing.”
