WHEELCHAIR-BOUND gogo Mndazi Dube has a proper roof over her head. On Friday, she got a fully furnished RDP house from the Department of Human Settlements. MEC Speedy Mashilo officially handed it over. Gogo Mndazi (73) said her prayers have been answered after struggling to get a house for a long time. The gogo from Nhlazatshe in Mpumalanga lives with her three grandkids. She told Daily Sun people around her got houses, leaving her worried. “I tried many times but failed. God answered my prayers. I never wanted to die in a shack. I am going to sleep peacefully. “I have been living in a shack for 25 years, enduring all kinds of weather. The shack was leaking. It was always engulfed by dust and I was scared of getting sick,”she said. Mashilo said the house was long overdue to gogo Mndazi, and his department always put the elderly first. “It’ the mandate to make sure citizens have proper roofs over their heads. Old people, child-headed families and people with disabilities are a priority. Handing over the house to gogo during Mandela Month is a blessing. She’s clearly indigent and as a department, we need to pull up our socks to identify such people.” The MEC said the municipality will soon help 75 beneficiaries through the Emergency Housing Programme. Gogo’s house was one of 37 constructed after Cyclone Eloise damage in Chief Albert Luthuli Municipality.
