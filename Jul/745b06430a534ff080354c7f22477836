CAPE Town City left-back Terrence Mashego is in a race against time to get fit for the kick-off of the new DStv Premiership season. Mashego suffered an injury during a training session with Bafana Bafana last month, and he was withdrawn from the squad. The highly rated defender has been putting in a lot of effort into his recovery journey to make sure he’s ready when City’s Premiership season kicks off against champions Mamelodi Sundowns at home on 5 August. It was heartbreaking to suffer an unexpected injury while he was getting ready to represent Bafana. It’s every player’s dream to play for his country. But the former TS Galaxy captain insisted that he didn’t have time to dwell on the setback. Instead, he’s preparing for his comeback before the new season commences. Mashego, who is ever-present for the Citizens defence, is ready to fight for his place in the starting X1 and make his contribution to the success of the team, and to play for City in the Caf Champions League this season. Since making his debut for the Citizens, the 26-year-old defender quickly cemented his place in the starting line-up, replacing Edmilson Dove at left back. “Some things happen for a reason, and it was probably God’s plan for me to be withdrawn from the national team due to injury,” Mashego told SunSport. “I have been to rehab, trying to make a full return for the Citizens and I have been training with my teammates and I feel much better, a bit stronger and more motivated. “The season starts soon and we’ll play against Sundowns. I hope to make my return in that game. Injuries are not good and they can derail one’s plan but I do pray that I stay injury free this season. “It’s an honour to play for a club like Cape Town City, and I want to make history with this wonderful club and get more starts.”
