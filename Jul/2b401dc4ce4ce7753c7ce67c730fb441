THE defence in the murder case of 23-year-old Thoriso Themane intends to apply for leave to appeal the conviction and sentence of the four convicted teenagers. This after deputy judge president Matsaro Semenya of the Polokwane High Court sentenced Michael Teffo (18), Vincent Mothemela (18), Tshiamo Myeni (19) and Lesetja Ramokgopa (20) to 10 years’ imprisonment each on Wednesday, 29 June. Semenya ordered that they be taken to a juvenile centre until they turn 21, when they would then be taken to prison. Semenya further gave Thabang Mohubedi (20) and Adaho Mudau (20) a fine of R20 000 or five years’ imprisonment for assault, and three years, suspended for five years, to Chuene Maleka and Alfred Mothapo for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi confirmed to Daily Sun that the defence would apply on 14 September. Thoriso’s brother Karabo Themane (34) said they were disappointed. “This just adds salt to the wound because we are still not happy with the sentence.”
