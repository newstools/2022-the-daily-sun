A SUSPECT who allegedly killed a man and stuffed his body in a wheelie bin has been arrested. Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu said the arrest was made on Friday, 1 July after a long search by police in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni. She said the suspect allegedly killed Tebogo Tshwari (26) after assaulting him in his house. After the victim died, the suspect allegedly stuffed his body in a wheelie bin and went to dump him at nearby shops on 16 June. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the dead man was assaulted at an identified house on the very same street where the body was found,” said Mngomezulu. Tebogo’s family said they were happy he’d get justice. His gogo Mapule Mokate (72) said it was not her first grandchild to die violently. “Five years ago, Lucky was killed and he never got justice,” she said. The gogo said her grandson Lucky was kidnapped by taxi drivers and stabbed to death in Soweto, but no one was arrested. Tebogo was allegedly hacked to death with a spade by a neighbour. His body was found by a passerby who contacted the police. Tebogo’s father, Dingane Mokate (55), said he was grateful that his son would get justice. “I’ve been praying that the person who did this would be arrested,” he said. A murder case was opened at the Tsakane Police Station and the suspect was expected to make his first appearance in court soon.
