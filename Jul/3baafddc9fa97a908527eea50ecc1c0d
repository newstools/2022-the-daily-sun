GAUTENG cops cracked down on illicit mining activities and arrested 97 illegal miners and a 62-year-old farm owner in Heidelberg. Following an intelligence driven operation, cops swooped in on a farm where the zama zamas had been operating from. Police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe said upon further interrogation and inspection, the team seized mining equipment and gear, and also discovered that all the suspects, aged between 18 and 35, are Lesotho nationals and the majority were in the country illegally.  “Three unlicensed firearms and 570 rounds of ammunition were also seized. The firearms have been taken in for ballistic testing to determine if they were used in any other crimes. “The farm owner has also been arrested after he was found with illegal ammunition and gold bearing equipment,” said Mathe.  All the suspects will appear in the Heidelberg Magistrates Court on charges of illegal mining, being in the country illegally, human trafficking, possession of explosives and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition.
