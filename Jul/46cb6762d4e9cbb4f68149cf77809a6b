THE thought that Home Affairs has declared mkhulu Johannes Moteane dead is frustrating him. This is because the 87-year-old madala’s pension grant has since been stopped because of the Home Affairs problem. Now he has to depend on neighbours to provide him with food and when they don’t have, he sometimes goes to bed on an empty stomach. Mkhulu Johannes from Daggafontein squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni just wants Home Affairs to know that he’s alive, but hunger will kill him. He said he discovered that he was a walking ghost after he lost his Sassa card in 2019. He told Daily Sun he went to Home Affairs to apply for a new one, but was told he didn’t exist. “I’ve been trying to get my life back for almost three years, but it’s just impossible. “I have this hunger and it’s hard on people to give you food every day,” he told the People’s Paper. His neighbour said that they sometimes try to share the little they have with mkhulu. “Mkhulu is an independent person. But not having an income is taking a toll on his health. You can see he’s not happy,” said the neighbour. “We appeal to Home Affairs to hear him out. “This is an old person and seeing him suffer like this is heartbreaking.” Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane said the matter was receiving attention.
