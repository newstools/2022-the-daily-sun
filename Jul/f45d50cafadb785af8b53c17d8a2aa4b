COPS WERE ready to believe the innocent-looking old lady when she said she had nothing to do with the stolen vehicle. But investigations continued and the gogo is now behind bars, arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle. AND CHARGES OF HIJACKING AND MURDER MAY BE ADDED TO THE CHARGE SHEET! The 74-year-old gogo was nabbed along with her two sons for possession of a suspected stolen car. This was after the hijacking and murder of an off-duty traffic officer, Thabo Mashego (35), in Saselani, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on Friday, 22 July, at around 9pm. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed that on Monday, 25 July, cops in Bushbuckridge received information about a suspicious vehicle parked behind a house. “The information led cops to a house in Agincourt, outside Bushbuckridge. “Upon arrival, cops found an old lady, as well as the vehicle covered with a white cloth,” said Mohlala. “At first, the old woman claimed to have no knowledge of the vehicle. But the cops were not derailed and continued with their investigation.” They then found out that the vehicle was the VW Polo which was reportedly hijacked in an incident that took the life of the traffic officer. “Upon checking the vehicle, the cops discovered that the battery had been removed and hidden in the bedroom of the woman’s son. “The woman and her two sons were arrested for possession of a suspected stolen vehicle,” said Mohlala. He said police can’t rule out the possibility of adding more charges to the suspects’ case and further linking them to a hijacking and murder case. Mohlala said the suspects are expected to appear in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court soon. The Mpumalanga police commissioner, Lieutenant General Semakaleng Manamela, has praised the work done by the police in arresting the three suspects. “We appreciate community members for playing their role and sharing information with the cops, who acted swiftly. “We trust that justice will be served for the victim’s family,” she said.
