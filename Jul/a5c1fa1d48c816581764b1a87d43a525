THINGS got heated at Parliament’s Section 194 Committee hearing on Tuesday, 19 July, when Advocate Dali Mpofu labelled a witness a liar and dishonest. During cross-examination, Mpofu told the committee members not to take anything that came out of the mouth of former senior investigator at the Public Protector’s Office, Tebogo Kekana, as evidence. Kekana testified that he was concerned with the way suspended the public protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, handled the CIEX investigation. He said he raised his discomfort with the attorneys and advocate representing the public protector and he deposed an affidavit under the Protected Disclosures Act in 2019. “Forget about the Protected Disclosures because it was made two years after the event. You are not a whistle-blower. You are the exact opposite of a whistle-blower,” claimed Mpofu. He claimed Kekana was dismissed from his work for dishonesty and should not be taken seriously. “You are going around gossiping and lying about the public protector,” claimed Mpofu.  Chairman of the impeachment committee Qubudile Dyantyi warned Mpofu to mind his language. Kekana is currently challenging his dismissal in the Labour Court. Mpofu said Mkhwebane would tell the committee that the reason she wanted an input from State Security Agency (SSA) about the CIEX report was because it was a signatory to the report. SSA had an intelligence agreement with CIEX to recover a R1,25 billion lifeboat provided to Bankorp (now ABSA) by the Reserve Bank during the apartheid era. Kekana said there was no input from SSA.
