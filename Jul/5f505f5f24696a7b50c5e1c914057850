GAUTENG cops are searching for unknown armed suspects after five people were fatally shot and five others left injured at different places in Alexandra on Thursday, 14 July. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo, it is alleged that four armed suspects went on a robbing and shooting spree in the area. Reports suggested that suspects first met people travelling in a Toyota Etios on Fourth Avenue and Selborne Street, and fired shots at them. They left one person injured. “The second incident occurred at Eleventh Avenue and Boulevard Street, where suspects found two people sitting in a car charging cellphones as there was no electricity due to load shedding. The suspects robbed the victims of their cellphones before shooting them. Both were taken to medical care centres for treatment,” Masondo said in a statement. He added that suspects came across their next victim at Boulevard Street, where he was fatally shot. “The next victim was shot at Seventh Avenue, and died on the scene while two people were robbed of their cellphones and shoes. The suspects met and shot three people at Sixth Avenue. One person was fatally wounded while two others were taken for medical treatment,” Masondo said. Then the last gruesome shooting incident happened at Sixth Avenue and Roosevelt Road, where two people were shot inside an Avanza. Both victims died at the scene. “The police have opened five cases of murder, five of attempted murder and armed robberies,” Masondo said. Meanwhile, one person was arrested after he was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition in Alexandra. He urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or leave a tip-off on the MySAPS App.
