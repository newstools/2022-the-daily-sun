AN Eastern Cape cop has been arrested for his alleged involvement in cases of house robbery, kidnapping and carjacking on 5 July at Ndondo Square, Cala. According to Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana, the 33-year-old victim was allegedly at home with her brothers and children when they heard a hard knock at the door by people who claimed to be police officers. “Allegedly, after banging and forcing the door open, the suspects gained entry to the house carrying firearms. “The four suspects aged 32 to 33, wearing police gear, demanded firearms from the victim while assaulting them,” Kinana said.
