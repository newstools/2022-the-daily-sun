AN ELDERLY couple died in a shack fire in Site B in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on Thursday, 7 July. Nocingephi Kani (65) was sleeping in her shack with her partner, Zolile Stuurman, when fire ate their shack. And residents, together with Nocingephi’s daughter Yolanda Kani (32), blame load shedding as the fire started 30 minutes after the power came back. Yolanda said the two were in the habit of warming their shack with an electric stove, that she suspects they forgot to switch off when they went to sleep. And when electricity came back, the stove switched on while they were asleep, burning the shack. “They would normally switch it on so the coils become red like fire as a way of warming the house. This time around, I think they forgot to switch it off,” she said.

I ran home, but the fire had eaten a huge part of the shack and I knew my mother was sleeping. I’m so saddened,” she said. The city’s fire and rescue service spokesman Jermaine Carelse confirmed that firefighters attended to the scene, but handed over to the SAPS after discovering two bodies. Cops spokeswoman Ndakhe Gwala said: “Harare police responded to a complaint of shacks on fire in SST informal settlement on Thursday. Upon arrival 30 minutes after midnight, they found the bodies of a man and woman, who were declared dead on the scene. The cause of the fire is unknown, and police have registered an inquest for further investigation.”
