THREE thugs were recently caught red-handed while digging up graves in Mabopane, Tshwane. On 15 July, the Tshwane Metropolitan Police Department (TMPD) received a tip-off from security guards who were working night shift at a graveyard about people digging up the graves. Spokesman Isaac Mahamba said officers responded quickly to the graveyard. “Upon arrival, they found three people inside the grave, digging. When they were questioned, they could not account for what they were doing and where they had received permission to dig up the graves,” Mahamba said in a statement. He added that among the three suspects was a sangoma. “They were allegedly looking for dead people’s bones for multi-purposes. They tried to offer a bribe of R1 500,” Mahamba said. Suspects were arrested and charged with violation of graveyard regulations, malicious damage to property and bribery.
