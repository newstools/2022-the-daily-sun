SIX lions that had escaped from the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park in Ulundi, northern KZN, and were troubling villagers, have been put down. This means the misery of villagers from Okukho and Nqulwane, who were fearing for their lives and that of their livestock, is now over. On Saturday, 16 July, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife put down the lions. They then invited two villagers, Lucky Ngqulunga and Similo Khanyile, to show them the six carcasses of the pride. Lucky and Similo were flown in a helicopter over the area where the lions were put down. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesman Musa Mntambo said the lions had killed six cows, and the figure may rise as some villagers still had to taken stock of their cows. He said many villagers had been living in fear. “The villagers’ anger was mounting as it was feared that the lions had lost the fear of humans. Several villagers had alleged they had seen these lions. And instead of the lions running away, they walked straight towards them – forcing them to retreat,” he said. He added that the decision to put down the pride was taken following the villagers’ anger that resulted in a group staging a sit-in. Villager Thulani Dube (59) said he was relieved that the lions were put down. “Now I must visit the department so that I can also claim for my cow that was killed by these lions last week.”
