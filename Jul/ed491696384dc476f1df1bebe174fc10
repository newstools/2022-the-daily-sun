AS ABAFUNDISI, the pastor and his wife were trusted by the community. And they allegedly used their position of trust to convince parents to let their young daughters sleep over. THEN THEY ALLEGEDLY DRUGGED THE CHILDREN AND TOOK PICTURES OF THE NAKED GIRLS! The couple from Worcester, Western Cape, were bust and appeared in court over the allegations. The wife was arrested on Monday, 11 July, and appeared for a bail application on Tuesday, 19 July. The husband was arrested on Monday, 25 July, and appeared in court on Tuesday, 26 July, with their case postponed to Thursday, 4 August. According to cop spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk, the suspects, because they are trusted by parents, would ask parents to have their children sleep over at their house for prayers. Van Wyk said an investigation by the serial and electronic crimes investigation and the Worcester family violence and child protection units led to the arrest of the senior pastor. “Investigations covered incidents between 2016 and 2022 where the suspect deceived the parents of children to allow them to sleep over at their residence. “Children were then drugged, undressed, fondled and pictures were taken. The pastor is charged with five counts of human trafficking, two counts of rape and 100 counts of possession and creation of child pornography. “Investigations are underway as it seems more victims are coming forward,” said Van Wyk. National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said: “The wife of the pastor appeared in the Worcester Magistrates Court court last week after being arrested. “The husband, who cannot be named, joins his wife as her co-accused. The case against both accused has been postponed to 4 August for their formal bail application. The wife’s legal representative withdrew last week but she told the court she will be appointing a new attorney.”
