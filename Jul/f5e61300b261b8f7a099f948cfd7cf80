FORMER Golden Arrows coach Khabo Zondo is back in the PSL top flight after six-years of absence. He has been announced as the Royal AM coach to replace John Maduka, who recently left the club to join Maritzburg United.The 60-year-old Zondo last coached in the PSL top flight in 2009 when he was in charge of Bay United. But his last coaching job in the PSL was that of Royal Eagles, the club previously co-owned by Royal AM boss Shaun Mkhize, who were campaigning in the GladAfrica Championship then. Though Zondo knows MaMkhize well, it is a surprise appointment by the club as they were linked with Owen da Gama, Gavin Hunt and Cavin Johnson. Royal AM, who finished third in the DStv Premiership the last term and will feature in the Caf Confederation Cup, have also signed former Kaizer Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic, former AmaZulu striker Andre de Jong, Swallows duo - Khethokuthula Ndlovu and Ruzaigh Gamiliden.
