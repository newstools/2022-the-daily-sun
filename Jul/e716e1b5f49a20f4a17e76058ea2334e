When they went to the mountain they were boys and now they are back as men. Ndebele initiates are back from the mountain for initiation. They left on the 27 April and came back on Thursday night 30 June. They spent a gruelling two months at the bush to be transformed into men. Covid-19 has delayed the culture as it was supposed to be done last year. In February, Ndebele King Makhosoke II announced that the culture will be performed. Ndebele Chief William Ntobela said he sent (42) boys to the bush for initiation. He said he is happy they all came back. "It was a challenging time for us as we had to perform our culture in the midst of the pandemic. I thank my ancestors for keeping the boys safe. It was not easy and had to deal with a few challenges. I am also happy there were no fatalities. "All I want from the new initiates is to respect elders. They must apply the lessons they have learnt from the bush to lead a good life. Education is very important and they must go back to school. They are men now and they must not be involved in GBV, crime and drugs," he said. Chairman Elias Sikhosana thanked the parents and everyone involved for making sure the boys were safe. "We have produced future men who will take the culture forward. They have learnt valuable lessons and must conduct themselves well," he said. New initiates Matjhila Mtsweni (19) and Madzela Sikhosana (20) said they are happy they are real men now. "It was not easy and what makes man is facing difficult challenges. I am happy to be back as a man," said Matjhila. "I am going to live by all the lessons I have learnt from the bush. I have been taught to be a strong man who respects other people," said Madzela.
