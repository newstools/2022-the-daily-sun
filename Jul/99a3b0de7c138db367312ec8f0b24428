A traffic warden has been killed after she was
knocked down by an alleged drunk. In the early hours of Saturday, 2 July  a driver in a beige Renault
Sandero bumped a female Joburg Metro Police Warden and failed to stop, Public
Safety Ambassador, Wayne Minnaar said in a statement. It is understood the 37-year-old warden was attending to an accident scene
along with her colleagues on the N12 Golden Highway. Minnaar said:  "The driver bumped the warden from the side . Officers
on the scene chased after the driver and apprehended him. READ: Cash van runs over armed tsotsis! "The driver of the Sandero tested 0.69mg on a breatherliser, which is
nearly three times above the legal limit of 0.24mg," said Minnaar. He is facing charges of culpable homicide,  driving under the influence of
alcohol and failing to stop at an accident scene. Public Safety MMC, David Tembe, has strongly condemned the behaviour of the
driver. He said officers or traffic wardens should never be injured or killed when on
and off duty.
