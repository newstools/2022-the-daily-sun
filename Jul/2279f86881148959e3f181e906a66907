IN November, Mzansi was hit with yet another gruesome femicide incident. This time, medical student Tshepang Pitse was killed by her alleged ex-husband Flavio Hlabangwane. Hlabangwane now faces charges of murder. He was arrested after body parts were found in his fridge at his rented room in Soweto. It was later discovered that the body parts were the remains of Tshepang (23). Social activist Thami Madondo has been invested in the case and told Daily Sun they were working on a documentary to help make sense of the murder. Thami, who is co-executive producer of the documentary, said they needed to get involved in the story when they heard about the murder. “After speaking to the family, we saw a need to do a documentary for the public to understand how serious the dynamics and issues of gender-based violence are.” Thami said they also spoke to the investigating officer to get his expertise on the matter.

Tshepang’s uncle Edward Pitse said: “We are aware of the documentary and we are fine with it. We’re also supportive of the documentary.”
