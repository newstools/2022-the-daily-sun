OURlovely Daily Sun is turning 20 years old. This is a milestone achievement for the daily newspaper. The history behind it makes me happy. Daily Sun has made people like me fall in love with the newspaper forever. I buy the Daily Sun every day to get the current news. Even people in my community associate me with the newspaper and always appreciate the letters I write. Happy birthday to our beloved Daily Sun and I wish you many more years. Keep up the good work. Nowadays, people prefer getting their news from the internet, but still, Daily Sun keeps it real with the newspaper. People love the fresh content from this tabloid and I’m happy that I’m one of the regular letter contributors. They say local is lekker and the Daily Sun mostly talks about stuff that affects black people. It talks about black South Africans. It is nice to know how your fellow people are living and what’s happening in your country. Happy 20th birthday to our Daily Sun!
