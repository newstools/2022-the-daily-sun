ANC KZN delegates were united in voicing their unhappiness over the treatment of former president Jacob Zuma through song at the provincial elective conference in Durban on Friday night, 22 July. Despite going into the conference divided on who should lead, the over 1 600-strong delegates all stood and broke into the Wenzeni uZuma song as treasurer-general Paul Mashatile was about to open the conference, that started way behind schedule. It appeared the delegates were sending a message to the top leadership that most Zuma supporters have accused of not supporting him in his legal wrangles. It could also be directed to President Cyril Ramaphosa that he will not be welcomed in the conference as rumours had been circulating that he would be booed if he showed up. Mashatile, talking to journalists on the sidelines, confirmed that Ramaphosa would be closing on Sunday. “The president has already confirmed that he is coming on Sunday. We have not received any reports so far to suggest he is not coming, but we will be in touch with him,” said Mashatile, who added that he had no problem with delegates singing pro-Zuma songs. Premier and outgoing chairman Sihle Zikalala also justified the pro-Zuma song, saying this was the way delegates were showing how pained they were about how he was treated. Zikalala said the song had been sung on a number of occasions, but it was not directed at anyone. “But at the same time, we cannot hide the fact that there is pain in the ANC and general society about how the former president was treated,” he added. Zikalala himself has been accused of betraying Zuma, and got booed at the rallies held outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court to show him support. Zuma commands a huge following in the province, and this has led to candidates seeking election visiting his home for endorsement, including chairmanship contenders Sandile Zungu and Nomusa Dube-Ncube.
