A COMMUNITY is mourning the tragic death of a local traffic cop. Thabo Mashego (35) from Xanthia Village was shot and his VW Polo hijacked on Friday, 22 July at about 9pm. The incident happened in Saselani Village, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. Shocked residents told Daily Sun they heard several gunshots. Later they learnt that Thabo was left lying on the ground bleeding, while a bullet grazed one of the two passengers in his car. Thabo’s devastated father, Vickson (75), said: “When he left home, he said he was going to pick up a stranded friend in Bushbuckridge. “But never returned. “Instead, we received a call that he was no more.” Community safety MEC Vusi Shongwe condemned the murder. He said that police would spare no effort in bringing the culprits to justice. “Our police should not rest until the perpetrators are behind bars. We are also appealing to our communities who may have any information regarding the case to come forward and assist the police,” he said. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela described the incident as barbaric. “The traffic officer was off-duty and driving with his two friends when two armed suspects emerged from the side of the road,” she said. “The suspects then asked him to stop and when he did not, they fired shots at the vehicle. As a result, he stopped his vehicle and the hijackers dragged the injured driver and his two friends out of the car and drove off.” She said the registration number plate of the vehicle was HLL 305 MP. “It is further reported that the victims were assisted by other motorists who took them to Mapulaneng Hospital where the injured traffic officer unfortunately died on arrival,” she said. Manamela said police opened cases of hijacking and murder and were on the hunt for the suspects. Anyone with information should contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or used the MySAPSapp.
