FIVE suspects, alleged to be involved in multiple robberies, were arrested by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) on Wednesday, 27 July. They are facing charges of possession of suspected stolen property and unlawful possession of state property. JMPD spokesman Xolani Fihla said the cops were patrolling around the Wanderers Taxi Rank when they received information of suspects involved in multiple robberies around the CBD. “Upon arrival at the location in Hillbrow, a security guard was found. He led officers to a flat, where they approached the identified room where the suspects reside. Two men were found and the room was searched. Several cellphones, wallets, IDs, military uniforms and new shoes that the suspects could not account for, were recovered,” Fihla said in a statement. He added that the suspects, together with the guard, were arrested as it was found that they all lived together. Cops were then led to the basement of the building, where two other accomplices were found. “Officers found the two men and searched the room. More cellphones, wallets, IDs and registration plates were recovered,” he said. One of the plates was linked to a Renault that had recently been hijacked in Chatsworth. “All suspects were detained at Hillbrow SAPS. It was found that they have previous and pending cases of robbery, murder, hijacking and possession of unlicensed firearms,” Fihla said.
