RAPPER Zingah has finally opened up about what made him retire from music earlier this year. In March, the Dlala rapper announced his retirement from the industry without going into much detail. Now, in an interview on YouTube podcast Everything SA Music, he said Riky Rick’s death was the reason. “What pushed me to announce my retirement was the Riky suicide. That hurt me because I’ve been through a lot in the industry. Having had people do me bad, all the hate and having to make a comeback by myself. So, seeing him take his life when he had put it together like that made feel like f*** this whole thing, now it’s taking my friends,” he said. ALSO READ : PICS: Celebs dazzle at Roast of Khanyi Mbau! Riky died by suicide in February, and his body was found in his studio. Zingah said he also battled depression because of the industry, and seeing Riky taking his life showed him that it wasn’t worth it. “I’ve had to deal with depression, fight my way out and heal myself – just to come and sing for people who don’t even appreciate it. It kills your real life; you lose yourself. And seeing my friend take himself like that just disturbed me,” he said, adding that he was now focusing on himself. However, the former member of hip-hop collective Cashtime Fam said he might still feature on songs. “I’m retired from releasing music. But I’m never going to stop making it. Music chose me. I had been making it, then K.O called me to make it with him and I became a Cashtime guy. And boom, you guys knew me. But I make music because I talk through music,” he said.
