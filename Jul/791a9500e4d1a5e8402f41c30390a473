TELKOM has filed papers to halt an investigation into allegations of corruption, maladministration and improper conduct. The company filed the papers in the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane on Monday, 25 July, on the basis that the investigation was unconstitutional and invalid. President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a proclamation in January authorising the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to investigate Telkom’s affairs. In his affidavit, the company’s acting group executive for legal services Chris Teurlinckx said Ramaphosa acted unlawfully in instructing the SIU to probe allegations dating back as far as 2006. The matter stems from the sale or disposal of Multi-Links Telecommunications, a company acquired in Nigeria in 2006 which later failed, the sale of iWayAfrica and Africa Online Mauritius. The SIU said it would be investigating any losses suffered by Telkom or the state in relation to the sale of businesses acquired by the entity. The SIU is also investigating the procurement of telegraph services and advisory services in relation to broadband and mobile strategy. It’s alleged payments were not made in a fair, transparent or cost effective manner. Telkom’s application is in two parts. Part A seeks to interdict the SIU from continuing with its investigation pending the finalisation of part B of the application. Part B seeks to declare the president’s proclamation unconstitutional and invalid. The SIU’s investigation will cover transactions that took place between 1 June 2006 and 25 January 2022. It will also look at transactions that either took place before June 2006 or after January 2022 but are relevant to matters being investigated.
