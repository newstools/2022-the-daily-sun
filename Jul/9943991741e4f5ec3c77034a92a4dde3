MADALA Moses Mngomezulu claims the worst pain of his life was caused by his sister. According to madala, a fight over his pension money ended with his sister allegedly pouring boiling water over his face, which even changed the colour of his skin! The 60-year-old from extension 7 in Nellmapius, Tshwane, has claimed that the shocking incident happened on the evening of 27 June. He said the trouble started in 2020 when his sister allegedly took his bank card so she could buy bricks to build a backyard room for him to live in. However, she allegedly didn’t use the money for what they agreed upon and in April, he cancelled the card and applied for a new one. “My sister was angry after she tried to withdraw money and the card declined,” he alleged. Moses said he bought a block of bricks on 27 June because it didn’t look like his sister had bought any. “After the bricks arrived, she told me it was not necessary for me to buy them and that was not the agreement,” he claimed. Moses said without saying a word, his sister allegedly poured water on him. He spent the night at Mamelodi Hospital and has not seen her since. Moses said they were both living in a family house, but he now wanted his sister to find her own place. His cousin Themba Nhlapo (59) claimed the sister was a bully. “I want her to be jailed for the evil she does to her own brother,” he said. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said a case of assault was opened and the suspect appeared in court on Friday, 1 July. The suspect will be making her second appearance in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Friday, 8 July.
