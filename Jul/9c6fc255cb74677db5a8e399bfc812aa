GIVEN Nziyane has come out with guns blazing over his suspension as the Independent South African National Civic Organisation (Isanco) councillor in Ward 38. He became a councillor of Athol, Ludlow, Clare and Share in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, last November. But last Wednesday, 13 July, Isanco branch secretary Adam Sibuyi issued a statement recalling Nziyane and suspending him from the position. “Isanco took these decisive steps in the interest of service delivery and its communities as it relates to the projects meant to benefits the people of Ward 38. “Isanco leadership in Ward 38 remains fully committed to completing this process as soon as possible, and to ensure that the projects reach all the deserving people of ward 38 and that they are not hindered in any way,” said Sibuyi. Nziyane said he didn’t agree with his suspension and he wasn’t not going anywhere. “I am still this ward’s councillor and no one else. I am fully aware of Sibuyi’s tactics and his useless statement. “He’s just a cry baby who is trying to drag my name through the mud over nothing. “They accuse me of receiving a bakkie from a contractor in the village, as well as being influential on projects in the community, which is unfounded and baseless,” he said.
