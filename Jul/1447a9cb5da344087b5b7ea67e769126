A COP stationed at Alexandra Police Station in Gauteng is in hot water after he was allegedly found drunk inside a police vehicle in Limpopo on Sunday, 3 July. According to Colonel Dimakatso Sello, preliminary investigations revealed that the cop used the station’s vehicle without authority to travel to another province. “The 36-year-old sergeant was arrested at Ga-Masemola in Limpopo. A case of using a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent, as well as a departmental case, have been opened against the member for further investigations,” Sello said. She said no cop will be allowed to misuse or abuse state resources. “Members of the public are advised to report any misuse of state resources and misconduct of police officers at any police station,” Sello said. She urged the public to contact the Gauteng Complaints Service Centre on 082 442 2000 or the National Service Complaints Call Centre on 0800 333 177.
