MOSES Sibiya, who never misses a funeral in his area, regards himself as a comforter to families in mourning. The 31-year-old, who is affectionately known as Ladymo, has gained himself the title of funeral influencer. Moses from Pienaar, outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, has made a name for himself not only at funerals, but also as a comedian, MC and a musician. He has released singles titled Ama Fall Fall and Dumi Dumi, which he performs at funerals and other gatherings.  This socialite, who styles himself depending on his mood, has tongues wagging with his feminine dress code. Moses, who is a chef by profession, told Daily Sun he decided to remix gospel songs to lighten the mood at funerals. WATCH: Man in mini skirt at a funeral SHOCKS Mzansi! He has gained a huge following on social media since he started with his mission. “I’m always attending funerals because I like singing and to also bring hope to the bereaved families. I don’t like seeing mourners in pain,” he said. “Funerals and death bring sadness and I see myself as a person who brings hope,” he said.  While many find it amusing, others have bashed him for lack of respect for the mourning families. But Sibiya said he is not shaken by what people say. He said some people have accused him of being crazy and depressed.Moses said since he started performing, he has never had problems with any family. “People didn’t understand when I came out of the closet after a long time,” he said. “I have never been depressed or influenced by outside forces. I am fine and healthy.” “The people who are bashing me are jealous and don’t want to see me prosper. When someone comes with a different style, they start to discriminate and drag you down,” he said. “They’re trying to undermine my talent. I don’t care about them. I won’t entertain such people,” he said. Moses said he wanted to take his brand around the world and be famous just like gospel sensation, Rebecca Malope.
