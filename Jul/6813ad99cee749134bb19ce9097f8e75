THE son of Uzalo actor, Cebolenkosi Mthembu, is walking in his father’s shoes. At just six years-old, Cebo Junior is also an actor and also stars on SABC1’s Uzalo. Cebo Junior, who is a grade 1 pupil at Ashely Primary School pupil in Pinetown outside Durban, plays the role of one of three kids who witnessed a domestic violence incident among their parents, which was caused by the mother’s drug addiction. The three kids stoped witnessing the violence when the radio show, hosted by Gabisile (Baby Cele), took the initiative to help their mother go to rehab. Cebolenkosi, who plays Detective Nyawo on the show, said his son went to auditions just like other kids.

He got the role, not because he’s my son, but because he impressed the producers,” said Cebolenkosi. The actor said he could see that his son’s future was bright. “He is too smart. What I like about him is that he isn’t afraid of challenges. As young as he is, Cebo Junior is very brave. “But I wish he focuses on school and treat acting as one of his hobbies. I say this because the acting industry is not easy. I will encourage him to focus on his education to make life better for him,” said Cebolenkosi.
