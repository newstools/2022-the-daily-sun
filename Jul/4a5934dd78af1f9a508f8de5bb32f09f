FORMER Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli has been granted parole. The Department of Correctional Services confirmed his release on Tuesday, 5 July. The department’s spokesman, Singabakho Nxumalo, said Mdluli qualified to be considered for parole placement after serving one third of his sentence as his sentence falls under the Phaahla Judgment. He said minimum detention period was on 28 May. “But he could not be considered for parole placement at the time due to a pending court case. Subsequently, he was given a bail of R10 000 (paid in full on 28 June) thus paving the way for his parole consideration process to proceed,” said Nxumalo. The former Vosloorus Police Station commander and close ally of ex-president Jacob Zuma was sentenced to five years in prison for kidnapping, assault and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The case related to the murder of Oupa Ramogibe in 1998. Ramogibe was dating Tshidi Buthelezi, who was Mdluli’s common-law wife. The state failed to prove murder and Mdluli was convicted for assaulting Ramogibe, Buthelezi and a friend, Alice Manana. Mdluli is currently facing corruption, fraud and theft charges relating to the alleged looting of a police slush fund between 2008 and 2012 when he was at the helm of Crime Intelligence. He’s accused along with former supply chain manager Heine Barnard and former chief financial officer, Solomon Lazarus. They are out on R10 000 bail each.
