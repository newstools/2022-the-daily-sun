THE murder case against Thabang Moswane was postponed by the Koster Magistrates Court on Thursday, 7 July. The 24-year-old from Mathopestad near Koster, North West, was arrested in May for allegedly stabbing his mother, Kedisaletse Moswane (53), to death. His twin brother allegedly saw him drinking the blood from her stab wound. The case was postponed to 1 August for further investigation while the accused remained in custody. Community member Oupa Tshoagong (29) said they were interested in the outcome of the case. “We want to see justice being done in the end,” said Oupa. ALSO READ |
