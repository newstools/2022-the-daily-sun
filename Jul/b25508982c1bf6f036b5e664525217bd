RESIDENTS have grown gatvol of power outages. So to stop izinyoka, some residents of Diepkloof zone 4, Soweto, have hired a welder to make a lock to stop izinyoka from accessing the transformer box in their area. But the move has angered some residents, who say it’s illegal. The residents who hired the welder said they were tired of power thieves. “We can’t suffer because of some individuals who have a sense of entitlement and want everything for free,” said a resident. “We apologise to Eskom for doing this, but we do this as a last resort.” Eskom spokesman Sikonathi Mantshantsha said it was illegal to tamper with a transformer. He said only technicians could open the boxes.
