KUTAZWA “Rooksy” Gqirana has been accused of cheating her former landlord out of rent. The Real Housewives of Cape Town personality is accused of owing Dr Rethabile Possa-Mogoera over R150 000 after allegedly failing to pay her rent for eight months. Rethabile said Rooksy rented her home in February 2020. She was supposed to pay a deposit but she said she was waiting for money so they allowed her to stay. Rethabile said after a month, the money didn’t come through. She and her husband spoke to Rooksy but she allegedly kept telling them stories and bribing them with clothes from her online boutique. “By the time we decided to evict her, we were in lockdown and the law didn’t allow us to do so,” said Rethabile. “We begged her to pay the rent but she wouldn’t. She said the lockdown hurt her business.” ALSO READ: Former Imbewu actress gets married! Rethabile said Rooksy wasn’t paying for water and the municipality wanted to disconnect the services. She said she told Rooksy she was selling the house, hoping it would make her want to leave but that also didn’t work. “She ended up moving after the water was disconnected. It was as if she was trying to sabotage me.” She said they couldn’t find her until they saw her on TV, claiming to have millions. “She owes us R158 000. She only paid rent for the first two months. I now have to pay R2 500 of the water bill every month that she never paid,” she said. “All we got from her were lies after lies,” she said. Speaking to Daily Sun, Rooksy said just because God had elevated her, Rethabile thought she could ruin her name. “I have nothing to say. I won’t even involve lawyers,” she said. She said Rethabile had her number and she should have called her or her sister if she had a problem.
