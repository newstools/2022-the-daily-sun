IF YOU thought gated neighbourhoods are for suburbs only, think again. Kasi residents say they are tired of crime and the only way is to control who gets in and out of their kasis. In Ivory Park 2, near Tembisa, residents have joined the trend. Ebony Park is another kasi that has gates in its neighbourhood. “We had to follow the likes of Sandton with gated communities as we lose clothes from washing lines,” said resident Bonolo Choene. Resident Solly Moutle said they saw the need to have their area fenced.
