THEY are saying, “no to alcohol at our school!” These are the words of pupils, residents, concerned parents and the World Changers Candidates organisation. Leondale High School pupils in Germiston, Ekurhuleni are opposing the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill, which will see alcohol being sold at schools during school functions, if approved. World Changers Candidates’ Lucas Mahlakgane said this was the message in their petition, which will be launched by pupils as part of their school readiness campaign on Tuesday, 19 July. Pupils said government’s pronouncement on dagga being legalised has largely contributed to the infamous dagga party on 20 April, and they were worried the bill would lead to substance abuse at schools. He said the campaign and petition, supported by the SGB, parents and pupils, will be launched on 19 July as part of the school’s special assembly. They’re hoping to collect about 2 000 signatures, 1 700 of which are of registered pupils at the school. Pupils Katlego Mabena and Nceba Ngwenya, who have become drug activists since the controversial dagga party video went viral, will lead the campaign. They’ll share evidence-based drug abuse prevention programmes, which the school adopted following the incident. Daily Sun tried but couldn’t get Education Department comment at time of going to print.
