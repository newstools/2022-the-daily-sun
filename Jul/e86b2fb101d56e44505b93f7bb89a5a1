Duarte died at the age of 68 on Sunday, 17 July morning after a long illness. She will be buried on Sunday afternoon according to Muslim rites at Westpark Cemetery in Joburg. The Presidency said Ramaphosa will deliver the eulogy at the funeral proceedings. “President Ramaphosa wishes to pass his condolences to the family, friends and comrades of ambassador Duarte, who dedicated her life to the liberation of South Africa and particularly the emancipation of women,” said the Presidency.
