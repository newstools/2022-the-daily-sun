TWO sets of twins tragically burnt to death in a shack fire on Monday, 4 July. The two sets of twins, aged eight and 13, were with their 17-year-old brother when the incident happened. Mpumalanga police spokesman, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, said the police were called to the scene in Marikana squatter camp in Hendrina. He said when cops arrived, they found firefighters battling to put out the blaze. “Unfortunately, two sets of twins, two boys and two girls, were certified dead,” he said. The cause of the fire had not been identified yet, but there were loose cables on the ground. It’s suspected the fire might have been started by an illegal electricity connection. Mohlala said it was alleged that the 33-year-old mum of the kids left them in the care of their brother three days before the fire broke out. “When the fire broke out, the brother tried to save his siblings, but he couldn’t as it was already at an advanced stage,” he said. “The mother and the boy were taken to hospital as they were in a state of shock.”
