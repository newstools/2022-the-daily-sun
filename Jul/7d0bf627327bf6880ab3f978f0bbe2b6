THE Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 27 July, granted R500 bail to a 74-year-old gogo. The gogo, together with her three sons, aged 33, 35 and 46, appeared in connection with possession of a suspected stolen VW Polo belonging to slain traffic cop Thabo Mashego (35). But her sons were remanded in custody for being in the country illegally. They were appearing before Magistrate Ayesha Kikia and were not yet asked to plead. Police pounced on the suspects in Agincourt on Monday, 25 July, and the last one on Wednesday. Mashego was hijacked and shot in Saselani near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Friday, 22 July. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said on Monday, visible policing members received information regarding a suspicious car parked behind a house, covered with a white cloth. “The information led them to the house, where they found an old woman and the car, of which at first she refused knowledge of. But members discovered that it was the VW Polo reportedly hijacked during the incident that claimed the life of the officer.” He said they also discovered the car battery was removed and hidden inside the bedroom of the woman’s son (46). “The woman and two of her sons were arrested for possession of a suspected stolen car.” The matter was postponed to 3 August for bail application.
