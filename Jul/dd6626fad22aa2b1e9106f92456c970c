VILLAGERS from Okukho in Ulundi, northern of KZN, are fuming. This after losing their livestock, which is now becoming a norm. They said since the fence at Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park was cut, the lions easily escaped, went to the village and killed their livestock. A resident told Daily Sun that the only thing that needed to be done was to repair the fence. “But the park is ignorant. Now we suffer because every time these lions escape, they come to our homes and kill our livestock,” said the resident. Another resident said they were also not safe as one day, lions would kill people, too. “All we are asking for is that they fix the broken fence so the lions don’t leave the park and we are also safe,” said the resident. Villagers said they had complained about this issue but nothing was being done. “As the lions have eaten these goats and cows, chances are that owners will not be paid,” said one resident. KZN Ezemvelo Wildlife spokesman Musa Mntambo said: “Last Tuesday, a pride of lions escaped from the park and later went back after having killed a cow. On Thursday morning, they escaped again. We had to use a chopper to push them back and repaired the fence where it had been cut by people who wanted to illegally access the park. “Five cows were reported to have been killed on Monday. I’m not aware of any lion that was caught. The said pride is collared and easy for us to monitor. We have engaged with residents who have had their cows killed by the lions to discuss compensation.”
