The mother who reported her newborn baby missing has been
bust for lying to the police. The Gauteng police spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Mavela
Masondo said the 36-year-old Soweto woman has been charged with perjury. She was arrested on Monday, 4 July. This comes after the woman claimed that her 8-day-old baby Hlelokuhle Khumalo was snatched from her hands-on Friday, 1 July, at Zola in Soweto. She said she was walking from a grocery store, just before 5
pm, when she saw a couple approaching in her direction. When they got closer,
she said, the man pointed a gun at her and the woman snatched her baby before
speeding off in a white car. She told Daily Sun that the woman appeared to be in her 40s. She pleaded with the alleged kidnapped not to harm her baby
and bring her home alive. She said she had no idea who could take her baby and willing
to pay a ransom for her safe return Mzansi was touched and prayed for the baby to be found. However, all these claims are said to be a lie. Unconfirmed claims suggest that the baby didn't belong to
the woman. The biological mother took the baby back.
