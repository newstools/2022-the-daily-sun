THE murder trial of former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa continues in the North Gauteng High Court on Tuesday, 12 July. And though it started almost four months ago, only one state witness has taken the stand, Sergeant Thabo Mosia. When trial was adjourned last month, the court agreed to give Advocate Malesela Teffo time to prepare argument on his jurisdiction and relating to a second docket, expected to be heard. When the court started, State prosecutor Advocate George Baloyi said Teffo did not file heads on his jurisdiction argument, and so he and Advocate Zandile Mshololo, of accused number five, could not file answering affidavits. Baloyi said correspondence from Teffo indicated that he had abandoned his application.  He also confirmed that Teffo’s application for charges to be dropped was before the National Director of Public Prosecutions. He mentioned that it would have been proper for Teffo to make the application in Tshwane as he made the decision to prosecute. Teffo abandoned the argument over the court’s jurisdiction, but insisted that his clients were not the right people to be charged and prosecuted for the murder. After a short adjournment, he presented a letter to the court from accused three, in relation to the conditions he was being subjected to. Teffo said he had learnt that there were no permanent heads at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Facility, where the accused was kept. He described it as Hollywood, saying everyone was acting. Baloyi and Mshololo objected to the reading, stating that they wanted the prison head to see it first.
