THE corruption case against former Bosasa chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi has been postponed to October for a high court date. Agrizzi stands accused of offering gratification on behalf of Bosasa to former parliamentarian, Vincent Smith, in exchange for his influence as then chairman of Parliament’s oversight committee on Correctional Services. Bosasa scored contracts totalling just over R1 billion from the Department of Correctional Services between 2004 and 2007. Agrizzi did not appear in person in the Palm Ridge Specialised Crimes Court on Tuesday, 12 July, because of ill-health. The state brought an application last year to have him assessed by its independent pulmonologist – a doctor who diagnoses and treats diseases of the respiratory system – after his numerous failures to appear citing ill-health. The two were arrested in 2020 on a series of fraud and corruption charges. Their arrests came after Agrizzi spilled the beans at the Zondo Commission that Smith and other ANC bigwigs, including former ANC president Jacob Zuma and Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, received gifts from Bosasa. Their cases have since been separated because of Agrizzi’s no-show in court. The matter will be back in court on 18 October.
