NYAOPE addicts were seen collecting scrap metals in the area. Residents who saw them claim they ignited the fire that spiralled out of control and spread to the nearby shacks. Judas Mbatha from Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni, whose shack is close to the bush where the fire started, was not home when the incident happened on Friday, 1 July. When he came back, he found his shack engulfed by flames and there was nothing he could do. The fire ate all his possessions and what worries him is that his children’s uniform has also been burned. As schools will be opening in the coming weeks, he’s worried his children will have nothing to wear. “We lost everything. My furniture, clothes and my kids’ books and uniform are gone. I’m appealing to the public to donate some uniform,” he said. Resident Amos Ngwenya said they tried to extinguish the fire but it was too strong. “It’s sad what happened to our neighbour,” he said. Residents said they were concerned about long grass next to their shacks because thugs hide there and even start fires. “We won’t always be able to see them as they start the fire,” he said. Another resident Pheello Ndamase said they tried locating the nyaope addicts but couldn’t find them. An inquest docket was opened at Etwatwa Police Station.
