FOLLOWING the death of 21 young people at a tavern, officials have raided establishments to check if they are complying with regulations. Buffalo City Metro officials visited taverns in Scenary Park on Monday, 4 July, ahead of the mass funeral service planned for the victims. The 21 young people died at Enyobeni Tavern in Scenary Park, East London, on Sunday, 26 June. Their mass funeral, which will be held at the Scenery Park Sports Field on Wednesday 6 July, will be attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa and Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane. Police spokesman Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana said: “Forensic investigation results on the cause of the deaths are still pending, with police reassuring the families that when the results are available, they will be informed.” Deputy mayor Princess Faku said officials checked that taverns were following the Eastern Cape Liquor Board’s rules and municipal safety standards.  “There will be more awareness campaigns and joint operations to regularly check on all 19 taverns in that kasi,” she said. “The fire, disaster management, law enforcement, building, planning and environmental departments visited eight taverns and various compliance issues were picked up. “The visits were conducted in conjunction with the Liquor Board and the Department of Social Development with the aim of raising awareness, inspecting, and monitoring compliance.” Faku said one tavern was closed down and a suspect was arrested for selling liquor without a licence. “Alcohol that was sold illegally was confiscated. Another tavern owner was issued with a compliance notice after failing to display a valid registration certificate. “There was an alarming number of patrons in most of the establishments. As a way forward, the metro and the Liquor Board will be conducting a workshop with all 100 councillors to ensure they are aware of the by-laws,” she said. Faku also urged parents not to send their kids to buy alcohol as that will encourage them to drink.
