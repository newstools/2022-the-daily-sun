FAMILY, friends and social activists gathered at the Moruleng sportsground, North West on Saturday to finally lay Tshepang Pitse to rest. The 23-year-old Wits University medicine student was allegedly killed by her husband, who was later found to be her cousin, Flavio Hlabangwane, in November last year. Some of her remains were found inside Flavio’s fridge by his girlfriend at the place he was renting in Soweto. Her family had to wait for almost eight months to get some of her remains while others are still not found. Her sister, Gloria Pitse, said she wishes she could have protected her, had she known what was happening. “I’m not sure how we will get over her death. We were looking forward to her graduation next year,” she said. Thami Madondo from Khulumandoda Foundation said he prayed the justice system made an example of the culprit. “He may have pleaded guilty, but we are dealing with a smart man. “We hope he doesn’t cheat his way out of prison. Men need to stop lying to each other when we meet. If we open up and begin conversations with our sisters, we will know boys are beating our women.” The late Patrick Shai’s son, Kopano Shai, said though some of the family knew about the abuse without doing anything, they should not be blamed. “The only thing we can do now is to stand together.” He called for women to stop dropping charges against perpetrators. “Help us to help you. It’s easy to come to the foundation and say he is beating you but after that you go back to him.” About Tshepang, Kopano said: “It’s sad I have to speak about you at your funeral. I wish I could be speaking at your wedding or graduation.” Local councillor Obakeng Pilane asked: “When will we as the community say no more to such evil acts?” Pilane said the violence that continues to be perpetrated against women and children couldn’t continue. Tshepang was laid to rest at the Moruleng cemetery. She’s survived by her father and sisters, Gloria and Tshenolo Pitse.
