POLYGAMIST and reality star Musa Mseleku is on the receiving end of backlash once again. This follows his comments on the second episode of Mnakwethu season 3, which aired on Tuesday evening, 12 July. On this episode, Siphiwe Masuku said that he wants to take a second wife because his fiancee, Sibongile Nxumalo, has an ancestral calling. As a result she sometimes cannot be intimate with him. But Sibongile was having none of it. Eventually she demanded two goats for damages and a car before she could consider Siphiwe’s request. She further revealed that Siphiwe would never afford a car and he would have to choose between her and the girlfriend. At this point Mseleku made comments and said Sibongile was being selfish and abusive towards her husband. Mseleku’s comments were wildly criticised by the viewers, who felt he was not considerate towards women. ALSO READ: SABC presenter needs your help! Liyanda commented: “I expected Mseleku to be playing more of an advisory role than just accompanying these boys. He’s starting to look like that friend who’s just a partner in crime – makes him look stupid.” Senior Kage commented: “Wait... so Museleku is saying that the first wife is selfish because she doesn’t want a sister wife yet she is depriving her husband sex because of her calling. Is this extended to women? Can a woman also get her husband a helper when he has a calling?” Siphesihle said: “One thing about Mseleku, he’ll portray the husband as the victim every time without fail.” No wrote: “Bab’Mseleku, respect the fact that some women don’t want isithembu! Why is so hard.”
