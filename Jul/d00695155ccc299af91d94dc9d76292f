THE family of Sindiso Magaqa is disappointed after the case against his alleged killers was postponed again on Tuesday, 19 July. Friends and family of the former ANC Youth League secretary packed the Pietermaritzburg High Court in KZN, hoping to see the trial started. The matter was postponed to 27 July to allow the state to give feedback on the ballistic report. Trial had to be adjourned to allow accused Mlungisi Ncalane to be examined by a psychiatrist after his lawyer, Shane Matthews, said he was not mentally fit to stand trial. Ncalane was taken to Fort Napier Hospital but yesterday, trial resumed after the court heard he was mentally fit but had a problem with alcohol and dagga. Magaqa, a councillor at the time, was gunned down while in his car in Ibisi in Umzimkhulu in 2017. He was rushed to hospital, where he died three months later. Councillor Jabu Mzizi and Nontsikelelo Mafu, who were with him, were wounded. In 2019, former cop Sibonelo Myeza and businessman Mbulelo Mpofana were arrested. They were later joined by former mayor Mluleki Ndobe and municipal manager Zweliphansi Sikhosana, who were later released. Ncalane and Sibusiso Ncengwa were later also arrested and charged.
