THE murder case against a cop accused of killing his wife has been postponed. Mthokozisi Nene (44) appeared in the Camperdown Magistrates Court on Monday, 4 July as residents protested outside. He is accused of shooting his wife, Thobeka Msomi-Nene (40), at their home in Ntshanga, outside Pietermaritzburg, last month. Neighbours heard a heated argument before gunshots rang out. Thobeka’s sister, Nontuthuko Msomi, said: “We pray that he stays behind bars because we don’t know who he will hurt next.” She said Thobeka was his third victim that the family knew of. “We won’t feel safe if he is set free. That man is very dangerous. “We warned my sister that one day he’d kill her and eventually he did,” she said. “It’s so painful because we tried to open her eyes to the kind of treatment he was giving her.” The Msomi family was joined outside court by Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, and a group of social workers. They protested, pleading with the court to deny the suspect bail. Khoza said people who continued to murder women and children had no place in society. She said men should lead from the front in campaigns against GBV. “We were pleased that they considered a lot of aspects in this case. “It is clear that the murder was premeditated,” she said. The case was postponed to 13 July for a formal bail application.
