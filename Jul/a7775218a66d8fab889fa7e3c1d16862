THE cause of the death of five-year-old Mzwandile Zitho has been revealed. Mzwandile, one of the three kids allegedly killed by Pontsho Mohlanka, was not poisoned but was suffocated. On Wednesday 27 July, Forensic medical officer Doctor Monyakane Sekobolo of Sebokeng Forensic Pathology Services told the high court sitting in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni, how he arrived at the conclusion that Mzwandile was suffocated. Sekobolo performed the postmortem on Mzwandile on 16 April 2020, a day after his body was found at the tavern run by Mohlanka and her boyfriend. “The toxicology report came back negative for any poisoning,” he said. “There were abrasions on the face. Epicedial haemorrhage and sub pleural haemorrhage are highly suggestive of suffocation.” He explained suffocation as a blockage of the airways. “A lack of oxygen to the body and the brain if continued leads to a person becoming unconscious and subsequently, they die,” he said. “Epicedial haemorrhage is caused by pressure, with the heart not being able to pump the blood to the blood vessels.” Sekobolo said there were abrasions on the left side of the mouth, white foam coming from the nose and more abrasions on the right ankle. These gruesome details brought tears to the face of Mzwandile’s grandmother Nompumelelo Zitho, who fled the courtroom weeping. Due to the defence lawyer having to attend to other matters, the case was postponed to Friday 29 July.
