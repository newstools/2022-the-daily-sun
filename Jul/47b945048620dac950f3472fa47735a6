WHEN the fuel prices increased on Wednesday, 6 July, the Ga-Rankuwa taxis also increased fares for commuters. From Friday, 8 July, a taxi ride from Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane, to the Pretoria CBD went up from R30 a trip to R35. Local trips now cost R17, and prices for other destinations would be increased as well. A concerned taxi commuter, Thabo Nkomo (35), told Daily Sun that the petrol price hike had affected them as businesspeople too. He said taxis owners should engage with the community before increasing fares because it is affecting their daily lives. “The fuel price hike has affected our businesses. We are struggling to get more goods for our customers,” he said. Betty Ngobeni (26), who’s one of the people affected, said: “We are struggling to get our stock because of these difficult times. I have even reduced how often I go to stock my goods to sell.” Betty said the little money they made was spent on transport as it had become very expensive. Mothusi Matsweketsane (43) said that the country was in big trouble. “The fuel price hikes, expensive food and load shedding are affecting us a lot,” he said. He said nothing was cheap and basic commodities had become costly. “We are also struggling to pay for our children’s transport,” he said. The South African National Taxi Council spokesman in Tshwane, McDonald Makata, said: “The taxi fares have increased because the fuel prices have gone up. The maintenance of the vehicles is also expensive because of the price hikes.” He said all the taxis from Ga-Rankuwa, including local taxis, had as of 8 July 2022 increased fares.
