TWO people were taken to hospital after an accident involving 13 vehicles on Saturday, 2 July. One person was seriously injured and had to be airlifted to a medical facility and the other was transported to a hospital with minor injuries. This after the crash on the N1, near the Garsfontein off-ramp in Tshwane. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman deputy chief Charles Mabaso said when the accident was initially reported, there were claims that at least 20 vehicles were involved, including a bus, truck and taxi. “After struggling to reach the centre of the accident scene, emergency services were able to make further assessments with law enforcement officers and Bakwena Road Patrollers, only to find out that 13 vehicles were involved in the accident, which included a truck, bus, taxi and two trailers,” said Mabaso “Fortunately, there were no fatalities recorded on the scene. Only two patients were transported to medical facilities,” he added. Mabaso said the road where the horrific accident happened was closed for most of the night and was only completely cleared at around 4am on Sunday morning, 3 July. “The cause of the accident is not known at the moment. “Law enforcement officers are working on the matter to determine the cause,” said Mabaso. According to a statement by Emer-G-Med, they also responded to the accident. The statement read: “At approximately 7pm on Saturday night, Emer-G-Med paramedics, together with multiple emergency service agencies, responded to the scene of a multi-vehicle collision on the N1. “Reports from the scene are that twelve light motor vehicles, a truck and a bus collided, leaving as many as 70 people injured. Incident command officers established an on-scene triage area and further investigation revealed one patient to be in a critical condition.”
