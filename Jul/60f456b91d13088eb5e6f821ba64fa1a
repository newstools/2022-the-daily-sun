THE taxi industry is not happy about laws being tightened to target drivers who break the rules of the road. City of Cape Town safety and security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith said the provincial government had approved the municipality’s request to amend traffic enforcement by-laws. Smith said the amendments would give Metro police, law enforcement officers and traffic cops the power to immediately impound vehicles when laws were broken. “The legislation will allow us to take drastic action against those who continue to disregard our road rules and endanger other users, including those operating in the taxi industry, partaking in illegal street racing activities and fail to correctly display number plates,” he said.

tears! The Cape Organisation for the Democratic Taxi Association (Codeta) said it was not happy with the news.  Spokesman Andile Khanyi said the association approached the government about laws that were unfriendly to the industry but instead of dealing with the matter, it was making it worse. “The government is pouring paraffin on fire and their actions is unjustified. The industry is being targeted. All these laws don’t apply to Golden Arrow or MyCiti buses.” Amaphela driver Ntuthuzeli Siziba (40) said they were already suffering at the hands of traffic cops. “If they are going to change the laws to allow cops to impound our cars more easily, it means we are in serious trouble. How are we even going to work?” he said. But Motorist Nandipha Swartbooi (34) said the changes were long overdue. “Taxi drivers disregard rules and cause congestion. In many cases, accidents are caused by people who don’t follow rules.”
