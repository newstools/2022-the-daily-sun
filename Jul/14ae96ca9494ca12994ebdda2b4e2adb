SEVEN accused were sentenced for public violence by the Alexandra Magistrates Court on Friday, 1 July. According to Colonel Dimakatso Sello, the accused were arrested on 29 May, following protest actions that were led by a movement called Dudula in Alexandra. “One of the accused, Simon Motaung, was identified as the leader of the movement. All suspects were found guilty and sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment, wholly suspended for five years, on condition that they must not be convicted of public violence during the period of suspension,” Sello said in a statement. Reacting to the sentence, police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela urged people to refrain from being part of public violence and destroying infrastructure as this amounted to a criminal offence that was punishable by law. “May this sentence be a deterrence to those who think of being involved in public violence,” Mawela added.
