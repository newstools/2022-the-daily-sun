FAMILY members need help in finding their child. They’re afraid that she will end up being involved in wrong activities because she doesn’t want to be told what to do or not to do. Ayanda Sosibo (13) went missing on 27 June, and her family fears that the worst might happen. Her sister, Noluthando Sosibo (27), told Daily Sun that Ayanda was troublesome and had been a problem since last December. She said she started acting out when she started dating, and had been uncontrollable ever since. “Mum would reprimand her now and she would turn around and do the same thing again,” said Noluthando, adding that her sister was always hanging out in places she had told her not to. “These are places where you’d find kids who smoke and do all the wrong things. Next to it is a place where bodies are always found, and it’s scary,” she said. She added that it wasn’t the first time that Ayanda had disappeared – she first did in March, and then came back home with a social worker. “We threatened to take her to a ‘stout school’, and that might have driven her away.” Noluthando said all the leads they had were unsuccessful. They were told Ayanda was seen at Daveyton Mall and in a certain park. “We went there several times but we didn’t find her or anyone who might know her. If she sees this article, we want her to know that we love her and want the best for her. She’s way too young and we want her to have a bright future. If we did anything to hurt her, she really needs to come back home so we can fix it,” she added. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo confirmed that an inquiry of a missing person was opened, and urged residents with any information to contact the police.
