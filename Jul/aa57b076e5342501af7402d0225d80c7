MAPOPI RADEBE has been to countless Home Affairs offices, hoping to get the lives of her family on track. According to her Identity Document (ID), she is a man and she can’t get her children registered. HOME AFFAIRS INSISTS THAT A MAN CAN’T HAVE BABIES! Mapopi Radebe (49) from Braamfischerville in Soweto told Daily Sun that she got the ID in 2006 and was told her ID number belongs to a man. She said because of this issue, her children cannot get IDs. “I have been going to Home Affairs offices in Roodepoort since 2008 trying to get help,” she said. “I have applied for nine IDs after this one but not even one has come back,” she said. She said the last one she did was in 2021. When she went to check a few of weeks ago, she was told the ID is still in Pretoria. “I always have to go to doctors to verify that I’m a female,” she said. Mapopi said her biggest worry is that her children can’t get IDs. “I have cancer and can die at any time. What will happen to my children? “If they can’t sort out my papers, can they at least sort out my children’s papers? “I’m no longer worried about myself. I am tired. “I can’t even work. In order for my kids to learn, I had to take them to private schools because they were not able to go to public schools,” said Mapopi. One of her children, Ketshepileone, wrote his matric exams four years ago with an affidavit. Ketshepileone said his father tried to get an ID for him the following year. “It is frustrating because I can’t get work or go to university. My life is stuck because I don’t have an ID. It is depressing,” he said. Home Affairs media liaison officer, Siya Qoza, said any person who realises that their identity document reflects a wrong gender should visit a Home Affairs office and apply for a rectification. “We apologise that it has taken so long to resolve Ms Radebe’s application. Her ID number has been rectified. She is being assisted to apply for a new ID.”
