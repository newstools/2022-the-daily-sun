FOUR suspects believed to be responsible for bank robberies were arrested in the Joburg CBD on Wednesday, 13 July. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said cops received information about suspects who were going to rob one of the victims in Joburg. “Members from the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department were activated to back up the team that kept close observation. The team spotted and followed the car that matched the description given, from Turffontein to Joburg CBD, where they stopped it,” Masondo said in a statement. He added that the suspects, aged between 33 and 37, were found with police uniforms, a replica of a firearm as well as a Toyota Corolla fitted with blue lights and false registration plates. Masondo said one of the four suspects was found wearing an incomplete police uniform. “All suspects were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, impersonating police officers and possession of suspected stolen property,” he said, adding that more charges may be added.
