TRAFFIC officer Thapelo Mokgwabona has dedicated his spare time to fixing potholes! So far, with the help of his neighbours, he has closed eight potholes. Thapelo from Leondale, in Ekurhuleni, who is a JMPD member in the public order division, has been a cop for almost 20 years. He told Daily Sun he decided to fix the potholes when he realised the local municipality wasn’t attending to them. “Motorists are forced to swerve while others use opposite lanes to avoid potholes,” her said. “This could result in major accidents. Those who are not aware of the potholes drive into them and damage their wheels.” ALSO READ |
IZINKABI: R20K to kill cheating hubby Thapelo said earlier this year he approached his neighbours, who had been doing house renovations, and asked them to donate cement leftovers. On his first day fixing potholes, Thapelo was joined by his 10-year-old daughter and her friend. It didn’t take long before he was joined by his friends and neighbours. “This has become a community initiative and a hobby.” Most of the concrete and cement used to close potholes are donated by community members. Community leader, Bheki Masondo, said: “This is a great initiative. We applaud Tapelo and the community who stepped in.”
