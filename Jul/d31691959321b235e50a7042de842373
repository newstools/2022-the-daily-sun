The woman told court that her then 45-year-old boyfriend regularly chocked her with his hands and belt. According to Daily Mail, the horrific incident took place last May in Yeovil, England.

Bristol Crown Court heard that she reportedly threw the knife at the man, and it lodged four inches into his chest. The woman told court that sometimes, the victim would choke her out, causing her to pass out. “Sometimes he would do it with his hands. Sometimes he would do it with a belt, quickly around my head in a loop. I didn’t really say anything. I just told him to be careful. I was okay with it; he liked it; he liked doing it,” the woman told the court. She claimed that she once told her partner that after regaining consciousness, she felt like it was rape. The publication reported that a post-mortem examination concluded the preliminary cause of death as a single stab wound. Prosecutor Jo Martin told court that the woman had killed her lover with a knife she had taken from the kitchen drawer. “There was a single wound to his chest. The large knife that she used went into his chest to a depth of 10cm,” Martin said. The trial continues.
