THE bail verdict of the three suspects accused of killing Kutlwano Kasibe was postponed on Monday, 11 July. The suspects were told by the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto that they’d have to wait until Tuesday, 12 July to hear their fate. The matter was postponed to allow the investigating officer to submit more evidence. The court cheered when Magistrate David Mhango told the accused they were facing very serious charges. “I’m really worried about the community and if the accused killed the deceased, why they did that,” he said. This came after the defence team stated it was unfortunate the three were charged when it could have been anyone in the community. But the state insisted it had a strong case. The state told the court residents could take the law into their own hands if the accused were released on bail. Kutlwano (16) from Molapo, Soweto, who was mentally challenged, was tied to a tree and doused with ice water and sanitiser before being sjambokked and shocked with a car battery. This happened after residents accused him of stealing a tap. But the tap was not found in his possession. He was later dumped at the side of the road, where his mum found him. Four suspects were bust for his murder, but one of them was released due to a lack of evidence. Meanwhile, members of Kutlwano’s family gathered outside court with residents to demand that bail be denied. They said they missed Kutlwano’s dance moves and laughter.
