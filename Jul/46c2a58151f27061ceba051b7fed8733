COMMUNITY members gathered outside court on Wednesday, 27 July, as three men accused of killing two SA Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) members appeared. Speaking outside Thohoyandou Magistrates Court, Limpopo secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), Gerald Twala, said the victims had been vocal about the Vhembe District’s unlawful R300 million investment in VBS. Timpson Musetsho (50) and Ronald Mani (50) were gunned down in separate incidents in 2019. “We want those who hired the hitmen to also be arrested and face the might of the law,” said Twala. Three Radzuma brothers, aged between 26 and 33, are accused of the murders and have not pleaded. Prosecutor Mashudu Nekhumbe read out a decision of deputy director of public prosecutions to withdraw the case against Thabo Sibanze from Eswatini but said he would be prosecuted for being an illegal immigrant, intimidation and possession of stolen property. It was also decided Ndivhuwo wouldn’t be prosecuted for murder. However, he remained accused of conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder. His brothers would stand trial for the murders. Simon was facing 20 charges and Percy 27, including murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The two brothers will stand trial on 30 September.
