HE USED to wear orange overalls in prison but he’s now flying across the world in a suit, doing business. Prison changed the life of former hijacker Solly Mankga as he left with multiple qualifications. He told Daily Sun that he obtained a BA in philosophy, politics and economics, a diploma in human resources and international computer software training programme behind bars. The 45-year-old from Midrand, Joburg, said he was arrested for armed robbery and hijacking in 2002, and sentenced to 15 years. He was released in 2012. He completed matric in 2008, followed by all his qualifications. “The punishment of crime is serving time. In jail I learnt there is no short cut to success. It requires hard work and determination.” Solly said that being in prison made him miss out on a lot in life. “The most painful thing is that I spent 80% of my youth in prison, so I missed out on being a productive young person,” he said. Solly embraced the prison ministry that led to him continuing his studies. He’s the co-founder of Second Try Foundation. He is also in the import and export business, and does business in China, Dubai and Turkey.
