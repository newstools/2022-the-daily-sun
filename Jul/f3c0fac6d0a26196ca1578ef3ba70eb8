A 29-YEAR-OLD suspect linked to a Sobantu triple murder abandoned bail during his court appearance. The suspect made a brief appearance in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court on Thursday, 30 June. The suspect is accused of murdering gogo Madi Ndlela (65), her daughter Smangele Ndlela (46) and her granddaughter Mama Ndlela (8) on Monday night, 27 June. He had additional rape charges for the rapes of two of the deceased. The bodies of the three women were found by family members on Tuesday morning, 28 June at their home in Sobantu, Pietermaritzburg. Relative Xolani Ndlela (40) said they’ve never seen such brutality. He said his two brothers who live in the outside building didn’t hear any noise. “The suspect was not born in this area. He was in hiding here as he was wanted for another murder,” said Xolani. “The way he did it shows he has done this before.” KZN Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has expressed disappointment at the continuous incidents of the rape and murder of women and children in the province. “We are shocked by this incident of rape and murder,” she said. “Such disgusting acts show that we have people who have lost their moral compass and can’t even see what is wrong with such acts.” Khoza said the suspect was allegedly a repeat offender who’s currently on parole. KZN police spokeswoman Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said Mountain Rise police opened a docket with three counts of murder and two counts of rape. “Police questioned people in the area and the information received led them to the house of a 29-year-old man who was last seen with the victims,” she said. She said they were stunned to find the man in blood-stained clothes and he failed to provide police with a satisfactory reason for the stains. He was arrested and charged. He appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court, and he’ll be back on 7 July,” said Ngcobo.
