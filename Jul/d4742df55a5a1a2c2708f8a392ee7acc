ORLANDO Police Station commander Brigadier Nonhlanhla Kubeka said they have learnt some lessons from the shooting at Mdlalose’s tavern in Lahlumlenze, Nomzamo Park. Speaking during the oversight visit by Gauteng Legislature’s Portfolio Committee on Community Safety on Tuesday, 19 July, Kubeka described the incident as traumatic. “It was the worst incident in my career. I was among the first people who went to the scene. Even today when I think about it, I still get goosebumps,” she said. She said the lesson learnt was that if they had a reasonable number of members who could respond in time they could have saved the situation. She said the lesson the community, the police, and the government have learnt is that they should work together. “The community should also be taught to use 10 111.” She said the phone at the station had a signal problem because they had no power and the phones weren’t ringing. Kubeka said the investigation was still at a sensitive stage but all leads were being followed. “I must confirm that the suspects have been identified. We know who they are.” General Max Masha said the shooting was not just a random shooting. “It was organised, planned and there was a motive. The suspects will be arrested any time now,” he said.
