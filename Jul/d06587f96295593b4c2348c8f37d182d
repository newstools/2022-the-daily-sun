THE South African Police Service (SAPS) has permanently removed 46 592 firearms from circulation in a period of six months. This follows a destruction process where firearms, ammunition and firearm parts that had either been seized during crime prevention operations, voluntarily surrendered or forfeited to the state were destroyed in Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng. On Friday, 8 July, 20 590 of the firearms were destroyed – 15 465 of them handguns while 2686 were rifles, 1855 shotguns and the rest firearm parts. In March, 26 002 were also destroyed, bringing the total number of firearms and parts destroyed to 46 592.? The process to demolish the firearms was overseen by the commissioner Lieutenant-General Michael Mohlala. All firearms were subjected to ballistic testing to determine if they were utilised in any crime, and the SAPS confirmed that they had all been cleared. Of the 46 592 firearms, the majority were either surrendered and voluntarily handed over to the state during the 2019/2020 as well as the 2020/2021 Firearms Amnesty period, confiscated and seized during intelligence-driven operations, routine stop and searches as well as tip-offs from community members. The SAPS would continue to intensify operations to detect and remove illegal firearms and ammunition from the streets as they posed a threat to the safety and security of citizens.
