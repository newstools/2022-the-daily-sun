FREE STATE cops arrested six hijacking suspects in Sasolburg on Thursday, 7 July. According to Sergeant Josephine Rani, it was alleged that cops were on-duty when they received information of a truck being hijacked on the R59 towards R57 off-ramp. Rani said upon arrival, cops found the truck driver being accompanied by officers from the traffic department. “Four suspects, aged between 18 and 40, who were not successful on their mission, had already fled on foot. A search ensued and one suspect was found hiding in a small dam. The remaining three were found hiding in the bushes, and all four were arrested,” Rani said in a statement. She added that further investigation revealed two more suspects said to be part of those arrested. “These suspects, a man and woman, were caught driving a silver Mercedes-Benz near a shopping complex in Vaalpark,” Rani said. All six suspects were expected to appear before the Sasolburg Magistrates Court on Monday, 11 July, facing charges of hijacking and contravention of the Immigration Act. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane praised all role players in securing the arrests. “Hijackings have been a pain for the district. It is high time we show these suspects that they cannot do as they please. We are surely stamping the authority of the state,” Motswenyane said.
