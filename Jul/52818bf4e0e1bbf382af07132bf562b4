RESIDENTS from Slovo in Springs, Ekurhuleni claim they’ve been without electricity for two months. On Wednesday, 20 July, they came out in large numbers to stand on the busy Welgedaght Road. Others manned the ends so no cars passed through and no one went to work. School kids did not go to school. Residents, who said they meant business, told Daily Sun they were tired of being taken for granted. “We are not going to fight or vandalise any property, but no car is going to use this road,” they said. The residents refused to move until they were addressed by officials from Ekurhuleni Municipality. “We are tired of being taken for granted. We have a list of reference numbers collected from residents as they called Springs customer care centre to fix the electricity,” they said. They said since Slovo came into being 26 years ago, no transformer was ever serviced. “We visited the energy department telling them part of the problem could be the transformers, which have not been serviced for a long time. We don’t remember seeing technicians coming here,” said community leader Lucky Limako. Residents also complained of high bills and unemployment opportunities. “I pay over R1 000 a month to bring my services bill down, but it looks like I’m pouring water in a broken bucket and it does not make a difference. My bill is ridiculously high,” said a woman. Another community leader, Pinkie Moyane, said they were excluded from job opportunities on projects meant to benefit their area. “They know most of our residents are not working but instead of employing our people, they come with their own workers. Slovo is a poor area,” she said. Municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said they were aware that the transformers weren’t working, and they’ll check with the energy department of Springs for recent developments.
