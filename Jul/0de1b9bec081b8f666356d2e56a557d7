 Kaizer Chiefs coach Arthur Zwane says although the club are in a rebuilding phase, they have to produce results immediately. Zwane was given the head coach job permanently at the end of last season and tasked with turning the club’s fortunes around. Chiefs have been punching well below their weight in the past couple of seasons. They are currently enduring a painful seven-year trophy drought with all eye now on Zwane to end it. He has been fully backed in the transfer window with the club signing players such as Ashley du Preez, Zitha Kwinika, Kamohelo Mahlatse and more. “As much as we are in a rebuilding phase, we will still go for the kill,” said Zwane. “Kaizer Chiefs is a team with a rich history and a culture of winning so we won’t go into the season with ambitions that do not match the stature of this club. As much as we are rebuilding, we still want the best results.” DStv Premiership 2022/23 Round 1 fixturesFriday, 5 AugustCape Town City v Mamelodi Sundowns, Cape Town Stadium – 19:30Saturday, 6 AugustGolden Arrows v Richards Bay, Princess Magogo Stadium – 15:00Marumo Gallants v Stellenbosch, New Peter Mokaba Stadium – 15:00Orlando Pirates v Swallows FC, Orlando Stadium – 15:00Royal AM v Kaizer Chiefs, Chatsworth Stadium – 17:30Maritzburg United v Sekhukhune United, Harry Gwala Stadium – 20:00Sunday, 7 AugustTS Galaxy v AmaZulu, Mbombela Stadium – 15:00SuperSport United v Chippa United, Lucas Moripe Stadium – 17:30
