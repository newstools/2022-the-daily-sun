THERE’S a proverbial phrase that states “revenge is a dish best served cold”. And Bafana Bafana can attest to that statement after they were booted out of the Cosafa Cup quarter-finals by Mozambique at King Zwelithini Stadium on Wednesday night. The Mambas defeated Bafana Bafana 5-4 on penalties after the two sides played to a goalless draw in regular time. This was the repeat of last year’s Cosafa Cup semi-final where Bafana thumped Mozambique 3-0 and went all the way to win the tournament. However, this time around they will not defend their title. Bafana are now going to play Madagascar in the Plate semi-finals. The youthful Bafana squad displayed a commanding performance, but it was not enough as they could not crack Mozambique’s defence. It was an interesting first half as the SA youngsters did not show fear of the Mambas. They created a couple of opportunities, but lack of experience and composure saw them firing blanks and went to the break tied on 0-0. In the second half, players such as Thapelo Maseko were all over Mozambique’s defence but luck was not on their side as the match ended with the same score line and was decided on penalties. Antonio van Wyk, Rowan Human and Siyanda Msani all missed their penalties and Mozambique only missed two and emerged victorious. The inexperienced squad is led by national team assistant coach Helman Mkhalele in the absence of Hugo Broos. In this youthful squad, Ethan Brooks (21) is regarded as a senior player as he has been fielded in Broos’s line-ups for bigger stages that include the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) and Fifa World Cup qualifiers. Most of the players in the team are playing in the DStv Diski Challenge while others ply their trade in the National First Division.
