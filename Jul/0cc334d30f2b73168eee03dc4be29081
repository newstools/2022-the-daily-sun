ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has said that they’ll approach all political parties in Parliament to engage on a motion of no confidence against President Cyril Ramaphosa. Malema was briefing the media at the party’s headquarters, Winnie Madikizela Mandela House in Marshalltown, Joburg on Thursday, 14 July. He claimed that after the Phala Phala incident came to light, Ramaphosa wanted to quit. “Ramaphosa has confessed to his caucus, his own faction that he’s got no defence on the money. The money was illegal and he has no answers. Therefore, he must step down. “It is alleged that, among others, it was Zamani Saul, Oscar Mabuyane and Stella Ndabeni, who said to him he must not resign and they will defend him. But the president made concession to his faction and to his core that he has no moral defence to those things,” said Malema. Malema said his party will also engage in a national shutdown to remove Ramaphosa from office, and called on all South Africans to join. He said Ramaphosa was not above the law and that no one was above the law.

Malema added that when it came to the motion of no confidence, their approach was going to be different in that they’re going to speak to all political parties in Parliament, including the DA and the ANC. He said he was confident that the ANC would accept that the motion of no confidence should be put before the president, if he does not step down. Malema also called for the removal of the police minister. “Well, we don’t have a police minister and we made this call a long time ago,” he said. He called for KZN police chief General Nhlanhla Mkwanazi to be police commissioner. “When you look at him you see a man in uniform, who is disciplined and determined to deal with crime in South Africa,” he said.
