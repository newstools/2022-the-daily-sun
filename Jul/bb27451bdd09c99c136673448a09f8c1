BONGANI Mtshali says he was left devastated when the love of his life stole from him. He told Daily Sun that he ended up becoming the laughing stock among his friends because of his umjolo shenanigans. The 35-year-old from Protea Glen, Soweto, said he returned to an empty shack and a broken heart on Tuesday, 5 July, after his girlfriend of three months cleaned him out. Bongani said he had met the woman on Facebook and on Monday, 4 July, she finally visited him after spending months speaking every day. “We were already talking about marriage and kids,” he said. Bongani said the woman told him that she was from Newcastle, KZN, and he thought the fact that she had travelled so far to visit showed that she was genuinely interested. “We stayed up all night talking and poking. “I didn’t even care that I had to go to work the following day. I was just ecstatic to be with the love of my life.” He said the following morning, he went to work and left the woman in his bed. “I called her from work but I couldn’t get hold of her. I thought she was still sleeping because we had a wild night.” However, he came back from work only to find all his belongings missing from his shack, except the bed. Bongani said he didn’t bother to open a case because he didn’t think he would get justice, especially after leaving a stranger in his home. His cousin, Mandla Nkosi (33), said he had warned Bongani not to open his heart to someone he had just met. “I told him a friend was scammed by ladies he met on social media, but he didn’t want to listen.” Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo advised Bongani to open a case.
