MADALA Griffiths Makwela (72) and his sweetheart gogo Rosina Makwela (54) are never apart. The two from Witsand kasi in Atlantis, Western Cape, are the talk of the kasi. Griffiths and Rosina, who share a two-roomed shack, said they have been together for 15 years and met at church after they both got divorced from their previous partners. They told Daily Sun they believed their relationship was a match made in heaven because their time together had been the happiest of their lives. Madala’s advice to others to have a happy marriage was to remember that alcohol causes strife in relationships. “When people are drunk, they do things they would never do if they were sober. In my view, it is something that is problematic,” he said. Resident Nombeko Mkhaliphi (45) said she saw the couple sunbathing in the afternoon. “I think they are what people call soulmates. I admire their love,” she said. Mlamli Joka (34) said it was her goal to find someone who loved her like Rosina loved madala. “Madala also gives her the love back,” she said. Rosina does not drink either and she advised young couples to keep things simple. “Drink more water than alcohol. Booze does not only ruin your marriage but also your love,” she said.
