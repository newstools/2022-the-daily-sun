MAMELODI Sundowns’ new goalkeeper, Ronwen Williams, will have to be patient and wait his turn to get a chance to play for the treble champions. The Bafana Bafana skipper was signed last week by Downs from Tshwane neighbours SuperSport United. Williams was a spectator during Saturday’s Prince Mangosuthu Legacy Cup at Ulundi Stadium, in which the Brazilians featured. According to Downs co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi, the majority of the players who played the first 75 minutes against Richards Bay in the semi-final of the Prince Mangosuthu Legacy Cup are set to start when the Brazilians start the defence of their DStv Premiership title against Cape Town City at DHL Stadium on 5 August. So it might take a bit of time for Williams to see action at the Tshwane giants. Mngqithi and co-coaches Rhulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela opted to start with Reyaad Pieterse in goal. Sundowns lost 4-2 on penalties after Bay’s Nkanyiso Zungu beat Kennedy Mweene with the last spot kick, after the veteran Zambian had replaced Pieterse in goal. The teams were tied 1-1 at full-time. “We played 75 minutes. We took out the rest of the squad in that time because that was important for me,” said Mngqithi. “Because we are preparing for the first match of the season, and we knew something (injuries) can happen, unfortunately we cannot lose players through injuries. So it was important that we don’t risk too much. We are happy the ones who played 90 minutes were able to play without any injuries.” Mngqithi praised the DStv Premiership newcomers: “I’m happy for Richards Bay, and I am very excited about them. But it is still a long way and lots of work to do. “But I’m just so happy that, for a team that got promoted, they were able to hold their own.”
