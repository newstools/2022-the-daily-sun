HEALTH department’s Popo Maja was among three senior officials who got a slap on the wrist after being found guilty of awarding a phony communications contract to Digital Vibes. Former minister Dr Zweli Mkhize was suspended by President Cyril Ramaphosa last June for his role. The department announced the outcomes of a disciplinary hearing involving the three officials following investigations by an independent forensic audit firm and the Special Investigating Unit. Maja was found guilty on two of four charges, deputy director-general Dr Anban Pillay was found guilty on one and Shireen Pardesi was also found guilty on one. Spokesman Foster Mohale said the department, through the office of the state attorney, appointed an independent senior counsel to preside over the disciplinary hearing. He said it received the report on 6 June. “The presiding officer requested the department to make submissions into possible sanctions and allowed the legal representatives of the employees to make representations on mitigating factors. “The chairman considered the evidence, his findings and representations by the parties.” Mohale said they also considered that all those charged were first-time offenders and there was no evidence suggesting that they benefitted. “Pillay will receive a final written warning valid for 15 months and suspension without pay for three months, to be followed by salary level demotion for 12 months. “Maja will receive a final written warning valid for 12 months and salary level demotion for 12 months while Pardesi proposed that she be allowed to resign from the department with immediate effect. That was agreed by all parties and confirmed by the presiding officer,” he said.
