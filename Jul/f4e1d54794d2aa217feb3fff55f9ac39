AFTER weeks of searching, the body of the missing Soweto boy Khayelethu Magadla has finally been found. This was confirmed by Joburg EMS spokeswoman, Nana Redebe on Saturday, 02 July 2022. Magadla fell into a manhole in Dlamini on 12 June 2022 while playing with his friends. On Thursday, 30 June residents of Soweto came together and hosted a candlelight ceremony, sending love and prayers to the family. They were also praying that God reveals where the young man is and their prayers have been answered. Redebe said the body of Khayalethu was found near Eldorado Park Cemetery. She said today at about 12:23, Khayalethu was recovered by a rescue and recovery team comprising 35 EMS officials, Hazmat and Urban Search Technicians, Water unit, K-9 unit, Air wing, Delta Scan, Ambulances from Gauteng province, and 60 members of Joburg Water. "Khayalethu was found from the splitter chamber on the first manhole towards the samp situated near the Eldorado Cemetery," said Radebe. She also said the EMS specialised team has consistently continued with the search throughout the challenging pipeline system. "The Urban Search and Rescue teams have covered at least 20km from Dlamini to Eldorado Park," said Radebe. She also stated that Joburg Water has assisted immensely with the drainage of water from different sewer systems. "We send our deepest condolences to the family in this time of difficulty and hope they find closure now that Khayalethu has been found," said Radebe.
