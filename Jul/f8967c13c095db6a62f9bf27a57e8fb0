ADVOCATE Nqobizitha Mlilo, the lawyer of accused two and three in the Hillary Gardee murder case, has told the court that he received death threats from a political grouping. “Certain members and leaders of a political grouping told me and the brother of accused number two that this will end in tears. There will be graves and will do anything for Hillary Gardee. I am acting on instruction that I am being paid. It means I am acting on a mandate. They told me they are trained to kill and they will kill,” he said. The only political grouping that had been outside staging a picket is the Economic Freedom Fighters. Mlilo also addressed the court on the possibility of him being arrested for conspiracy. On Tuesday, while testifying in the bail hearing of Sipho Mkhatshwa, investigating Colonel Thamsanqa Mkhaliphi told the court that the state had witnesses who had heard a conversation between his clients and co-accused Mkhatshwa, when they were conspiring to kill a state witness. Mlilo was said to have been in the holding cells with them when the conversation occurred on 9 June, according to Mkhaliphi. “State advocate Ntsika Mpolweni suggested that this issue would arise and in his view, I was conflicted and I should consider to withdraw appearing on behalf of accused number two and three,” Mlilo said. He said he decided to raise the issue with his clients and give them an option to find someone else or retain him. He said his clients had opted to retain his services despite his possible arrest, which may or may not cause delays in their bail application. “In the event the stats decide to do what is necessary, I am available. They should tell me where and what time,” he said, in reference to the possible arrest. Mlilo maintained his innocence and denied any knowledge of the issues raised by the investigating officer. The matter was postponed to 8 August.
