A 64-YEAR-OLD madala allegedly killed his 35-year-old son on Saturday, 9 July in Kwanobuhle, Eastern Cape. He and his son allegedly had an argument that day, following which he then went to his bedroom and returned with his licensed firearm and allegedly shot his son twice in the chest and left arm. Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the victim ran out into the street and collapsed. He was taken to hospital by a resident but died of his injuries. Naidu said: “The suspect was arrested at the hospital while he was also receiving treatment. His second son (39) assaulted him with a brick after hearing of the shooting.” A case of murder is under investigation and cops seized the madala’s 9mm firearm. He will appear in the Kariega Magistrates Court on 11 July, facing murder charges.
