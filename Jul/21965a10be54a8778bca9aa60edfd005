A FUNERAL home owner accused of illegally selling body parts is facing jail time. Megan Hess from Colorado, USA, appeared in the federal court on Tuesday, 5 July, where she pleaded guilty of fraud by giving clients fake ashes. According to cbsnews.com, the 45-year-old woman was arrested with her mother in 2020, where they were charged with six counts of fraud. They were also charged with three counts of illegal transportation of hazardous materials. Daily Mail reported that FBI agents found that Hess had forged dozens of body-donor consent forms and allegedly gave one family an urn of concrete dust, instead of their loved one’s ashes.

Hess faces 20 years in prison after entering a plea, and other charges will be dropped as per the agreement. Cbsnews.com reported that on many occasions, Hess and Koch sold body parts to scientists for research purposes without the families’ knowledge. “Selling organs such as hearts, kidneys and tendons for transplant is illegal in the USA. But the sale of cadavers and body parts for use in research or education, which is what Hess did, is not regulated by federal law,” Reuters reported. Hess is set to be sentenced in January and a change of plea hearing for Koch is scheduled for 12 July.
