 The Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) increased the repo
rate by 75 basis points. The increase means that the
repo rate will be 5.50 percent per year beginning on 22 July. This is the fourth
consecutive increment following a two 25 basis points hike in November and in
January. The repo rate was hiked by
50 basis points at the May meeting. On Thursday, SARB Governor
Lesetja Kganyago said three members of the Committee preferred the announced
increase. “One member preferred a 100
basis points increase. Another member preferred a 50 basis point increase,” he
said.  Kganyago said:”A prudent
public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered
price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains would
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the
broader economy." He said economic and
financial conditions were expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable
future. Monetary policy decisions
will remain data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook
in this uncertain environment. Kganyago said the MPC will
examine temporary price shocks with a focus on potential second-round effects
and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. “The Bank will continue to
keep a close eye on the funding markets for signs of stress,” he said. A higher global oil price
and rand weakness contributed to higher expected fuel price inflation for this
year at 38.9% up from 31.2% and to 4.5% in 2023 up from -0.3%.
