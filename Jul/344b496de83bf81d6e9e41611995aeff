MZANSI is angry with police officers for confiscating fruit and vegetables from street vendors. People across the country have come out to say that the Joburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officers have been treating vendors unfairly as they are just trying to make a living. Vendor Mathapelo Nare (32) said she used her savings to start selling fruit and vegetables in the Joburg CBD after the firm she was working for shut down last year. She said she didn’t know she needed paperwork to sell and the cops came and took all her stock. “I wish they had educated me a little more about what I needed to do but all they did was take my things,” she said.  Lethabo Mathibedi (29) from Alexandra said on 2 June, his stock was confiscated and he never recovered it. “I knew I needed papers but I wasn’t sure where to go. They need to hold meetings with communities to educate them about these things,” he said. ALSO READ |
Please bring our baby Hlelokuhle back! Metro police spokesman Xolani Fihla said there were special stands for informal trading and any person who wanted to conduct business needed to apply to the council. He said police could impound the property of any trader if they suspected it was being used for informal trading.  Fihla said if any informal trader felt they had been mistreated, they should call the Metro police’s anti- corruption line. and get in touch with its internal affairs unit. “They can also report any form of corruption or misconduct by going directly to the internal affairs unit’s office on Village Main Road and Loveday Street in Wemmer,” he said. “A WhatsApp line at 063 253 1928 has also been introduced to report any inappropriate acts by Metro cops.” Fihla advised informal traders to take the name of the cop impounding goods and their car’s registration.
