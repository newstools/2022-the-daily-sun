HOME Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi launched the Border Management Authority (BMA) guards at the Beitbridge border post in Musina, Limpopo, on Thursday, 14 July. Motsoaledi said this was aimed at strengthening security at the border. He also handed over cars to the authority. He unveiled the first group of border guards during the ceremony, who underwent physical and fitness assessments before deployment. He said the BMA guards were recruited from villages next to the border and the authority was incubated under the department. Motsoaledi said guards would be strategically deployed along segments of the border, and welcomed 200 qualified guards. He added that the BMA also wanted to promote optimal cross-border trade, that would become fully established in April 2023. “The initiative is expected to play a key role towards tackling issues of border security,” he said.  Beitbridge has been marred with a stream of problems, including trucking congestion during peak seasons, illegal cross-border movement and smuggling. Motsoaledi said the key functions of the guards were to enforce compliance of immigration laws at ports of entry and process all illegal migrants for deportation to their respective countries of origin. It was also to conduct access control in informal community crossing points. The guards would also help to eliminate illicit cross-border movement of goods, including countering human and wildlife trafficking.
