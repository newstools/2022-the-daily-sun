SITHEMBILE Mthembu had the option to drop out of school and focus on giving birth to her baby. But she chose to write her exam in the labour ward while in a lot of pain. Sithembile was admitted to Addington Hospital on 24 June, the day she had to write her ICT Innovation and Emerging Technology exam. But it didn’t stop her writing from her hospital bed because she was so determined to finish her diploma in record time. She gave birth to a baby girl, Siphosethu Qoza, now three weeks old. “I had to push for my test before pushing the baby out. I had no other option because I was funded by NSFAS and had to make sure I pass all my modules so I graduate in time,” she said. The 23-year-old from Mayville in Durban, who was doing her Library and Information Studies Diploma at Durban University of Technology, was proud to have triumphed against all odds. She was among the students who graduated at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Durban International Convention Centre on Friday, 15 July. She said despite missing out on classes due to data and connectivity challenges and having NSFAS as her only source of funding, she also had a baby in her final study year. “The doctors shouted at me, accusing me of stressing the baby, but I continued. I wanted to make sure I excelled in my exams.” Having NSFAS as her only income wasn’t easy but she knew she could not call home because of the financial struggle she’d left behind. Sithembile plans to study to PhD level and publish a book.
