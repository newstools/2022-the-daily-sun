TWO former Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) employees have been arrested, along with their wives, in connection with a fraudulent Eskom contract. One couple was bust in Durban, KZN, while the other was arrested in Middleburg, Mpumalanga, on Tuesday, 12 July. It is alleged that they received cash and cars from a company ABB had sub-contracted, called Impulse International. Investigating Directorate (ID) spokeswoman Sindisiwe Seboka said the raids were conducted at the premises of all accused in a joint stakeholder initiative between the ID, the Hawks and Sars. “This is the third seminal matter the ID is enrolling as committed to by the National Prosecuting Authority,” she said. The Swiss company was awarded a R2,2 billion control and instrumentation contract for Kusile in 2015 and subcontracted some of the work to Impulse. Fin24 previously reported that former acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko was accused of promising ABB about R6,5 billion in future contracts, if it sub-contracted work on Kusile to Impulse International – a company partially owned by his stepdaughter, Koketso Choma. Mohammed Essop Mooidheen and wife Raeesa Mooidheen appeared in the Durban Specialised Crimes Court, while Vernon and Aradhna Pillay appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court.
