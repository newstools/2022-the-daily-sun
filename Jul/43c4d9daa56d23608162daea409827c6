PUPILS at Job Rathebe Junior Secondary School want things to change. The toilets at the school in Orlando East, Soweto, are unusable and this has led to pupils having to relieve themselves in bushes or wait until home time. The issues at the school, which include a shortage of furniture and poor leadership, led to parents closing the school on Tuesday morning, 19 July. On their first day back after the holidays, pupils spent half of the day picketing outside with their parents. A Grade 9 pupil (15) told Daily Sun: “The toilets are in a bad shape. I don’t use them. I hold it in until after school.” He said they had complained but teachers didn’t listen. “We also have to share chairs because there aren’t enough,” he said. But not everyone was happy with the protest. Another Grade 9 pupil (16) said the disruption meant those who relied on the school’s feeding scheme would not be getting their meal for the day. The pupils told the SunTeam they were happy with their teachers but wanted the other issues dealt with. Concerned parent Refiloe Some said: “Whenever something bad happens, the principal doesn’t take responsibility.” Another parent, Lorraine Jegeh, said there were bushes at the back of the school where people sold dagga to kids. The Gauteng education department’s regional chief director, Dennis Makwakwa, said following a meeting, it was decided that a task team would be assembled to deal with the parents’ concerns. “We have given ourselves 14 days to resolve some of the problems. “The department has appointed a service provider who will be going to fix the ablution facilities tomorrow (20 July),” he said. He said a caretaker principal was appointed but would not say what would happen to the current principal.
