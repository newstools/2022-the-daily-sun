THE seven people killed in the farm attack in Kestell will be buried on Saturday, 23 July. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela called for calm after residents threatened to take the law into their own hands, following the brutal killing of six women and a teenager on Lismor farm last Friday. She asked residents not to attack families of the accused, after members of one had to leave Kestell after alleged threats. “Leave innocent family members alone. “No parent can send their son or grandson to assassinate people,” said Ntombela at the Kestell multi-purpose hall on Wednesday, 20 July, where a community meeting was held. She said that the provincial government will ensure that victims are buried in a dignified manner.  Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said: “The post-mortem results have shown that two women were raped before being murdered. Rape charges will be added as soon as the accused are brought back when court resumes on 14 September.” John Moloi, the father of victim Lerato Moloi (32), said: “We want the prosecuting authority to fast-track the prosecution of those evil killers.” Provincial MEC for police William Bulwane confirmed that 20 people had been brutally murdered in the Maluti-a-Phofung area within a year. “The area has many illegal guns in the hands of criminals. We cannot give criminals the means to terrorise residents.”
