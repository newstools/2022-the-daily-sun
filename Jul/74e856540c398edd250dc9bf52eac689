A FAMILY doesn’t know which doors to knock on as they need help to start afresh. This after they lost everything in a fire on Sunday, 3 July. The family has asked SunReaders to help them with anything as they had nothing left. Siphiwe Sibiya (32) from Braamfischerville, Soweto, told Daily Sun that their house got burnt while he and his wife were running errands. He said his wife dropped him off in Dobsonville and drove to Joburg.  Everything was going well until his wife called to tell him to go home as the house was on fire. “For a moment, I thought she was joking or pranking me. I was in disbelief,” said Siphiwe. “As I was approaching my home, I saw huge smoke and it sunk in that our house was really on fire.” READ: Mum, kids burn to death in shack fire! Siphiwe said they suspect the fire was the result of load shedding. “Electricity went off at around 8am and came back at 3pm,” he said, adding that they were currently living in a friend’s backroom together with their three children. “We’re only left with the clothes we were wearing on the day. We would really like some help,” said Siphiwe. His wife, Pretty Klaas (40), said their home had everything they had ever wanted and they lost valuables worth about R70 000.  “We sell blankets and clothes for a living, and we had just recently stocked. All that is gone,” said Pretty. Joburg EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said the reason behind the fire was being investigated and no injuries or fatalities were reported.
