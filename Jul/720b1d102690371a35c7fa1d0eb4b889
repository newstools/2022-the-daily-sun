TWO taxi operators were allegedly shot by a frustrated motorist outside Hazyview, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday, 6 July. One was killed, while another is fighting for his life in hospital. Drama unfolded when a massive group of taxi operators shut down shopping malls in Hazyview and Mkhuhlu before barricading the road leading to the Kruger National Park with taxis. Residents and visitors travelling to and from the park were left desperate. Unfortunately, a family of five which was travelling towards Mkhuhlu got caught up with the fuming protesters who blockaded the road with taxis. A bystander said an altercation broke out between the protesters and the family’s driver, who was negotiating to pass through. He said things turned ugly when another taxi emerged and this resulted in a serious fight. In the chaos, the car driver fired several warning shots, which hit two of his attackers. His sister-in-law was also accidentally shot. But the driver eventually managed to flee along with his family and the bleeding woman. The other injured victims were rushed by a taxi to hospital. Police spokesman, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, confirmed that a family of five travelling towards Mkhuhlu from Hazyview came across a road blockage at a bridge near Sanibonani Lodge. “The road was blocked with taxis. The driver tried to negotiate to pass, but was attacked by a mob of alleged taxi people. Another taxi came with more attackers. “In the commotion, the driver allegedly fired two warning shots. He also hit two attackers. During the shooting, the family driver’s sister-in-law was also shot accidentally. But the driver and his family escaped and took the wounded woman to Sabi Hospital,” said Mohlala. He said the two injured operators were taken by taxi to Matikwane Hospital, where one was certified dead on arrival. “The driver and his son were arrested at Sabi Hospital,” he said.
