A 59-YEAR-OLD woman pleaded guilty to 867 counts of theft at the Middelburg Regional Court on Friday, 22 July. Linda Ebersohn was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, of which five years were suspended for five years, on the condition that she’s not convicted of an offence during the period of suspension. According to Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, the sentence comes after incidents which happened between 1998 and 2017, when the accused worked as a debtors and creditors clerk. Sekgotodi said the accused created false and used existing creditors’ particulars on the system for payments to her account. “She further distributed the money to her husband and two children’s accounts. “The matter was reported to the Hawks’ Middelburg-based Serious Commercial Crime Investigation for further investigation. The investigation was completed and the accused was linked to the crime,” Sekgotodi said in a statement. She said Ebersohn was arrested on 27 November 2018 and her family members were also arrested and charged. “During the sentencing on Friday, the charges against the other three were withdrawn when Ebersohn pleaded guilty,” Sekgotodi added.
