VRYBURG cops have arrested a 43-year-old taxi passenger on Saturday, 9 July for possession of 21 suspected stolen sheep. K9 Unit members were patrolling the N14 between Vryburg and Kuruman when they spotted a suspicious-looking taxi stationary on the road. Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said upon approaching the taxi for enquiries, the cops saw two individuals fleeing the scene, leaving the 43-year-old man behind. “A search led to the discovery of 21 sheep, found loaded into the minibus. The suspect was arrested after failing to account for their possession and the vehicle was impounded,” Funani said.  Initial investigations showed the taxi ran out of petrol while the suspects were travelling to a yet to be determined destination from Kuruman in the Northern Cape. The sheep were allegedly stolen in Tsineng Village. The lawful owner of the sheep was traced through marks on the animals. Investigations are underway and the suspect is expected to appear in the Vryburg Magistrates Court on Monday, 11 July.
