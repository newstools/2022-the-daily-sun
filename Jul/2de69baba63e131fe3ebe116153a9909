THABANG Ngobeni (24) told Daily Sun that he visited a sangoma in April over a misunderstanding with his girlfriend. But instead of getting help for their relationship, the sangoma told him that his ancestors wanted him to be a sangoma. Last November he went to thwasa. But now Thabang is back home in Seabe, North West, without completing his training – and the family no longer has their Ford Meteor and has allegedly lost about R16 500. Thabang said the sangoma, from Hammanskraal, Tshwane, told him that he must train, and allegedly gave him a girlfriend who was staying at his home. “He told me that my ancestors wanted me to have two wives. I hear the voice of the sangoma calling me. He tells me that he is powerful and no one will do anything to him,” claimed Thabang. His father, Jacob Mabula (45), said he wanted his money and car back from the sangoma. “And he didn’t even complete the job,” said Jacob, adding that he must be prevented from practising as he would cause more harm to innocent people. Thabang’s mother, Joyce Ngobeni (41), said her son told her amadlozi wanted him to do their work. She said the sangoma even named him Dumezulu. She claimed they bought two goats, a tent, cases of alcohol and two bottles of brandy for the graduation. “The sangoma left us poor,” she claimed. Joyce said that she suspected the sangoma might have bewitched them. “When they performed rituals in his indumba, my husband came out chewing muthi and later gave him his car. He also bewitched Thabang because he is always talking about him as if he is with him.” Sangoma George Malatjie said Thabang ran away before completing training. He said the family paid him with a car that was in such bad condition it had to be towed. He denied getting money from them, except what they spent on rituals. President of African Dingaka Organisation Andrew Somo urged healers to join. “We are against healers who accept property for payment,” he said, adding that they would engage the sangoma.
