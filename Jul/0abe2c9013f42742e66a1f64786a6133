THE ANC KZN elective conference, that was scheduled to kick-off at 10am this morning, is running behind schedule as delegates are still locked in caucuses in their hotels. Provincial spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela told Daily Sun that the delay was caused by delegates who had not fetched their tags so the conference could start. “We are ready to start. We are waiting for delegates to come and collect their name tags,” he said. The last-minute caucuses are an indication that some branches have not yet settled on their preferred leadership. And, they could signal a long-drawn-out affair as reports were emerging that the all-powerful eThekwini region had decided not to support any of the three candidates who had thrown their names in the hat for chairmanship.

Now, it appears that this could be another slate entering the race backed reportedly by eThekwini, that is headed by corruption-accused Zandile Gumede, and who could be nominated from the floor. She is expected to turn it down due to the step-aside rule. Daily Sun has also learnt that her supporters are unhappy with the amended rule, that bars her from contesting or attending the conference. They were gearing themselves to raise the matter at the beginning of the conference.
