THE Roodepoort Police Station has been without running water for months. The admin staff and police officers said the crisis started in November. Only one toilet is currently working and that is for management, they told Daily Sun. When members of the SunTeam visited the police station in the west of Joburg earlier this week, they were hit by an unpleasant smell coming from the charge office. When they asked to use the toilet, they were told they were out of order. ALSO READ | Tavern owner, assistant left dead and naked in

A cop said: “The pipes are very old. Every now and then the toilets block. In November more toilets were affected and there was little access to running water. In the end, the taps ran dry.” The cop said only two toilets were working at the time. “One for management and the other for the rest of the staff. Men pee at the back of the building but women can’t do that,” said the cop. The cop said they go to surrounding shops and petrol stations to use the toilet and ask for water to boil for tea. One cop said they couldn’t be productive when they spent time outside the premises, looking for places to relieve themselves. At the time of going to print, after numerous attempts, the police had not responded to the inquiry sent to them.
