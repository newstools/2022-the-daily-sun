RONWEN Williams’ move to Mamelodi Sundowns could be completed by next week, at earliest this week, SunSport has reliably learnt. Early this month, SuperSport CEO Stan Matthews said new coach Gavin Hunt set up a meeting with the player to decide on his future. However, by the look of things, Williams’ deal to the reigning PSL champions is as good as done, and it will see Ricardo Goss switching to Matsatsantsa a Pitori. SuperSport are currently camping at the Ranch Resort in Limpopo in their pre-season training, and Williams is not part of the team. “As I stand right now, there has been discussions. He (Williams) is not here,” confirmed the club coach Hunt. He went on to explain: “Put one and one together… obviously some things have to happen. He has been a great servant to the club for 19 years. I gave him his debut some years ago, so the opportunity has come for him and he cannot deny the opportunity he has been given. “I do not know if it has been done as we stand, and obviously by the minute by the hour things are happening.” Without a doubt, the move will see Goss getting the much-needed game time as he has not been able to break it into Sundowns star-studded lineup since he joined the club in September 2020. Sundowns are currently in Durban after leaving Rustenburg to continue their pre-season preparations. The DStv Premiership champions will take part in the Mangosuthu Legacy Cup this weekend.
