INTERPOL South Africa has arrested a 28-year-old Nigerian national who is believed to be part of a cybercrime ring involved in phishing, internet scams and money laundering. James Junior Aliyu was arrested at an upmarket estate in Sandton, Joburg, earlier this week following a takedown operation. Police spokesperson Colonel Athlenda Mathe said, “Just after 10:00 on Wednesday, 29 June 2022, members from the Interpol National Crime Bureau (NCB) in Pretoria with the assistance from members of the SAPS Gauteng Highway Patrol Unit swooped in on the upmarket estate where they effected the arrest.” Mathe said the arrest follows a widespread investigation involving law enforcement authorities from South Africa (SA) and the United States of America (USA). “The cybercrime suspect who has been conducting his criminal activities from South Africa is accused of swindling dozens of US citizens millions in USD through email and text messages. “Authorities in the USA, where the investigation originated and where most of his alleged victims are based, have applied for his extradition.”Mathe said the suspect has already appeared before the Randburg Magistrates’ Court on the same day of his arrest and the matter has been remanded to 05 July 2022.
