A MADALA was shocked to hear strange noises coming from his genitals and a nightmare became reality. According to a new study published in the American Journal of Case Reports, the 72-year-old madala heard a “hissing” noise and was diagnosed as the first person in the world with a “whistling scrotum.” The madala, who had a swollen face, was rushed to a local emergency room complaining about his bizarre condition. The New York Post reported that an x-ray of the man’s chest revealed that he had “excessive” amounts of air floating in his body, causing his lungs to collapse. If left untreated, this could have permanently damaged his heart and lungs function, potentially leading to death, doctors reported. READ: Doctor: Pollution is shrinking 4-5s! Later, the primary source of the man’s strange whistling was discovered to be an open wound on the left side of his scrotum. The injury, which was caused by testicle surgery to reduce swelling five months ago, allowed some trapped air to escape. According to the report, his shortness of breath and swollen face were caused by complications. To remove the excess air, two plastic tubes were inserted into his chest. Dr Brant Bickford and colleagues wrote that the madala was transferred to another hospital for further treatment. His condition deteriorated further, with the amount of air trapped between his lungs and the chest wall increasing, which compelled doctors to add a new chest tube. Thankfully, his lungs recovered after three days in the hospital, the study noted, and after the recovery, the madala was released from the hospital in good condition.
