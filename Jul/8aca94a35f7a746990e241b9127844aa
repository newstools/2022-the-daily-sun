Experts claim this viper has killed more people than all other snakes combined. While its venom isn't the most lethal, that honour belongs to the inland taipan. The viper's "aggressiveness means it bites early and frequently. Most people find it near rocks because it blends in with them. When threatened, the viper condenses its body into an S-shape. It will also rub its scales together, producing a hissing sound as a warning to flee. If you are bitten, don't be alarmed; its venom is only lethal in less than 10% of people if untreated.
