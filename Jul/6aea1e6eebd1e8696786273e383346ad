THE third man who went missing after being kidnapped, along with murdered Success Mashele (34) and MacDuff Mashabane (33), was found dead in the nearby bushes, not far from the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 20 July. The three were allegedly kidnapped in broad daylight in Bushbuckridge, and beaten by a gang of people. They were led by a local businesswoman who accused them of stealing from her on Monday, 11 July. But they never came back. On Thursday, 14 July, a passersby bumped into the bodies of Mashabane and Mashele in the bushes and alerted the police. They were half-naked and wounded, lying in a pool of blood. Two men, who were arrested in connection with the killings, walked free on Monday due to insufficient evidence. ALSO READ |
