The Police in Mpumalanga are concerned about a series of fraudulent and scamming activities committed around Kwamhlanga. The cases of fraud are escalating around the Kwamhlanga area, especially at the shopping centres. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the warning comes after a couple of victims fell prey and were robbed of their money at the ATMs. Some of those criminal activities are said to have happened on 11 and 12 June 2022 respectively when one victim was at Phola Mall to withdraw money at an ATM and a suspect offered to assist her. “She did as she was told and didn't understand what was happening then her card didn’t come out of the machine. She waited but nothing came out and eventually went inside the bank to report the matter. While she was still in the bank, some of her money was withdrawn twice from her account. He said the second victim was also at the ATM at the same mall (Phola). Two suspects were at the ATM and the victim was in the queue for withdrawing cash when the same suspects told her to insert her card into the machine. She did and put her pin code and her card did not come out.  She waited for a few minutes then the security told her to go inside the bank to report the problem. While inside the bank, her money was also withdrawn from her account.” Cases of fraud were opened and an investigation is underway. “We request the community to be vigilant and not to request assistance from strangers. In addition, all suspicious activities must be reported to the police immediately,” said Mohlala.
