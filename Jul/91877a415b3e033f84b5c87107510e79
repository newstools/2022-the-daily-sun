IT’S been over a month since Eunice Nkuna mysteriously disappeared from her marital home in Magudu, Mpumalanga. The 48-year-old mother of three, who is a clerk at a local school, was last seen by her husband and kids. It is alleged they left her at home and when they came back, she was nowhere to be found. According to Eunice’s sister, Nomalanga Maziya, she last spoke to her sister on the phone on 25 May and she never indicated that she was planning to go somewhere. She said she sounded fine and didn’t say anything about leaving. Nomalanga told Daily Sun that what got the family more worried is that Eunice’s husband never reported her missing or informed the family about her disappearance until they realised her phone had been off for days. Nomalanga said the family is frustrated and struggling to cope. She said they have been to izangoma who told them that her was sister was in danger. “We’ve exhausted all our efforts now and hope whoever took her or kept her captive returns her safe.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said a missing person’s case was registered and police have been working with the family to find Eunice.
