IT was the day of wearing fashionable clothes dripping in honey-related colours at the popular Hollywoodbets Durban July which was held after a two-year break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Although some local celebs didn’t honour the theme of the day, Show Me the Honey, others dripped in gold, yellow and brown colours. Greyville Racecourse in Durban was the place to be on Saturday, 2 July. Fashion, entertainment in fenced marquees and betting were the order of the day. Mzansi celebs such as Somizi Mhlongo, Khuli Chana, Fundiswa Zwane, Ntokozo Dlamini, Gogo Maweni, Q Twins, DJ Sox, DJ Tira and many more attended the event. Somizi, who stole the show with his grand entrance and outfit designed by his stylist only known as Obakeng, told DailySun that it was amazing to be back at the Durban July after its absence of two years. “For me personally, it is the same as everyone else. It is a beacon of hope. It brings so much hope that not all hope is lost. ALSO READ: Top Skeem Saam actress dumps show! “We are very grateful for life more than anything else. We have made it.
