After a dramatic withdrawal in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial, Advocate Malesela Teffo has made another shocking U-turn. On 12 July Teffo shocked the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane and the country as a whole when he announced that he will longer be representing accused one to four. He cited a couple of reasons for his withdrawal including, the claims that Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela, the office of the Presidency and the Minister of Police wanted him out on the case. He said he felt disrespected and that it would be unfair for the accused to be subjected to an unfair trial because of the treatment he was receiving. But in a letter directed to the High Court, Teffo said he had a change of heart and decided that he will continue to represent them on their next court appearance, on Tuesday (2 August). But his decision to come back to the case came with conditions. Some of the demands included having all charges against him dropped, Minister of Police Bheki Cele being and called for the Prosecution of Kelly Khumalo. In the letter dated, 25 July Teffo said: "Be informed that I am not going to withdraw in this matter and give the State underserved due." "We have since resolved my withdrawal issue with the relevant stakeholders in this matter and I am still the Defence Counsel for accused 1 to 4," he said ‌Teffo went further to accuse the Presiding Judge, Maumela of bewitching him. He said Maumela, brought a sangoma to court and he was reliably told that the Sangoma came to make him collapse while in court. “The sangoma was fortunately witnessed by all the parties, when coming to consult with Judge Maumela in his chambers, at the time we were with him.” "I started to have nightmares after Judge Maumela brought the sangoma at court and his ill-treatment increased even before," he said.
