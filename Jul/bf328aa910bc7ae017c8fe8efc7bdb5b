A 33-YEAR-OLD man handed himself over at Swartkops Police Station on Monday, 25 July, for the alleged murder of his ex-girlfriend’s son. According to Colonel Priscilla Naidu, the suspect took Thabang Klaas (6) from his grandmother’s house in New Brighton, Eastern Cape, on Friday, 22 July, and went into the bushes in Swartkops where he allegedly strangled him. “The body of the child was found on Monday, 25 July, on a footpath in the bushes. “The suspect is detained on a charge of murder and the motive for the murder is suspected to be revenge against the ex-girlfriend,” Naidu said. She said the investigation is continuing and the suspect is expected to appear in the Gqeberha Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 27 July. Provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Nomthetheleli Mene, urged the community to report any suspected child abuse or neglect. “Children trust people they know, making them vulnerable to child abusers and murderers. “I urge communities to be the voice of the voiceless. Let’s stop the abuse and brutal attacks on our children,” she added.
