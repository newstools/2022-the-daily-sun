TWO suspects were caught transporting suspected stolen diesel with a police van that had been converted into a fuel tanker in Delmas, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday, 20 July. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said officers were conducting patrol duties on the N12 when they noticed a suspicious white Nissan NP300 bakkie with two occupants. “The vehicle, with a GP registration number plate, appeared to be heavily loaded and was covered with a black canvas. The police ordered the driver to stop, followed by a search. And when they removed the canvas, they discovered that the back had been converted into a diesel tank,” he said. Mohlala further said the two men, aged 29 and 34, were questioned in relation to the purchase of the diesel but failed to produce any proof. “They were detained and are facing charges of possession of suspected stolen diesel. The 29-year-old is also facing a charge of contravention of the Immigration Act.” Mohlala said the police confiscated about 500L of diesel, estimated to be worth R13 800. He said cops also found the registration number to be incorrect, hence the car was seized. It was also revealed to belong to the South African Police Service in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. “More charges are imminent and police can’t rule out the possibility of more arrests.”
