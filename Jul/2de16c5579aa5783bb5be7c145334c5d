WHEN Obed Motshwene (44) bought two motorbikes for a delivery business, he never thought it would tear his family apart. His parents, Gideon (68) and Lizzy (67) from Block P in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, are now at loggerheads with Obed’s son, Sifiso, (23) over them. They have accused him of stealing and using them for his own benefit. According to the couple, Obed bought the motorbikes for them so they could make extra money. They said when Obed was laid off work, he asked for advice on what kind of a business he should start for them. “While we were busy thinking about it, his son told him to buy bikes,” said Gideon, adding that they then bought two motorbikes. “This boy looked for two riders and also found a restaurant to help with deliveries. But the problem is, he didn’t consult us. We were not home when he came to take them,” he said.

Lizzy said the bikes were new when they were taken, but they never saw a profit. “My son is also suffering because of this. He is now forced to do piece jobs on farms,” she said, adding that they tried to get the bikes back with no luck. But according to Sifiso, he did not steal any bikes. He said they told him to look for riders, of which he did. “The riders lived in Tembisa. In December I lost my phone and their contacts. I haven’t been able to track them down,” he said. Sifiso said he told his father and grandfather to accompany him to Tembisa, but they refused. “I can’t go there alone. What if these people attack me? I’m still young so they won’t be intimidated by me,” he said. Gideon said they tried to report the matter to the police but were told to take it to a family or small claims court as it involved the family.
