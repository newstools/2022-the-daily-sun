KARABO Maluleka (26) wants to keep kids off the streets and out of harm’s way – and he believes the way to do it is through dance. Karabo from Unit 7 in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said he started Segarona Cultural Group, which performs at various events around the area and they also do street shows to market the group. The money they make during performances is divided among the kids so that they can buy lunch at school. “This group was formed in 2012 but the previous dancers have all grown up and some are now working. So, currently I am training children between the ages of 12 and 16. We perform at various events such as weddings, unveilings and many others,” he said. “We are trying to help the kids by keeping them off the streets. “We don’t want them to be involved in drugs or fall pregnant and that is why after school they are always here to practice. Those who need help with their homework are also assisted.” Karabo, who is also a chef, said he has opened a food joint in his kasi and that on the day of the opening he used the opportunity to showcase the group’s talent with an aim to market them and to attract more customers. Dancer Koketso Mabane (15) said she joined the group a few years ago and she believes it will take her far in terms of achieving her dream of becoming a singer. “To my friends out there, it is better to belong to groups such this one because our parents know that when we are not at home we are here practising,” she said.
