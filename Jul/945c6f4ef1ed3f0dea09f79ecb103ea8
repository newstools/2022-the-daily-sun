FORMER Orlando Pirates captain Happy Jele has been tipped to join Royal AM after leaving the Soweto giants. Jele, a Pirates legend who spent 16 years at the club, will be leaving after his contract was not renewed. SunSport understand Jele will be heading to KwaZulu-Natal to join Royal AM where he will become a key member of the team as they look to challenge next season. The 35-year-old has seen little game time at Pirates in the past few seasons but still believes he has plenty to offer still on the field. In a statement, Pirates confirmed that they couldn’t find an agreement with Jele regarding his next role at the club. “Orlando Pirates Football Club can confirm that Happy Jele met with the Chairman of the Club at the end of the 2021/22 season to discuss his future,” read the statement.  “During these deliberations, which spanned a three-week period, the Club discussed various job options available to the long-term serving defender in a non-playing capacity. “Subsequent to this meeting, the 35-year-old was afforded time to go home and think about it. “Ordinarily, players are released at the end of the players’ contract but in Happy’s case, as he has a special place in the Club, having served the Club so professionally over the past 16 years, the Chairman had specifically asked the player for his input. “A follow-up meeting was held two weeks later where Happy expressed his intensions to continue playing football beyond the 2021/2022 season, an option that unfortunately is not available. “Everyone at Orlando Pirates Football Club would like to express the enormous gratitude to Happy Jele and wish him the very best of luck for the future.”
