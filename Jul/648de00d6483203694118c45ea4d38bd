A NEW government appears to be on the horizon for Nelson Mandela Bay. The official opposition, Democratic Alliance (DA) and smaller parties have signed an agreement to form a new coalition government. On Thursday 28 July, the DA, the African Christian Democratic Party, African Independent Congress, Abantu Integrity Movement, Freedom Front Plus, Pan Africanist Congress and United Democratic Movement (UDM) told journalists they were ready to table a motion of no confidence to unseat the African National Congress (ANC). The coalition has 56 seats and will need the support of the Economic Freedom Fighters and its eight seats to oust the current ANC-led administration. DA leader John Steenhuisen said the political parties had different approaches and philosophies but people couldn’t eat philosophies and ideologies. “The coalition will put differences aside to improve services. People are starving in Nelson Mandela Bay as the ANC does not know what to do to improve their lives,” he said. “The service delivery simply cannot materialise without a strong institution to implement the ideas of political leadership.” ALSO READ | ABAFUNDISI porn shock! Abantu Integrity Movement president Mkhuseli Jack said he was happy that party leaders saw the seriousness of the situation. “Our city is completely lawless and some wanted to use municipal money for their political party campaigns and rallies and we can’t allow that,” he said. Luxolo Namette of the UDM said a fight over the city manager’s position had taken away stability. Retief Ondendaal is tipped to be the next mayor while Jack is expected to be the deputy mayor. The speaker of the council will come from the DA and the council chief whip will be chosen by the Freedom Front Plus.
