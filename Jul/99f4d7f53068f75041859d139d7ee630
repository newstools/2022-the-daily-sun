KAIZER Chiefs and Stellenbosch FC will be chasing  DStv Diski Challenge history when they meet in Diski Shield final tomorrow at Mpumalanga Stadium (1pm). Amakhosi were the first team to win the Shield when it was launched in 2018. The following year they failed to defend it and it was won by Golden Arrows. Now that the Shield has returned following a two-year break due to Covid-19, Chiefs youngsters have put themselves in a position of becoming the first team to win two Diski Shield titles. However, Stellies are also eyeing history. Stellies are the 2021-22 Diski Challenge Champions and by winning the Shield they will join Arrows in being the only two teams to win both the Diski Challenge and Shield. Both coaches Vela Khumalo of Chiefs and Evangelos Vellios of Stellenbosch admitted there is pressure ahead of this match. Khumalo said: “We are looking forward to the final and it’s just more pressure for us. We have seen two games (of Stellenbosch) they are a very well-oiled organised machine but we know where to hurt them and we will guard against them hurting us.” Vellios stated: “The boys showed character in the past two games, but I am expecting more in the final as we have not played our best football so far. There would be a huge crowd supporting them (Chiefs) and that automatically put us under pressure, but we are looking forward to it, these boys have developed a winning mentality.” Earlier at the same venue (11am), Chippa United will face Mamelodi Sundowns in the third place play-off match.
