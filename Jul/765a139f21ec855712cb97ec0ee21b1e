THE road to 2024 looks rocky and ActionSA members will be asking for divine intervention. Party members said they would hold a prayer session in the first week of every month to pray the ANC out of government. PR Councillor Marcia Barron said they believed if they put God first, the land would be healed. “We are here as Christians in the organisation and we believe it’s time God intervened. We believe we have been called into government to help the people. “Our country is in decay. People need help and love. We are here as an example to show love to Mzansi, irrespective of colour or race,” she said. “Our mission is to get the ANC out because it has no interest in looking after the citizens of this country. Our aim is to be a coalition government with opposition parties because we believe ActionSA will be a big party, if not the biggest, due to the fact that we speak to every South African.” Pastor Hannes Cotzee, also a party member, said the country was broken. “Politicians have made empty promises that are not in line with the Constitution. The Bible says, ‘if my people will humble themselves and pray, I will heal the land’. This teaches us that God is our king and can’t be voted out,” he said. However, Tshwane African National Congress chairman Eugene Modise said: “If ActionSA sees something wrong with us, they should pray for us,” he said.
