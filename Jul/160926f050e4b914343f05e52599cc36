MEDIA personality Somizi Mhlongo has responded to Palesa Madisakwane’s claims. This after Palesa revealed on the reality show, Living the Dream with Somizi, that she never knew that Somizi was gay. “In my little girl’s mind I thought I had a boyfriend. He didn’t act gay or seem flamboyant. There was no apparent sign of him being gay,” she said on the show. “What hurts me most is that whenever he does his interviews he’d say I knew he was gay. That’s false. “How would I have known that he was gay? Where would I have learnt about homosexuality? I learnt about homosexuality through him.” But in a recent interview on Kaya 959 with Sol Phenduka and Dineo Ranaka, Somizi said he has always been honest. “I’ve never been straight and Palesa knew. That’s why there was no shock on her side, she knew. I was a child star by then and girls used to throw themselves at me, but I’d tell them that I play for both teams.” ALSO READ : Former Imbewu actress gets married! Asked if he enjoyed making the baby, he responded: “I absolutely enjoyed making the baby.” He further revealed that the last time he was with a woman was five years ago. “It wasn’t a relationship and I enjoyed it. At some point I thought I was gay, but then again I thought I was bi-sexual, but now I think I’m pansexual. “This means I’m attracted to whoever I’m attracted to at that time. I’m not attracted to a specific gender, but it’s the vibes and the chemistry with that person. It could be a guy or a woman or a transgender person but not animals,” he said. Somizi said he does not want to be boxed in. “The more I get older is the more I find myself. I’m exploring and it’s okay. If I’m confusing people it’s fine as long as I’m not confusing the person I’m with at that time,” he said. A post shared by Kaya 959 (@kayaon959)
