WHEN they went to the mountain, they were boys and now they are back as men. Ndebele initiates are back from the mountain for initiation. They left on 27 April and came back on Thursday night, 30 June. They spent a gruelling two months in the bush to be transformed into men. Covid-19 has delayed the culture as it was supposed to be done last year. In February, Ndebele King Makhosoke II announced that the culture will be performed. Ndebele Chief William Ntobela said he sent 42 boys to the bush for initiation and he’s happy they are all back. “It was a challenging time for us as we had to perform our culture in the midst of the pandemic.I thank my ancestors for keeping the boys safe. It was not easy and there were a few challenges but I am happy there were no fatalities. “All I want from the new initiates is to respect elders. They must apply the lessons they have learnt from the bush to lead a good life. Education is very important and they must go back to school. They are men now and they must not be involved in gender-based violence, crime and drugs,” he said. Community leader Elias Sikhosana thanked the parents and everyone involved for making sure the boys were safe. “We have produced future men who will take the culture forward. They have learnt valuable lessons and must conduct themselves well,” he said. An initiate, Matjhila Mtsweni (19), said: “It was not easy and what makes man is facing difficult challenges.I am happy to be back as a man.” Madzela Sikhosana (20) said: “I am going to live by all the lessons I have learnt from the bush.”
