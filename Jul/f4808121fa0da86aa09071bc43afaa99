THE Department of Social Development has proposed to increase the maximum allowable income to qualify for the special Covid-19 social relief of distress grant from R350 to R624. Assessment will be done every month to ensure that the applicant receives income that is below R624 in order to qualify. On Thursday, 14 July, Minister Lindiwe Zulu published draft regulations to amend some of the provisions for the grant for the period 1 March 2022 to 31 March 2023. She said the value of the grant remained R350 per person per month for the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, and the second amendment was seeking to remove the requirement for applicants to indicate if they required the grant after every three months. “In addition, the third amendment is aimed at removing the clause that places the bank verification process as the main criteria for determining eligibility. This is to ensure that Sassa applies different database checks, including bank account income, before approving or declining application,” she said.
