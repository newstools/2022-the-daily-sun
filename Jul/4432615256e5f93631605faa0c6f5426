MZANSI motorists have been faced with hard times over the past few months, and it seems there’s no relief in sight. On Wednesday, motorists will be hit with another huge petrol hike as the petrol levy cut falls from R1,50 a litre to 75c. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy announced on Monday that petrol prices will be hiked by R2,37 (93) and R2,57 (95) a litre, while diesel prices will rise by R2,31 (0,05% sulphur) and R2,30 (0.005% sulphur) a litre. This means that in Gauteng, a litre of 95 petrol will cost R26,74 from Wednesday. This is 54% more than a year ago, when it cost R17,39. ALSO READ: WATCH: The dangers of running a generator indoors! Paraffin prices will increase by R1,66 a litre, while the maximum LPGas retail price will fall by R2,18/kg. In April, government cut the petrol levy by R1,50 a litre in an effort to relieve the economic stress of surging fuel prices. Fin24 reports that from Wednesday, the levy will lowered to only 75c - and the full levy will take effect from next month. The levy relief is costing government billions. Local fuel prices are determined by international oil prices, as well as the dollar-rand value, as South Africa buys oil in dollars.
