AN off-duty traffic officer was shot and killed
at Saselani Trust near Bushbuckridge on Friday 12 July. According to the police, the 35-year-old traffic
officer was driving his gold VW Polo hatchback with his two friends when two
armed suspects abruptly emerged alongside the road, wielding a firearm. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said,
“The registration number plate of the vehicle is HLL 305 MP. The suspects then
ordered the driver (traffic officer) to stop but when he did not, they fired
shots at the vehicle injuring him. As a result, he subsequently stopped the
vehicle whereby the suspects rounded them up and allegedly dragged the injured
driver as well as his two friends out of the car.” Mohlala said the suspects are said to have then
driven away with the victim's car. “It is further reported that the victims were
assisted by other motorists who took them to Mapulaneng Hospital where the
injured traffic officer, unfortunately, died on arrival. He has since been
identified by his family as Thabo Mashego.” Mohlala said the police at Bushbuckridge opened
a case of hijacking with an additional charge of murder and a manhunt was
launched for the suspects. READ: Hijacked cop found dead, eight bust! The Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS in
