SOUTH African National Parks (SANParks) has expressed sympathy for a worker from the Shalati Concession in Mpumalanga who was attacked by a leopard on his way to work on Sunday morning, 17 July. SANParks spokesman, Ike Phaahla, said after the worker fought off the leopard and shouted for help, the animal disappeared into the bushes. “The injured worker was rushed to the doctor for treatment. He suffered deep lacerations and trauma, but the injuries are understood not to be life threatening. “An operation was immediately launched by the Rangers Corps and the airwing to search the vicinity for the animal,” said Phaahla. “It was spotted 30m away from where the incident took place and was duly destroyed. “This is the second incident where a worker has been attacked by a leopard in the recent past in the Kruger National Park.” The first incident happened on 26 June when a leopard attacked a worker. Head ranger, Cathy Dreyer, said: “Since the first incident, every effort has been made to try and capture the leopard but without success. “Given the location of the incident, we suspect that the destroyed leopard is the same animal responsible for the first attack.” She added: “Residents and employees must be extra vigilant and avoid walking alone at all times.” Dreyer said the leopard has been delivered to the state vets for a postmortem. Jerry Mabena, the CEO of Motsamayi Tourism Group, who are the owners of Kruger Shalati and Kruger Station, said: “We were shocked by this tragic incident. We are very relieved that our colleague survived this ordeal. “We thank the medical support staff who acted quickly, and SANParks for their support in the incident.”
