THE grieving families of MacDuff Mashabane (33) and Success Mashele (34), whose bodies were found dumped in the bushes near the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga, have slammed the police for failing them. This comes after two suspects aged 18 and 33, who were arrested in connection with their murder, were released from police custody on Monday, 18 July. The Mashele and Mashabane families, who will be burying their loved ones on Saturday, 23 July, walked out of the court disappointed. “We are really shattered and disappointed with the Bushbuckridge police. “They told us both suspects were not linked to our sons’ murders and as such, the matter could not be heard in court,” said Success’ uncle Jessa Mashele. MacDuff’s father, Delane Mashabane, said: “We are extremely disappointed. This case should be handled by special investigators, not police officers from this station. We’ve lost trust in them.” The families said Success and MacDuff were allegedly kidnapped and thrown into a double cab bakkie in broad daylight, allegedly by a businesswoman and her gang. They were accused of stealing stock from the woman’s spaza on Monday, 11 July. That was the last time the two men were seen alive. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said: “The case was taken to the senior public prosecutor for further investigation and instructions.”
