CAPE Town City Spurs FC have announced the arrival of Congolese striker Osaka Ngelada Modeste. Modeste joins the GladAfrica Championship side from CRD Libolo and he will be with the club until the remainder of the season. The club took to Twitter on Monday to announce the arrival of Modeste and stated that he joins the team to add extra strength to their attacking line. “We are pleased to announce our new signing, Osako Ngeleda Modeste. The 27-year-old Congolese striker joins us to add extra strength to our attacking line. We look forward to Modeste’s future endeavors with us over the remainder of the season,” the club’s tweet reads. Shaun Bartlett's team has been lacking in front of goals this season and will hope to see Modeste help the team in front of goals to get their promotion hopes up and survive relegation. They have only managed to score 16 goals in 17 games this season and they’re on position 11 with 12 points behind log leaders Richards Bay. Bartlett will be hoping to see an immediate impact from the new signing to help improve their campaign which has seen them winning only four games in 17 games.
