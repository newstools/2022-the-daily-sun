MORE than 67 families removed from Holfontein Farm in Greylingstad, Mpumalanga, have accused the land claims commissioner of dragging his feet in finalising their claims. Spokesman Sozabili Mpila told Daily Sun they made a successful land claim for Holfontein Farm between 1998 and 2015. “In 2019, officials from the regional land claims commissioner’s office told us our claim was successful. They collected our banking details. “But nothing came forth. “Our ancestors lived on the land in the 60s before their 67 families were dispossessed in 1996. Today, the commissioner’s office is playing another tune. We are dragged from pillar to post,” he said. Regional land claims commissioner deputy director Zithini Dlamini confirmed the claim was lodged with the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights in 2015. “The claim was lodged in terms of the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, which reopened the lodgement of claims for five years. The validity of the amendment act was challenged in the Constitutional Court, which found it invalid. The commission is no longer allowed to accept new claims. “The Constitutional Court interdicted the commission from processing claims until it finalised the claims lodged by 31 December 1998 or until Parliament passes a new law.”
