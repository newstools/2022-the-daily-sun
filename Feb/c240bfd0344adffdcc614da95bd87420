THE Langa community in Cape Town was left shocked after Sinawo Nono was killed in front of her boyfriend. The 25-year-old was shot in Intersite squatter camp on Monday, 14 February. Her mum Ntombenceba (44) said she was with Sinawo just before she died. “She was with her boyfriend at his shack, and I was there to pick something up,” she said. On her way back, she heard gunshots but never thought it was her daughter being killed. “Her boyfriend arrived, saying my daughter had been shot. I rushed back and saw her lying in a pool of blood.” ALSO READ: NAZO, MAHALA DATA ON THE WAY!
