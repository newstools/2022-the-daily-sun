Parliament arson-accused Zandile Christmas Mafe was denied bail on
Friday, 04 February. Mafe was arrested on 2 January. He has been charged with causing the
devastating fire which gutted the National Assembly building and parts of the
Old Assembly. Mafe had proposed that, if granted bail, he should either stay with
family in Mahikeng, or at his shack in Site B, Khayelitsha. He also faces a charge under the Terrorism Act. Magistrate Michelle Adams found that Mafe had not shown exceptional
circumstances warranting bail. SOURCE: NEWS24
