MZANSI’S biggest reality competition, Big Brother Mzansi, had its first eviction yesterday, Sunday 6 February. Housemates Mvelo Ntuli and Dinky were the first to leave the show. Mvelo, who’s appeared in several productions, has a famous sister, Sibu Jili who plays Georgina on The Queen. Sibu told Daily Sun although her brother’s time on the show was short-lived, she’s proud of him and hoped he used this opportunity as a stepping stone to grow his career. “He took a very big step to boost his media presence, a conservative young man with a big heart,” she said. “I was hoping he gets what he needs from the show to understand himself within the industry, that extra R2 million would have definitely looked good in our accounts of course, but not all wins come in the form of money.” ALSO READ : SINGER BUYS HIS DRIVER A CAR! With viewers, Mvelo was not their favourite and from the start they wanted him gone. But Sibu said he was brave and she’d like to applaud him for taking the step to go to the Big Brother House to compete with strangers. The bubbly 28-year-old Mvelo from KZN told host Lawrence Maleka it was a bittersweet moment for him, but it was the nature of the game. When asked which housemates he’d miss, Mvelo said no one. With the 17 people left to fight it out for the R2-million grand prize, there’s promise of plenty more drama. Big Brother Mzansi Season 3 is broadcast live 24/7 on DStv Channel 198, including a daily highlights show on Mzansi Magic (DStv channel 161) at 10.30pm, Tuesdays to Fridays.
