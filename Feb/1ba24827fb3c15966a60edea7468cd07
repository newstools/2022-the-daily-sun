IN most countries, swearing in public is deemed offensive and illegal. A woman was recently sentenced to 10 weeks in jail for shouting and swearing at members of the public in Bury St Edmunds, England. According to East Anglian Daily Times, the woman was arrested after she randomly swore at people who were passing by her house. It is reported that the 52-year-old was previously jailed for eight weeks last October, after pleading guilty to harassing neighbours by posting unwanted items through their letterboxes. To curb the use of profanity language on the streets, Australians risk copping fines of up to $21,720 (about R320 000) or a six-month prison term if caught swearing in public. Daily Mail reports that in Australia, people enjoyed the freedom of swearing in their homes while facing heavy fines and jail time if they did so in public spaces. “Anyone caught can be fined up to $660 (about R10 000). They might even be required to complete up to 100 hours of community service if they swear near a school,” the article read.
