THE moment of truth has finally arrived for Banyana Banyana. Desiree Ellis’ charges host Algeria in the first leg of their Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Awcon) qualifier at Orlando Stadium on Friday afternoon (3pm). Banyana players know the importance of winning this qualifier as it holds key to the Awcon finals and Fifa Women's World Cup ticket. After Friday's game, Banyana will travel on Saturday to Algeria for the second leg clash scheduled for next Wednesday in Algiers. The winner will qualify for the Awcon finals in Morocco from 2-23 July. Banyana goalkeeper Andile Dlamini has made a solemn promise to the country ahead of this match. Dlamini said: “We have been working extremely hard because we know what is at stake. We are promising to do our best and make the country proud. We are ready mentally and the energy at training is positive. “We have seen how Algeria play, we will just make sure we apply everything the coach told us and get the win.” Ellis said they aim to win without conceding a goal so that they are in a favourable position for the away leg. Ellis said: "We have to make sure we execute our plans and keep a clean sheet." Banyana will not take Algeria lightly in order to avoid what they suffered in 2019 when they lost to Botswana and failed to qualify for Olympic Games. “The men's Afcon (which recently came to an end in Cameroon) has shown us that you underestimate a team at your peril and Algeria's football has shown they have a huge pedigree, so we can't take them lightly," Ellis added. Qualifying for Awcon will keep Banyana's World Cup hopes alive as they will need to finish within the top four in Morocco to qualify for 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup.
