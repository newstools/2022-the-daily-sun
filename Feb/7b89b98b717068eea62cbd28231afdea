THE Bible says: “Honour your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land.” But this was not the case for Siya Tshem, who allegedly bludgeoned his mum Nozipho (72) to death in Kariega, Eastern Cape, on Monday 21 February. In a strange twist of events, the 26-year-old was then killed by a car while fleeing the scene. Police spokeswoman, Colonel Priscilla Naidu said Nozipho was sleeping in her late daughter’s living room when her son entered at around 2am. “It is alleged there was a commotion between the two and Nozipho was repeatedly struck with a hammer on the head. She died at the scene,” she said. Naidu said while police were attending to the scene, a culpable homicide case was reported nearby. It turned out that a VW Polo driver hit Siya at around 4am. Both Siya and his mum lived in Cape Town but were in the Eastern Cape to attend her daughter’s funeral.
