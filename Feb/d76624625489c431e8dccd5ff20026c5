DJ AND producer TNS has dropped his first single of the year titled Sikelela. The song, featuring rising producer Kasango and vocalist Bukeka, is dedicated to mums and children. He spoke to SunBuzz about the single. “The song is a prayer for mums and children to live and be well as we are starting the year. They are very special people, and we must put them first, hence the song. We also want to push for people to respect them and for God to bless them because they deserve all the good things in life. The song is available on all digital streaming platforms,” said TNS, whose real name’s Nkazimulo Ngema. He said he felt Kasango and Bukeka are special, that’s why he featured them in the song. “I heard Kasango’s work on Zakes Bantwini’s song Osama and I loved his sound. He’s a dope producer. I also like the previous songs before the one he did with Zakes. Another thing I liked is that he’s a new producer and I am happy to be part of his success,” he said.

I searched for her on social media until I found her. She gave me goosebumps the first time I heard her voice. I had to work with her.” He is working on two big projects. “Firstly, I am working on an EP that’s definitely coming this year. I can’t share much for now, but the EP will be heavy, and it has five tracks only,” said the musician. “Then, I’ll be hosting a concert in Mandeni, KZN, where I was born. The people from there support me. They’ve been there for me, but I’ve never had the chance to speak to them, visit them and thank them. Well, it is finally happening this year in July,” he said.
