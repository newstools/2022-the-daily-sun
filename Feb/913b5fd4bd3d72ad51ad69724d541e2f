AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has lashed out at his management for failure to sign credible goals-corers that he requested. Benni has attributed their goalless draw against TS Galaxy, their 13th of the season, as a result of his bosses’ failure to secure players of note in the DStv Premiership. Usuthu have scored a mere goal this year through Luvuyo Memela when they beat Guinea side Horoya AC 1-0 in the Caf Champions League last Friday. Although, he retained three strikers in Memela, Augustine Mulenga and Abraham Majok against Galaxy, they were blunt in front of goal. The Bafana Bafana all time scorer is worried where he would get goals when they host Algerian side ES Setif at King Zwelithini Stadium tomorrow (6pm). “It’s a massive concern and that was my biggest cry when I came for the new season,” said Benni on SuperSportTV. “That was the area I wanted to strengthen, where I had identified players I wanted. That was the area of my main concern because I knew last season we didn’t do amazing as a group, we did great individually. “For you to win the Champions League you need players who are hungrier. Hence I needed to strengthen that area of the pitch. “This is what you get, 13 draws because you are stuck with what you have and make do.” Benni said he had asked for top finishers as they are most reliable. He added that he was more frustrated because he teaches his strikers how to finish regularly in training. He went on: “All the missed chances, very easy. I became frustrated as a coach, I mean you shouldn’t do one thing in training and completely the opposite in a match. “You hope the players you bring in will make a difference and when that doesn’t happen, I get questioned about the depth in the squad. “We gave away the easiest three points. Majok had twice the header that he missed. I mean wow with the size of that ball and you missed it completely. “We’ll take a point as we didn’t look like we will score even if we play until tomorrow.”
