DURBAN Gen star Nelisiwe Sibiya wishes celebrities could be taught about humbleness. She said she has witnessed how celebrities think they are better than everyone just because they appear on TV. “The only difference between a celebrity, TV actors in particular, and an ordinary person is the TV appearance. So celebrities must stop thinking they are better than anyone just because they are celebrities,” said Nelisiwe. ALSO READ | BET PRESENTER'S BABY JOY! She said she wishes there could be workshops, where celebs could gather and learn about behaviour and how to treat their fans and other people. “We are superstars because of our fans. We grow and blossom because of our fans. We have jobs because of our fans. So we must stop undermining and looking down on them. They’re our cheerleaders. They deserve respect. I wish workshops where celebs would be taught how to treat fans could be organised. Humbleness is very important,” said Nelisiwe.
