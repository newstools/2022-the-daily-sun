We are waiting for the channel on whether they will cancel the show. “I can’t lie, we are on the edge and scared of what might happen next. But what comforts us is that even if it does, when one door closes another one opens. There are other Ferguson shows that are still running and we can possibly join in the near future, but at this moment we are waiting for the channel. It might not be the end just yet,” said the actor. According to Mzansi Magic’s publicist Irvin Pooe, the channel will release an official statement during the course of the week. Produced by the Ferguson Films, The Queen has been on air for six years. It centres around the life of businesswoman Harriet Khoza, who is played by veteran actress Connie Ferguson.
