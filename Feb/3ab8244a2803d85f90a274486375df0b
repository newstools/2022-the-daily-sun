AL AHLY coach Pitso Mosimane has issued a warning to teams playing in the Caf Champions League this season, who intend to wrestle the trophy he has won in the last two seasons. The former Mamelodi Sundowns coach has vowed he will fight to win the main club prize in Africa once again. The group stages of the Champions League kick-off this weekend, but Ahly won’t feature as they will be participating in the third and fourth play-off match in the Fifa Club World Cup against Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia tomorrow (3pm). Ahly, who have won the Caf premier’s club competition in the last two years, are in the group stages with Mosimane’s former club Sundowns, and two Sudanese outfits Al-Hilal and Al Merrikh. Ahly will start the group stages next weekend when they visit Al-Hilal. “We will do our best to win the Champions League in order to return to the Club World Cup,” said Mosimane in the Egyptian media. But the South African-born manager was asked to address comparison him and former Ahly coach Manuel José, stating that “it’s too early as he has spent far less time at Al Ahly”. Added Mosimane: “Manuel José is a great coach. He did a lot for Al Ahly. “He stayed here for seven years while I came here only 15 months ago. If I stay here for seven years, then I can be compared to him.” Jose from Portugal is Al-Ahly’s most successful coach for Ahly, having won the Egyptian Premier League six times, Egypt Cup twice, Egyptian Super Cup four times, Champions League four times and Caf Super Cup four times. He helped Ahly to claim the third spot in the Club World Cup in 2006.
