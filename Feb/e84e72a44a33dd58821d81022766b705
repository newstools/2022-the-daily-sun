Kuli Roberts’ life was celebrated in style and with music at her memorial service held at Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, on Wednesday, 16 February. Musicians including Siphokazi, Aus Tebza and Ringo Madlingozi sang while the programme was directed by Kuli’s former Trending SA co-hosts Shaka Sisulu and Nina Hastie. Former colleague at Kaya FM Skhumba Hlophe said: “Kuli spoke her mind and one thing I learnt about her was that every day she was writing a page in her own book. The page was full of love, laughter and craziness.” Among the mourners were UDM leader Bantu Holomisa, Dr Bishop Jessica Mbangeni, Tumi Masemola, Zola Hashatsi, Nambitha Ben-Mazwi, Penny Lebyane and DJ Sbu. Kuli died on Wednesday, 9 February at the age of 49 after complaining of shortness of breath.  ALSO READ: WHOO SHEM! SOMGAGA - BEKU ROUGH Actress and model Refilwe Modiselle spoke about Kuli’s activism for people living with albinism. “The relationship goes as far back as when I was 19 years old. We were out and about when she called me and asked me if I knew how gorgeous I was. From then, she adopted me as her child. I was like her long-lost child,” she said.  Kuli’s sister and actress Hlubi Mboya spoke on behalf of the family. “She was complex, beautiful, difficult, loving, kind, crazy and fantastic but she was so gentle. Let’s just let her go because she needs to rest,” she said. Kuli’s children, Tembela and Leaun, wrote a letter to their mum. “We miss you, mummy. We miss you, sister. We miss your love, laughs, jokes, humour and hugs,” they wrote. Kuli’s funeral was planned for Thursday 17 February and would be a private ceremony.
