Western
Cape authorities have dished out 7 043 traffic fines worth around R7 million,
from 31 January to 6 February. Over the
past week, authorities held 292 integrated roadblocks, vehicle checkpoints and
speed control operations across the province, stopping and checking 5 219
vehicles. Of these,
34 vehicles were impounded and 94 were declared unroadworthy. Western
Cape Transport and Public Works MEC Daylin Mitchell said he was concerned about
the number of drivers who speed. "Speeding
is a serious concern. The faster you drive, the less time you have to respond
to an emergency and the more space you need to stop to avoid a crash. Speeding
is irresponsible and dangerous," he said. The highest
speeds recorded in the past week were: - 178km/h in a 120km/h zone - 144km/h in a 100km/h zone - 109km/h in an 80km/h zone - 105km/h in a 60km/h zone Twenty-seven
crashes occurred in the reporting period, and 34 fatalities were recorded.
Among those who died were nine drivers, 10 passengers, 14 pedestrians and one
motorcyclist. "Certain
road users are more vulnerable than others. Children, people with disabilities
and older people are more vulnerable than younger, able-bodied pedestrians.
Cyclists and motorcyclists are more vulnerable than people in vehicles,"
Mitchell added. Meanwhile,
a total of 62 arrests were made and 39 of them were for driving under the
influence of alcohol. Eleven
people were also arrested for possession of fraudulent documentation and three
people were arrested for trying to bribe officers. "When
you are driving, be patient and understanding. Remember that wheelchair users
are closer to the ground than most people, they are less mobile than
able-bodied people. The road belongs to everybody, be especially careful around
vulnerable road users," Mitchell said. SOURCE:
