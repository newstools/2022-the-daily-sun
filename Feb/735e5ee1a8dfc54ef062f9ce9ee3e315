 An Eastern Cape man stunned beer lovers by creating a new, uniquely South African beer, made from traditional African umqombothi and craft beer. William Yell, owner of Featherstone Brewery and Entrepid Brewing in Makhanda, said his idea was to develop a product that was "as South African as possible". Yell showcased his new beer, Ibhiya, on Saturday at Makhanda's Craft Beer Crawl, an annual event organised by his brewery in partnership with Makana Tourism.   "Sour beers had also been gaining in popularity in the craft industry, so my idea was to merge these two concepts and create something local by a fusion of modern beer brewing and traditional methods." Yell said Ibhiya is the perfect choice for those wanting to explore different craft beer flavours, which are slightly sour, but steeped in tradition.  Fermentation, though, is a bit faster than normal because the alcohol content is lower than standard beers – about 3.5%. It takes 21 days for the beer to be ready for drinking.   It is one of the stops on the province's Craft Brewing, Distilling and Wine Route, which offers tourists a chance to experience various local breweries and distilleries. The Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency launched the project in partnership with the Liquor Board. Makana Tourism's acting director, Prudence Mini, said a limited edition of iBhiya was available at Olde 65, on 65 New Street, in Makhanda. Mini said the Saturday craft beer tour was "a kickstart to many other events on the Makana calendar that will help our visitors and locals alike to explore the area through unique experiences".
