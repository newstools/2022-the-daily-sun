BUSINESSMAN Hlaudi Motsoeneng recently went to MacGyver “MacG” Mukwevho’s popular platform Podcast and Chill with MacG, where he opened up about how he ended up where he’s today. The controversial businessman, who made headlines for all the wrong reasons while the acting COO at SABC, shared that he was once homeless. “I used to stay alone and at school, I was part of the drama team. When the teacher left, I took over as the writer and producer. Then I negotiated with my principal and told him that he knew I was struggling. I asked him if we could share the cake as I had taken over from the previous teacher,” he said. He shared that being homeless was not by choice, and he was taken off by the community. “I was living with my cousin, who drank and smoked all the time, so I left,” he said. The former TV boss also said he first saw his mother for the first time after appearing on TV. Hlaudi spoke about how he ended up at the SABC, saying he was invited to an audition and came out at the top. He then started presenting Top Sport while doing grade 10.

I had to choose between being at school and bread – and I chose bread,” he said. Although he never completed his matric, Hlaudi also shared that he was not against people getting educated, but his issue was with the kind of education offered in Mzansi. “I think we need to allow our education system to be flexible. Children must be taught skills and expertise because if you have them, you won’t struggle for work."
