NTUTHUKO Shoba’s defence Advocate Norman Makhubela has questioned the conduct of investigating officers in the murder case. He cross-examined Sergeant Mpe Teme in theGauteng High Court in Joburg on Thursday, 3 February. Teme said after he took a statement from Shoba following the murder of his heavily-pregnant girlfriend Tshegofatso Pule, he told him he was going to stay with his parents but he did not give him their address. Makhubela asked Teme why he didn’t take the address and he replied that he was confident he would be able to reach Shoba through his brother. Makhubela asked Teme why Shoba was not arrested after Pule’s killer, Muzikayise Malephane, he said he had been acting on behalf of Shoba. Teme said although the police had Malephane’s statement and a suspicious phone, there was not enough evidence to arrest Shoba. The matter will resume on Tuesday, 8 February.
