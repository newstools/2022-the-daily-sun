COPS in Gauteng have launched a manhunt following a murder of a bystander during a cross pavement robbery outside a business outlet in Eden Park on Sunday, 20 February. According to Colonel Athlenda Mathe, just after 12.30pm, a group of armed men accosted security officials of a cash solution company as they collected money from the business outlet. “Reports from the scene indicate that during the incident, the armed men started randomly shooting toward the cash van before they fled the scene on foot with at least three money bags. “Sadly, one innocent bystander, a 38-year-old man, was shot and killed. He was certified dead by medical emergency personnel at the scene,” Mathe said. She said other cars in the vicinity of the business outlet were also shot at and damaged as a result of the shooting. Mathe said resources had been mobilised in a bid to apprehend those responsible for the armed robbery and murder of the innocent bystander. “Anyone with information about this crime should contact the Eden Park Police Station or the Crime Stop Hotline number on 08600 10111. Police have since embarked on the process to locate the family of the innocent bystander. His name will be released once his next of kin have all been informed,” she said.
