TWO suspects are expected to appear in the Booysens Magistrates Court for fraud and corruption. Authorities acted on intelligence at the City of Joburg’s Group Forensic and Investigation Services (GFIS) regarding suspicious fraudulent activities at the Ormonde Licensing Department, south of Joburg. Gauteng Hawks spokesman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said it was alleged that the suspects fraudulently registered driver’s licences for clients without being examined by authorities for a bribe of R4 500. “The matter was reported to the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation in Johannesburg for further investigation. Then a sting operation was conducted on Wednesday, 2 February by the Hawks and GFIS at the said office where two suspects, a female cleaner and male examiner were apprehended,” said Mulamu. She said during the operation, cops seized the R4 500 bribe money, fraudulent driver’s licences and electronic gadgets for further investigation.
