“KISSING is like drinking salted water. You drink, and your thirst increases.” This Chinese proverb beautifully explains this experience that, when done correctly, becomes a never-quenching exercise that will leave you wanting more. In order for that to occur, one needs to master the art of kissing. According to marriage.com, studies show that kissing and other forms of physical affection trigger the release of the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding in couples. This bonding agent acts as a glue that strengthens your relationship and keeps you both feeling satisfied. So, how would you know that you’re a good kisser? According to Insider magazine, these are some of the signs to indicate that: 1. You Receive Great Feedback The best endorsement of your style will be word of mouth, specifically from someone you just kissed. If someone, unprompted, feels the need to compliment you on a kiss, then you’re probably good at it. 2. You Do It Often They say practice makes perfect – and if one does something regularly, they end up mastering the craft. The same applies for kissing. If you really are a talented kisser, people will be coming back for more. 3. You Kiss For a Long Time If your marathon make-outs go for hours, chances are ...you’re a good kisser. The good news is that people who get more into kisses are scientifically proven to be better kissers. 4. You Are Always Confident Good kissers know that they’re good, so they aren’t afraid to sweep their partners off their feet. Having confidence means you don’t make things awkward when going in for a kiss. 5. You’re Not Afraid To Use Your Hands Being good at getting your hands involved while kissing is like being able to walk and chew gum at the same time. While this may sound easy, one wrong move can trip you up. Using your hands shows you are confident and skilled enough to focus on something other than just kissing.
