A resident said everyone ran for their lives as soon as they heard gunshots. “I had just arrived when I heard gunshots. People started running and I joined because we didn’t know who was shooting.” Some were already in the taxis, but they ran as soon as they heard gunshots, leaving their belongings behind. “People ran and that was very dangerous because we could’ve got hurt in the process, but we all panicked and decided to run.” A 45-year-old resident said they needed to march to the police station to demand one police van to be stationed at Langa rank. “It is not the first time that something like this happens, and it will continue until there is a police van there. Then, I think those who are killing each other would stop.” Another resident said kids were traumatised. “Some kids didn’t go to school. They were so traumatised because the shooting happened in front of them. We cannot continue like this.”
