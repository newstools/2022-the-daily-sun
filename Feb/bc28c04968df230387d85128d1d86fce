THE returning Simon Harmer is under no illusions about his role in the Proteas setup for the tour of New Zealand. Harmer, who has been away from the South African team for almost seven years, has made his return to the team. The 32-year-old off spinner was one of the players who signed Kolpak deals and pretty much put their Proteas careers behind them. But thanks to Brexit, Harmer, Duanne Olivier, Wayne Parnell and many more are now eligible to represent their country. And Harmer is looking forward to gearing up for the Proteas for the first time since November 2015 ahead of the first Test at Hagley Oval. Harmer, though, is realistic about his chances as he realises that he will most likely be back up to number one spinner Keshav Maharaj for the two Tests. “This opportunity has arisen because things have happened, but that’s how sport works,” Harmer said. “I’m under no illusion as to why I’m here and how I got the opportunity. But I am here now. I’ve got to try and show people what I’m about, what my brand is about. “It’s been a long time since I was involved in the setup and I think I’ve matured a lot. I understand what I need to do and how I need to go about it.” The fact that the two matches will be played in green bouncing wickets means the Proteas are more likely to play only one spinner, Maharaj. But Harmer insists he will be ready to play a big part should the need for his inclusion arise for one reason or another. “Hagley Oval is probably the greenest, quickest, bounciest wicket in New Zealand. So the chances of us playing two spinners are very low,” admitted Harmer. “Kesh (Maharaj) has done extremely well in his international career so far. I’m always going to be a supporting act to him. For this tour, it’s about working hard and supporting the guys who will be playing, and adding value where I can – music in the changeroom, throwing balls, pushing guys to be better.”
