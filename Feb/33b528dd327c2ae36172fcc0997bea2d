TS Galaxy coach Sead Ramovic has left Mzansi football supporters shocked. This after he decided to flaunt his ability to speak IsiZulu on national TV. In a pre-match conference on SuperSport TV ahead of their Nedbank Cup match against Kaizer Chiefs, Ramovic shocked a lot of fans when he uttered a few words in IsiZulu. The German tactician has been in Mzansi for a handful of months, but he seems to be learning a lot. “Sanibonani to all of you. Before I start I would like to say “sizokwena konke okusemandleni namuhla,” Ramovic said. His side eventually walked away 1-0 winners on the day, dumping Amakhosi out of the Nedbank Cup.
