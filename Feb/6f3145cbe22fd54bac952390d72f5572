THEY gathered to help a grieving family lay their loved ones to rest but ended up being attacked by a swarm of bees. Mourners in Ekangala, near Bronkhorstspruit were attacked by bees at Cullinan Cemetery on Friday, 11 February, leaving four of them in hospital. Witness Nqobile Lukhuleni said there were two funerals taking place when the bees arrived out of nowhere. He said young and old mourners were soon running for their lives. “One woman fell and the bees were all over her. They spared no one,” he said. Another mourner said the graves were left open as people tried to find cover. Tshwane Emergency Services deputy chief Charles Mabaso said a truck was sent to the scene. They found a funeral parlour worker hiding in a car and four people had to be taken to hospital. Mabaso said they called professionals to the scene to remove the bees. “Firefighters brought tyres they were going to burn to create smoke to chase the bees away but a bee handler advised them not to. They were told to leave the bees alone for a couple of hours so they could calm down. Our advice to communities is not to poke bee hives because it will agitate the bees. If they find themselves being attacked by bees, they should quickly find cover to avoid being stung and call for help,” he said.
