Antonio Conte could leave Tottenham Hotspur this week. His sensational remarks gave a clear indication that he might be on his out of the club following a disastrous spell. In effect, he hinted at quitting Tottenham just four months into the job, according to TheSun report in the UK. The tabloid reports that the Spurs boss labelled Wednesday night's 1-0 loss to Burnley a 'disaster'. Tottenham's fourth defeat in five matches followed Saturday's incredible last-gasp 3-2 victory at title chasing Manchester City. And Conte cut a dejected figure on the sidelines at Turf Moor before saying: "I have to talk to the club. "Maybe I'm not so good. Tottenham called me to change things - but I'm too honest. "We are doing everything to change situation but it's not enough."
