MUSICIAN David Sejake said it feels great to be singing gospel music. David, also known as The King, said this gave him the platform to minister in song. “God planted this ministry a long time ago but due to financial implications, I had to wait for the perfect time. “Now that I have unleashed what I have been wishing for, it has brought healing to my heart,” he said. He said people had received his songs well. “People are excited and testifying to how my music brings them hope, heals many wounds, mends broken hearts and unites families. And, I have covered all generations in my albums.” The songwriter and producer, born in Joburg, said he was inspired by singers including Todd Dulaney and Ayanda Ntanzi.
