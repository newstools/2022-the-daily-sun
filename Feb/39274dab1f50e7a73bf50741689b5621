GOGO Maria Gololo says a Bible verse about respecting the elders has kept her alive. “If I were to advise young people I would share with them the scripture that says: ‘Respect your mother and father so that you can live long on earth’,” she said. The gogo celebrated her 104th birthday on Saturday, 12 February. She said the motto was given to her by her elders and from an early age she ran with it throughout her life and passed it on to her children. She can still see and is able to hear. The gogo struggles to walk but with a little help she can walk from her bedroom to the TV room. She said she preferred to sit on the floor as she got tired when she sat in a chair. The gogo still loves meat even though she doesn’t have teeth and said her meals must be well-cooked. “I have also taught my children to spread love all the time, not only among themselves but to all human beings. I am grateful and feel blessed that I have lived this long,” said gogo. Her first-born daughter Suzanne Mothata (81) said it feels so good to be a pensioner and still have a mother. “We share so much and I still consult her whenever I am faced with challenges. She continues to play her role as a mother and we feel blessed about that,” she said Gogo Maria’s last born daughter, Malebo Gololo (71), said she is happy she has now retired and can take care of her mother. “She must live peacefully. My mother has taught us a lot and above all she has taught us to love,” she said. Grandchild Kopano Gololo (36) said he grew up under the guidance of gogo and that he would cherish every moment he spent with her. The gogo has three children, nine grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, three great-great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-great grandchildren.
