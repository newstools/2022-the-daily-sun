PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa is all talk and no bite as he is now ditching his ideas of job creation and leaving it to the private sector, say MPs tearing into the Sona speech. DA leader John Steenhuisen credited his party for creating an environment for the private sector to create jobs, but EFF leader Julius Malema warned the private sector could not be trusted. He said this was like sending a cow to the slaughterhouse. “You are the worst president ever. And you are the worst ever to black people, getting poorer under your leadership. More than 1,7 million people previously employed are losing jobs and the majority, if not all of these jobs, were lost in the private sector,” he said.

Malema also accused Ramaphosa of appointing his friends in cabinet and now was sending lap dogs to propose a motion of no confidence against cabinet, in response to Steenhuisen’s saying he served a motion of no confidence against his ministers and not Ramaphosa. Steenhuisen said it was clear the president would rather be seen as weak than splitting the ANC and therefore, they’d do the dirty work of firing his cabinet. He claimed Ramaphosa adopted DA plans on the economy but Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele dismissed this, saying the opposition’s delivery was determined by race. IFP MP Narend Singh said Ramaphosa’s job was simply to communicate what was happening and what government was doing about it. He said Ramaphosa failed dismally during the July unrest. Freedom Front Plus’ Pieter Groenewald said in 2018 Ramaphosa pledged to create jobs and now left that to the private sector.
