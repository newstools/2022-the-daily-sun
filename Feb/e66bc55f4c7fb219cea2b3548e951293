HIGHLY confident University of Pretoria head coach, Tlisani Motaung, believes his team have got what it takes to shatter Chippa United’s hopes of another excellent Nedbank Cup campaign when they host the Chilli Boys in the last-32 at Tuks Stadium on Friday (3pm). Motaung said he’s aware that last season’s Ke Yona Cup runners-up will be looking to make it back-to-back finals, but not under his watch. “I’m sure they are looking to repeat what they did last season and do even better by winning, but they will have an obstacle which is AmaTuks, who have the goal of reaching the round of 16,” he said. Motaung admitted that Chippa are serious opponents for his GladAfrica Championship side at this stage of the competition, considering that they play in the DStv Premiership. But his players are looking forward to the match which they see as an opportunity to showcase their skills with thousands of fans watching on TV at home. “When you look at our Championship matches, they’re not broadcast often, and now playing this match with fans watching on TV is a plus for the players,” he said. AmaTuks qualified for the round of 32 for the first time in six years, and Motaung hopes to see the team reach the later stages. “It’s exciting for me and the club looking at the history of AmaTuks in this competition. We are looking forward to this match. In my view, every match is a priority, and we are looking to go as far as we can,” Motaung said. “If we can reach the final, that will be a great achievement for the club to repeat what happened in 2009.” AmaTuks, while also playing in the old National First Division, were runners up in 2009 where they were edged 1-0 by Moroka Swallows in the final. Motaung added that the Nedbank Cup is a priority just like any other match in the Championship, and he plans on winning every match.
