THEY thought it was a done deal and had gotten away with the crime, but little did they know the police were on their tracks. These are 10 suspects who were arrested in Westonaria, West Rand, after hitting a cash van on Friday, 11 February. The suspects included a woman as well as members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and SAPS. The SANDF member, said to be stationed at Lenasia, was out on bail for a previous CIT in Wedela. The cop is stationed at Carltonville.  Speaking to Daily Sun, Sedibeng District commissioner Major General Fred Kekana said police got a report that a cash van was bombed and money taken by suspects. “Police were also given a description of the getaway cars. Detectives came out in pursuit of the suspects,” said Kekana, adding that further information led them to a safe house where the suspects were hiding.  “In the house, we found the getaway car, Audi A3 with an undisclosed amount of money, bags of dagga and explosives. They also found four suspects. Six others were intercepted while on the run.”  Kekana said other suspects were arrested in Krugersdorp, where more money was found in their car.
