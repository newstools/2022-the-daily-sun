CAF Champions League holders Al Ahly are determined to make the most of their home ground advantage when they host Mamelodi Sundowns in their Group A clash at Cairo International Stadium on Saturday (9pm). Al Ahly now coached by former Downs mentor Pitso Mosimane have appealed to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and the Egyptian government to allow supporters back for this mouth watering clash with the Tshwane giants. If they get their passionate fans back it could make Downs hopes of beating Al Ahly in their backyard even more difficult. Al Ahly want fans back to create a raucous atmosphere to unsettle the 2016 champions who won the title when Mosimane was in charge. The home side aim to make home ground advantage count against Sundowns who they have beaten on the Tshwane giants’ recent four visits to Egypt. Downs have failed to score, having conceded seven goals in those four defeats. “We are speaking with Caf and the security authorities to request fan attendance in the Al Ahly and Sundowns match,” said Ahly executive director, Saad Shalaby. Mosimane’s charges kicked off Group A with a goalless draw against Sudan’s Al Hilal in Omdurman last Friday. Sundowns had a lucky escape, drawing 0-0 with another Sudanese side Al Merrikh the same night in their second group match. Downs match was played in Egypt as Al Merrikh were barred by Caf from playing home matches due to their stadium not fulfilling Caf’s stringent requirements. That resulted in Sundowns staying behind in Egypt to face Ahly, giving them more time to prepare as they search for their first win in the North African country against the 10 times champions.
