MAMELODI Sundowns squandered an opportunity of taking control of their Caf Champions League Group A when they were held to a goalless draw by Al-Merrikh in Cairo on Saturday afternoon. Sundowns controlled most parts of the game and created chances; however, they could not convert in the final third. The result sees them topping the group with four points after two matches. With their performance and chances created on the day, Sundowns should have won the match in the first half, but players that included Khuliso Mudau and Peter Shalulile failed to convert their chances. Towards the end of the first half, Sundowns lost their new signing Erwin Saavedra who had to be substituted due to an injury. They went to the break tied on 0-0, with none of them finding the back of the net. In the second stanza, Al Merrikh showed improvement and forced Sundowns onto the back foot. The Sudanese team then had the ball in the back of the net just after the hour mark through quality first touch and finish from Algazoli, but his chance was ruled offside. Towards the end of the match, the hosts put Sundowns under immense pressure, but Downs were able to contain it and did not concede in the game. The two teams will return to Champions League action next weekend, with Merrikh hosting Sudanese Al Hilal on Friday, while Sundowns are away at Al Ahly on Saturday.
