THE mums of two cousins who were killed by their uncle say residents should not have killed him. They said they wanted his life spared so he could tell them why he took their children’s lives. Nelly Nyundo (26), whose son Onkarabile (4) was killed by her brother, said the family was still in shock after losing three members on Thursday, 17 February. Onkarabile and his cousin Promise (6) went missing on Wednesday from Extension 1 in Mothotlung, North West. On the day, the two were playing outside their gate when their uncle, Simon (33) took them to buy sweets. “My brother didn’t come home that night with the children. We were concerned and called the community to help us look for them. We searched the whole night, but didn’t find them,” she said. Nelly said they continued with the search the next day. “My brother was found and confessed. The community beat him without even saying anything. I even told them to bring my brother so we could question him on why he killed our children.”   Nelly said before her brother was able to say what happened, the community burnt him. “My sister Gloria (30) tried to talk to the community to stop the fire so we could bury the remains. I wanted him arrested so he could tell us why he killed our children and if there were other suspects.” Nelly said she forgave her brother, even though he killed her son. She said even though he was addicted to nyaope, he loved the kids and bought them sweets and toys. “The children’s throats were slit, but there was no blood on the scene. We suspect they were killed somewhere else and dumped in the area,” she said. The kids’ gogo, Doreen, (64) said they didn’t deserve to die like that. Councillor Peter Mokau said he was helping the family with groceries and the burial. North West police spokeswoman, Colonel Adele Myburgh said three murder cases were opened. All three family members will be buried this Saturday.
