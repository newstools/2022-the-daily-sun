BANYANA Banyana have put one foot in the African Women's Cup of Nations (Awcon) after brushing aside Algeria 2-0 at an empty Orlando Stadium on Friday afternoon. The 2-0 victory masks a first half patchy performance that was disappointing for a team that wants to see themselves qualifying for the 2023 Fifa Women's World Cup. The visitors were the first to get a clear-cut chance after an impressive work by Belkhiter Morgan finding Merrouche Imene, who failed to beat Andile Dlamini in the sixth minute. Hilda Magaia put Banyana in the lead as she converted a well-delivered corner kick by Kholisa Biyana to beat Algeria goalkeeper Chloe N'Gazi. They went to the break on the lead. In the secnd half, Banyana disaplayed a much improved perfomance. They created chances but lack of killer instinct was their only downfall. However, Spanish based striker Thembi Kgatlana scored in the 89th minute of the match to give Banyana a comfortable 2-0 lead heading to the second leg. After the match, Coach Desiree Ellis admitted that it was not the best performance and believed they could have scored more goals. Banyana on Saturday will travel to Algeria for the second leg encounter which is scheduled for Wednesday at Omar Hamadi Stadium in Algiers. The winner of the two-legged fixture will qualify for the Awcon to be held in Morocco from 2-23 July. The top four teams in Morocco will automatically qualify for the 2023 Fifa Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
