SOUTH Africa head into their tour of New Zealand “in a good space” and eager to build on their new-found success in Test cricket. This is according to skipper Dean Elgar, who has led the team with distinction in recent months as they produced some good results. Their most recent was an impressive 2-1 win over number one ranked India on home soil last month. They will now hope to pick up where they left off against the Indians when they face New Zealand in Two Tests in Christchurch later this month. “We want to continue building on what we’ve done up to now,” said Elgar. “We are on to something as a group and we want to continue improving. “It’s a two Test series so it’s important we start well. “We’ve let ourselves down with our starts in the past, but we can’t afford that. We are building something great. The guys are in a good space and want to maintain this.” This will be the Proteas’ first trip to Christchurch since 1999, meaning the entire current crop will be heading into the unknown. But Elgar insists the entire team is relishing the challenge and is looking forward to getting stuck in and return with another series victory.
