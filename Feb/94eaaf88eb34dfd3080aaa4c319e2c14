MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi has reserved his comments on Ethiopian international Abubeker Nassir. Nassir is believed to have impressed Sundowns management and signed for the club, according to SunSport sources. However, the player who was on the scoresheet in Sundowns’ friendly against Botswana’s Jwaneng Galaxy on Sunday, will be loaned back to Ethiopian Coffee SC. On Wednesday, during the Nedbank Cup launch, Mngqithi only confirmed Erwin Saavedra, and acknowledged that they have registered the Bolivian for the Caf Champions League. "We have signed Saavedra, and we have registered for the Champions League. He is a very good football player by the way," Mngqithi said. "On Nassir, I prefer not to comment." Sundowns will face Sudanese champions Al Hilal on 11 February in their first Group A at home. That encounter will be followed by two away matches at Al Merreikh and a trip to Egypt where they will face Al Ahly for their third match of the competition. Downs’ Sudanese opponents are already in the country. They have their camp in Cape Town and have already played a couple of warming up matches against the Cape Town-based PSL clubs.
