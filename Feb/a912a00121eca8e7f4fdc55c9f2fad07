WHAT does beer and wine have in common? Besides their human alcohol potency, both of their makings involve a great deal of fermentation. We often draw the same comparison between expired foods and alcohol beverages. While we quickly get rid of food that have gone past their shelf-date, we also do the same with alcohol beverages and according to experts, alcohol, especially beer and wine can taste amazing long after their sell-by date. One alcohol expert agrees that unlike our food, alcohol ages instead of expiring. According to Health-line magazine, once the manufacturer bottles the liquor, it stops aging. After opening, it should be consumed within six to eight months for peak taste. With beer for instance, sealed beer is shelf-stable for six to eight months past its use-by date and lasts longer if refrigerated. Generally, beer with an alcohol volume greater than 8% is slightly more shelf-stable than beer with a lower alcohol by volume. Some experts also agree that an aged beer tastes better because of the apparent fermentation taste. Like beer, some wines are aged in casks or barrels for months or years to further intensify their taste. While fine wines may improve with age, cheap wines should be consumed within two years of bottling according to experts. Furthermore, according to https://store.approvedfood.co.uk, alcohol has a best before date rather than a use-by date, meaning it is safe to drink past the date on the container. Neat alcohol lasts and tastes amazing indefinitely, so it all comes down to how the alcohol has been produced and what else is in the drink that can affect the taste and quality of the product over time. According to the publication, spirits quality taste can last for decades, champagne for over four years, fine wine for decades and beer for over five years.
