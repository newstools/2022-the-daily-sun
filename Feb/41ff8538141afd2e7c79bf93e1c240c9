RADIO presenter Mantsoe Pout has announced that she is leaving Joburg community radio station, Star FM. She has been hosting the lunchtime show, Star Lunch With Mantsoe Pout, from last year. She joined the station four months after leaving 94.7 as DJ Fresh’s co-host on the drive time show. Making the announcement on social media, Manstoe said her time at the station was short, but effective. “This is my last week at Star FM. It’s been great (and short - but effective). Cheers,” she said. Her fans bid her farewell on her post and said they will miss her. ALSO READ: NEW FACE ON DURBAN GEN Twitter user Sandile Ntuli commented: “I’m going to miss you so much, Mantsoe. You’ve been bringing the fire to Star 91.9 FM since your very first show on 1 July 2021. My afternoons are going to be so different from next week.” Mufunwa M said she’ll follow Manstoe where she’s going. “Wherever you go I will be there. I will definitely miss your voice and topics,” she wrote. “God bless you Sister and may He continue to open all doors for you, enjoy your next journey Sisonke,” commented Solly Thaanes. When Manstoe joined Star FM last year, she was excited and said the four months of not being on radio felt like a lifetime. “It totally felt like a lifetime. I have never been off the radio for this long. But I took the time out to reflect on my career and reassess my journey. I spent so much needed time with my family and especially my grandmother. Loved every moment,” she had told Daily Sun at the time. This is my last week at Star FM. It's been great (and short - but effective). Cheers.
