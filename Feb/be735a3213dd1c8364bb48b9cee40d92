TWO police officers are alleged to be among the suspects who are on the run following a deadly shooting on Monday, 22 February. This was according to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokeswoman Grace Langa. Langa also revealed that some 15 of the officers involved in the shoot-out with the thugs at The Hill near Rosettenville, south of Joburg, are still traumatised. “We could not interview them because mostly are still traumatised by what happened,” she said. Meanwhile, Gauteng Premier David Makhura has also joined the chorus of those who are commending the police for their remarkable job. Makhura said: “We commend the Gauteng multidisciplinary law enforcement teams for working together in a sophisticated manner which led to the arrest of these criminals. As the provincial government, we value their determination to win the war against crime.” Yesterday’s Rossetenville shooting.

We are disappointed expect the law to take its course. Those who engage in criminal activities must face the full might of the law.” The premier highlighted that the provincial government has established a War Room on fighting crime as part of building safer communities. According to the premier’s office statement, the War Room on crime brings together all spheres of government, civil society, the private sector and critical stakeholders ensuring that together they build a safer Gauteng. “There is no place for criminals to hide in Gauteng. We call upon the people of Gauteng to join hands with the government in the fight against crime,” Makhura said.
