 THE police, who gunned down eight suspects and arrested eight more on Monday, 21 February in The Hill near Rosettenville, south of Joburg, have been hailed as heroes. Sadly, one of the four injured officers succumbed to his injuries after he was shot in the forehead. The number of arrested suspects has risen from eight to 10, with five Zimbabweans and five South Africans following the deadly shooting. From the 25 suspects, seven are still on the run. Police reaction in the area has renewed hope that there are still good women and men in blue whose focus is to fight crime. On Twitter, Maluleke said: “Salute to all the police officials who were involved in #Rosettenville shooting. May those who were wounded recover and get back to their families.” Annalise Kempen tweeted: “My thoughts and prayers are with our brave police members who were injured while fighting those who want to destroy our beautiful country through their love of money and violence. May you recover soon!” Sphithiphithi Evaluator said: “Salute to the brave police officers who risked their lives to clean the dirty streets. The kind of police we need and respect, not thugs masquerading as members of law enforcement. Well done to you! Those injured, may they recover and get trauma counselling.” Thabo Moetji tweeted: “Excellent work by the men in blue – JMPD and EMPD for decisively dealing with thugs in this country. Wishing those patriotic injured law enforcers a speedy recovery.” Gauteng Police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, told reporters on Monday evening: “Our team has been monitoring them from last week, their movement and intention. So, last week they didn’t commit any crime but decided they were going to commit crime today and our team was just behind them.” He said when they realised the police were onto them, they rushed to their safe house and “that’s where our highly trained tactical team dealt with them”.
