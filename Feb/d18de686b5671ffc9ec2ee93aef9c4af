STATE witness Tshepiso Tshita is expected to take the witness stand again on Tuesday, 8 February requested by Ntuthuko Shoba’s defence lawyer, Norman Makhubela. Tshita was Tshegofatso Pule’s childhood friend and the first witness to take the stand when the trial started. But Makhubela applied that Tshita be brought back, stating that there was a point he wanted to put to the court. The state also has one more witness before closing its case. Before court adjourned on Thursday, Vodacom forensic liaison manager Johanna Heineka testified, backing up the police’s cellphone data and records used as evidence on the matter. Sergeant Mpe Teme also completed his testimony, emphasising that Shoba did not ask for permission to do a sim swap and unlawfully did it on his own accord. The court also heard a testimony from Veli Nkonyana, the man who saw Shoba and Muzikayise Malephane conversing at Cashbuild in Meadowlands, the day after Pule’s death. Pule was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort, in June 2020. Shoba was dubbed the alleged mastermind behind the murder, hiring Malephane to execute it.
