A 70-YEAR-OLD madala, who does not want his family to struggle when he dies, has started preparing for his funeral. Kenyan news publication Tuko reported that the madala, only identified as Leo, said he had to take that step because his community found it financially hard to bury people. In a documentary aired by Afrimax, Leo said he did not want to become a burden to people after he died. A post shared by Afrimax (@afrimax_tv) “I will buy my own shirt for my burial service, pay any pastor who will be holding the funeral ceremony and provide almost anything that my family will be needing for the ceremony so they can reduce any cost when I die,” he said. It is reported that the madala, who is married to nine women, went to the extent of digging his own grave and acquiring a casket that would be used for his burial. He told Afrimax that he bought enough booze to entertain mourners who would grace his funeral.
