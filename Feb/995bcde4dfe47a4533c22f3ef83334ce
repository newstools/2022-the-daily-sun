MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Rhulani Mokwena revealed that veteran defender Ricardo Nascimento turned down an offer to work in a none playing capacity within their structures. Mokwena says Nascimento is not yet ready to hang up his boots as he still wants to play at the higher level for two more seasons either in the PSL or abroad. The Brazilian defender confirmed his departure via his twitter page on Monday ending a five-and half-year stint with the defending league champions. “The club has already extended a plan for him to stay and continue in a different capacity, but his feeling is that he's still got one or two more seasons to play, be it locally or back in his native country in Brazil,” explained Mokoena following Downs 2-0 win over Chippa United in a DStv Premiership match at Loftus Stadium on Monday. Mokwena hailed Nascimento for being a loyal servant to the club having bounced back to help the club win trophies following two operations. "A gentle giant, a humble soul, someone who is always prepared to do more than required. The reality is, when a loyal servant like Ricardo has served you with such distinction, it is only proper that you deal with his departure with the best possible dignity and respect in recognition of his profile and contribution. I'm sure the club will officially release a statement and I think that is only fair and proper.” Mokwena stressed that it will be difficult to replace Nascimento. “His performances on the pitch speak only about a player who was always willing to do more than was required of him. The qualities he possessed will be very difficult to replicate or replace, so we've got our work cut out to make sure that we get a player of the same technical and tactical qualities, if not better.”
