It is believed that due to the dark road, they couldn’t see the water and found their car swept sideways. The desperate trio managed to get out and stood on top of the car to call their relatives for help. Relative Tshegofatso Mokhonwana (36) said because the emergency services delayed, they were swept away. “We are relieved that the remains of my uncle have been found. Although it is painful to the family, at least we will know where he is laid to rest.” Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said the three bodies were found and presented to their families. Police have warned people to stay away from rivers until they subside, especially those doing rituals.
