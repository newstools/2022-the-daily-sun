GUINEA giants Horoya are eyeing AmaZulu’s scalp when the sides meet in the second group stage match of the Caf Champions League at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday night (9pm). Horoya have shown their intention of winning this match by arriving in Durban on Tuesday to acclimatise to Mzansi conditions for what is an important match for both sides. Both started the campaign on a losing note, with Usuthu losing 1-0 to Moroccan giants Raja Casablanca and ES Sétif of Tunisia beat Horoya by the same scoreline this past weekend. However, Usuthu defender Thembela Sikhakhane said ys they should make use of home ground advantage if they have aspirations of going to the knockout stages. Winning all your home games is key in the Champions League and a point away is normally enough to go through to the knockout stages. “We are motivated and we want to do well and qualify to the knockout stages,” said Sikhakhane, who featured in a loss to Raja in Casablanca on Saturday. Having beaten Malawi’s Nyasa Big Bullets in the preliminary round and five time Champions League winners TP Mazembe of DR Congo in the first round, Sikhakhane says that experience will count a lot for them. “Against TP Mazembe we knew what we wanted to do and we will approach this game in the same way,” he said. Horoya are familiar with facing Mzansi sides in either in the Champions League or Caf Confederation Cup. When SuperSport United reached the Confed Cup final in 2017, they met the Guinea side in the group stages. The Tshwane giants drew both matches against Horoya, before progressing to the knockout stages. Last season Horoya also drew both their Champions League group matches against Kaizer Chiefs. In the 2018-19 Champions League, Pirates beat Horoya 3-0 at Orlando Stadium before losing 2-1 away in the group stages.
