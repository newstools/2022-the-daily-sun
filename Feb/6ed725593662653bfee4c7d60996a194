MARITZBURG United’s new signing Friday Samu has revealed the team is fired up ahead of their DStv Premiership KwaZulu-Natal derby against Golden Arrows at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night (7.30pm). Samu said Maritzburg needed the three points more than their provincial rivals. The Team of Choice, who have won eight and lost 14 of the KZN derbies down the years, will be looking for a second win on the trot for the first time this season. Maritzburg defeated SuperSport United 2-1 in their previous match, which was the first time they won since October, easing the pressure on coach Ernst Middendorp. Samu, signed from Zambian side Green Buffaloes in January, was at the heart of that victory, brilliantly turning his marker before rifling a powerful winner past keeper Ronwen Williams. “We are working hard and need these three points,” said Samu. That win for Maritzburg against SuperSport saw them move to 12th on the Premiership table with 18 points after 19 games. Maritzburg lost to 2-1 to Arrows in the opening game of the season in KwaMashu in August, but they face an Arrows side that is also struggling. “From what I have seen, the league is competitive here. I need to push myself daily,” revealed Samu.
