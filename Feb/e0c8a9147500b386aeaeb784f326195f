PITSO Mosimane's Al Ahly advanced to the Fifa Club World Cup semi-finals after beating Mexican giants Monterrey 1-0 at Al-Nahyan Stadium in Abu Dhabi. The Egyptian giants went to this match without six key players (Mohamed El-Shennawy, Ayman Ashraf, Mohamed Abdelmoneim, Hamdi Fathi, Amr El-Sulya, and Mohamed Sherif) who are currently on national team duty at the Afcon. Ahly were also without Bafana Bafana star Percy Tau, Akram Tawfik, Salah Mohsen, Badr Benoun, and Ammar Hamdi, who are all injured. The team of the century will now face Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras for a place in the Club World Cup final. Monterrey dominated both halves of the game. However, they did not create enough scoring opportunities to get the results. Al Ahly absorbed well the pressure, and they used one of their chances to steal the match in the 53rd minute with a goal; from defender Mohamed Hany. The Mexican side did their best pushing for an equaliser, but Ahly were equal to the task, and they managed to keep a clean sheet to win the match.Monterrey will now face the losers of Sunday's game between Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal and Al Jazira in a fifth-place playoff. European champions Chelsea will enter the competition in the semi-finals, and they will face a winner of the match between Al Hilal or Jazira on 9 February. 11 Men In Red Are All What We Need! #YallaYaAhly #ClubWC pic.twitter.com/85eHih7P87
