A FAMILY wants justice for their loved one who was killed for a shot of gin. And they asked Daily Sun to help bust the killers. Sharon Mooko (46) said Sfiso Mthimkhulu (45) was killed on 1 January. She said her nephew went to Chiawelo in Soweto at around 11pm for the crossover. “After celebrating the crossover, a guy offered him a shot of gin to celebrate. When he was done drinking it, one of the two guys responsible for his murder asked why he was drinking their booze. He then hit him with a bottle,” said Sharon. They then fought, but people intervened. Sharon said Sfiso went home, but went out after 30 minutes to buy cigarettes. “One of the guys had a gun and wanted to shoot him, but Sfiso was stabbed six times by another guy while trying to take the gun away. According to eyewitnesses, Sfiso even tried to apologise because he didn’t know it was their booze,” said Sharon. She said Sfiso was a loving father of five children aged between 13 and 25. “As old as he was, he was a mamas boy and only drank once in a while. You’d never find Sfiso in booze troubles. We’re really hurt,” said Sharon. Sfiso’s mum, Phumzile Mxasa, (68) said she’s devastated to start the new year this way. She said she was in Pimville when she heard her son was hurt. “When I arrived, I saw a lot of people in my street and my heart raced. It was so full. I jumped the fence because people were not moving,” said Phumzile. She said she found her son covered with a blanket. “It was so painful to see his lifeless body. Those two boys robbed his kids of their father. I pray they are found and rot in jail,” said Phumzile. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said a case of murder was being investigated. “The two suspects involved are currently on the run and police are following up on any leads on their whereabouts,” Sello said.
