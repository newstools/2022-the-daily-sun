AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has revealed star striker Augustine Mulenga’s dip in form could be attributed to the fact that the striker enjoyed a great partnership with Sibusiso Mabiliso last season. Mulenga was a shadow of his former self in the first half of the season for Usuthu, but was also not helped with a slew of injuries that kept him on the sidelines and the fact left-back, Mabiliso, joined Kaizer Chiefs at the start of the season. The former Orlando Pirates forward’s five goals in 28 appearances helped AmaZulu finish runners-up in the DStv Premiership. McCarthy said losing Mabiliso has hampered Mulenga’s form this season, but he’s happy the Zambian international is starting to hit form again. “The injury to Mulenga in the first part of the season was a massive blow because he was in good form for us,” said McCarthy, whose side drew 0-0 with TS Galaxy at Moses Mabhida Stadium in a Premiership clash on Tuesday evening. “But you hope he will get back to the same quality and form he showed when we finished second last season,” added McCarthy. “The big factor of Mulenga’s game was taken away after we lost Mabiliso to Chiefs. “You had a full-back who was overlapping, giving him an option and now we don’t have that and we sort of lost that in the players we recruited to replace Mabiliso with.” Having struggled to replace Mabiliso, McCarthy tried to sign left-back Bongani Sam from Pirates to help revive Mulenga’s form, but Pirates rejected Usuthu’s bid in the January transfer window. While McCarthy was left with egg in the face from Pirates’s rejection, he is in pain to see Mabiliso not playing regularly at Chiefs.
