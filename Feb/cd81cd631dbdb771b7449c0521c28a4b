SEVENTEEN people were left injured after a bus allegedly lost control on the N14 near the Eeufees Road off-ramp in Tshwane on Wednesday, 16 February. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said the bus crossed both oncoming two lanes, shooting up an embankment and rolling on its side. He said paramedics arrived on the scene at about 5.28pm, and found injured passengers lying on the roadside below the bus. “They treated a seriously injured 33-year-old woman with advanced life support interventions and a moderately injured 44-year-old woman. Both were transported to hospital for further care,” Meiring said in a statement. He said that two other people suffered serious injuries while the remaining 13 escaped with minor injuries. “They were treated and transported to hospital. The SAPS, Tshwane Metro and fire department were conducting further investigations,” Meiring added.
