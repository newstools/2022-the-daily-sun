STELLENBOSCH have set their sights on challenging for the Nedbank Cup this season! This was revealed by Stellies veteran defender Marc Van Heerden ahead of their Ke Yona last-32 clash against Baroka at Danie Craven Stadium on Friday (6pm). The Cape Town-based side have been in the top flight for three seasons and are still to win silverware. But the well-travelled defender is optimistic that this is the season Steve Barker’s lads will win their first top flight trophy. Stellenbosch have been impressive in the DStv Premiership this season. They are sitting third on the log with 29 points from 18 league matches. They are 18 points behind high-flying leaders Mamelodi Sundowns who have played two more games. “Our target now is to challenge for the Nedbank Cup,” said the 33-year-old. “We are aware it is not going to be easy but we aim to give it our best shot. We have been doing well and want to do the same in the Nedbank Cup,” On their clash against struggling Bakgakga, Van Heerden said they are not taking the Limpopo-based side lightly because of their league form. Baroka are 15th with 13 points the same as bottom side TS Galaxy after 17 games but Bakgakga have a better goal difference. “Baroka are not an easy team to beat,” he explained. “They are a very difficult team to play against. They have a good team and we shouldn’t underestimate them looking at their league form. I am sure they want to do well against us to boost their confidence going into league matches.” The last time Stellenbosch played Baroka they beat them 1-0 in a league clash at the Danie Craven Stadium. “We are sure that they are also coming aiming for revenge,” said Van Heerden. “So, we should expect a tough game and we have to be at our best. The good thing is that we are playing at home and we should use that to our advantage.”
