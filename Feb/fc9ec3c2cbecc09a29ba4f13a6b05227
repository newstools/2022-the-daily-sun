PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa continued to tour the Eastern Cape over the weekend. The president was meeting with African National Congress (ANC) branches to evaluate their performance in the local government elections ahead of the party’s elective conference in December. This came as Ramaphosa’s ally, Premier Oscar Mabuyane faced serious challenges for the provincial chairmanship as his allies in regional conferences were defeated. Mabuyane is being challenged by Babalo Madikizela, whose allies have won several regional conferences, including the second and third largest, Amathole and Alfred Nzo. Recent reports suggest that if Madikizela wins, his faction is likely to endorse Ramaphosa for a second term. However, Daily Sun has learnt that Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has been cosying up to the faction. Speaking to reporters, Ramaphosa said he found engagements with branches enriching. Members shared their views on why the party performed poorly in the local government elections. “The commitment they were demonstrating was quite uplifting. I found that at times, we think we know the ANC is weak but it is when you talk to the branch leaders, who are running our branches on the ground, that you see the ANC is still alive,” he said. Speaking about the war between Russia and Ukraine, Ramaphosa refused to publicly go against International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor, who recently issued a statement saying Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine immediately. The president, who was reportedly enraged by the statement, said the government’s view was that the matter should be left in the hands of meditators. “We have made our position clear. War, in our view, is devastating to everyone, to ordinary people, the country where war is being waged, and we have called for mediation,” he said.
