FOR years, residents of Delft in Cape Town woke up to piles of rubbish dumped in the open space opposite their homes. To deal with the problem, the gogos in the kasi decided to make gardens where they grow vegetables to eat and sell for profit. Gogo Nomaindia Tatsi said four years ago, they even found a dead body on top of a rubbish bin. “Now that we have started the garden, people do not throw rubbish in front of our homes anymore,” said the gogo. “We have hit two birds with one stone because we dealt with the rubbish problem, and grow vegetables for ourselves.” They grow cabbage, green pepper, carrots, spinach, onions and tomatoes.  “We sell to other residents and get some money to buy bread and other household needs. Our prices are a little lower than the prices people pay on the streets. “If six tomatoes go for R10 on the streets, we sell 10 tomatoes for R10,” she said. Gogo Nombuyiselo Dyani (65) said she started working on the garden last February. “I have been sitting at home doing nothing, so I decided to join other people who are gardening. “My 32-year-old daughter who is unemployed joined me, and we sell our veggies and put food on the table. On a good day we can make sales of R100 and that money helps us to buy bread and electricity,” she said. Besides selling, the gogos said their gardens were a source of healthy food for their families. “We will never sleep on an empty stomachs as long as we have our garden,” said Gogo Nombuyiselo.
