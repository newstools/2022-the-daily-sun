WHEN Sergeant Nonhlanhla Monama received information from a community forum member about a newborn baby found dumped, she quickly responded to the complaint. The 38-year-old cop, stationed at Phola Police Station in Mpumalanga, was accompanied by his colleague Sergeant Mojalefa Manaka. When they arrived at the scene between Mabelane’s Place and old Roman Church on Thursday, 3 February, they found the baby girl covered in an old blanket with her umbilical cord still hanging and blood stains next to her. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, both Monama and Manaka realised the newborn was running out of breath. “The officers were worried that if they delayed, the baby might lose her life. They rushed her to the clinic where she was examined. She is in good health,” he said. Mohlala said that the police welcomed the contribution the members made to ensure the baby survives. “It is our responsibility as the police to make sure we assist everyone whether it’s an infant or elderly person. We commend the action made by the CPF member as well as our members,” he said A case of child neglect has been opened and no arrests have been made. Mohlala said an investigation was underway. He further encouraged community members to always seek help when faced with challenging situations. He said: “The government has various departments that can assist, either the Department of Health and the Department of Social Development. We encourage them to seek the relevant help,” he said. Police are appealing to anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspect to contact the Phola detectives branch commander Captain Christina Xaba on 076 605 4760 or 013 643 8601.
