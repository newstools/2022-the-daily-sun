R adio and TV personality Dineo Ranaka has returned to the music space with a new hot track titled   Ukhona. The song featuring Nokwazi and Regalo Joints comes two years after her debut single, Sibahle, in 2019. Dineo spoke to SunBuzz about Ukhona, whichwas released two weeks ago. “When Ukhona was made, I wanted something spiritual and uplifting. I wanted people to feel motivated and feel they can change whatever they want to,” said Dineo. “The song refers to God when it says ukhona (He is here). We’re not alone. We don’t go alone. “We have to remember that whatever we go through, He’s there. Nokwazi came through and delivered really hard. I was really blown away by how she did it,” she said. The reality TV star has been a DJ for four years and she recently started producing. She said it felt like the right time to start releasing songs. “I took my time to master the craft. I wanted to respect and learn it. I was still learning about the technical aspects and commercial aspects to monetise being a DJ and I did. I also had to wait and identify the kind of sound I want. Now I’m sure about it. ALSO READ | LERATO MVELASE GOES BACK TO SCHOOL “I’m sure about the image, branding, my skill set and more. Also, people in the industry are vouching for me,” she said. “I think there is no better timing than now. I’ve just completed my initiation as a sangoma. Things are aligning. I’m feeling stronger and wiser. I feel more 360. I’m the full Dineo and I’m more confident.” She is currently in studio, working on more singles. “I’ll definitely be dropping a lot of singles this year. “I’ve spoken to Lady Du about getting in studio with her, and she has given me her blessing. I’ve spoken to Dlala Thukzin and so many other producers that I’m looking forward to working with. Only in the first quarter of next year will I drop a full body of work,” said Dineo. Ukhona is available on Traxsource and YouTube for now.
