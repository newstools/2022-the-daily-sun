A FAMILY from Lower Cross Roads was shocked after a Toyota Quantum crashed into their shack and destroyed their belongings on Friday afternoon. The mother of the house, Nolubabalo Robi (43), told SunTeam that she was inside her shack doing some chores while her daughter was asleep on the bed. The next thing she had a loud bang outside but she thought some cars had collided on the road since they live along Sheffield Road. Before she could go outside to check what was happening, she was shocked to see her shack falling apart while they were inside. “The next thing I saw a Quantum idling next to my wardrobe also close to my bed where my daughter was sleeping. I was shocked and I quickly dragged my daughter who was half asleep out of the shack as I feared it was going to totally collapse on our heads,” said Nolubabalo. Gogo Mavis Robi (65) said she was called to the scene after the incident since she lives a few streets away. “I thank God and my ancestors for saving my daughter and grandchild, otherwise things could have been worse. She lost her property but she is not injured. I just want the taximan to fix my daughter’s shack and have all the broken things repaired,” said gogo Mavis. The taxi owner who spoke to Daily Sun said the driver is his son. “I’m teaching him about the industry and I’m disappointed by what he did. I’m going to fix this shack today so that the family gets somewhere to put their head. We will fix other things afterwards,” said the taximan, who didn’t want to be named and to be photographed. Witnesses who saw the incident happening said they young driver was speeding and when he swayed out of the road and crashed into the shack
