“THE decision to join ActionSA was as difficult as leaving the DA, which was my political home for years, actually since I was a boy. I joined this party because I want to see real change and all change comes with action. That’s one of the reasons I’m here.” Those were the words of ex -Democratic Alliance leader Athol Trollip after joining ActionSA. The former mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Athol Trollip announced on Wednesday, 9 February that he was joining the party. Trollip was one of the DA leaders who quit the party in 2019 in protest against Helen Zille’s election as chairwoman of the federal council. He had resigned from politics but has now returned. At a press conference held at Radisson Blu Hotel in Gqeberha, Trollip was announced as ActionSA’s Eastern Cape chairman.  He made it clear he would not be bashing his former party but would be recruiting people he had worked with in the DA. Trollip said municipalities across the Eastern Cape had turned into circuses because they had clowns in councils. “I was part of a circus in this city and I know what that feels like. I’m here to bring back nobility. “I joined ActionSA because when I was out of politics, I was exposed to how hopeless people feel with the government.” Mashaba said he was happy to welcome Trollip to the party’s senate as the fifth provincial chair of the party. “People of the Eastern Cape, let me apologise for not participating in last year’s elections. We had many requests but we didn’t want to overstretch ourselves as a new party. Today, that has all changed,” he said. “In 2024, the party will contest all nine provinces, including Eastern Cape, which delivered the freedom we are enjoying today but is one of the most ignored provinces.”
