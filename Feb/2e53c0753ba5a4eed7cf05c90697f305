A FOETUS, with a smile and yawn, has touched the hearts of social media users. The unborn baby has been named Zingce by mum, activist and author Zoleka Mandela. She shared the video clip and a photo of her unborn baby on her social media pages. “Queens, are you seeing my baby yawning and possibly wanting me to eat something? This little person has me making trips to the bathroom to pee every two seconds, to the kitchen for something to eat all the time and literally spends the entire day kick-boxing my bladder. No wonder they’re so tired! Look at that face. How can I be so freaking blessed to have this baby choose me? #ZolekaMandelaVideos#BabyZingce #41YrOldMotherOf6,” she captioned the post. In a previous post, the unborn baby can be seen literally smiling. Zoleka captioned the post: “And whenever I lose my smile, I’ll always remember that I still have yours, Zingce. OMG queens, my baby is always smiling. I’m literally smiling on the inside too. I think this is my smile. This was today’s 4D scan; today’s reminder of how truly blessed I am, just this way. I wouldn’t change any of it for the world.” ALSO READ | AMAPIANO FIGHT TURNS UGLY Her friends and fans couldn’t stop gushing over the unborn baby.
