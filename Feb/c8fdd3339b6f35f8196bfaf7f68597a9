CHRISTMAS has come early for some university students. They were overjoyed when they were recently told they would get funding from media personality Lasizwe Dambuza’s drive #R10GoesALongWay. With money he raised, the YouTuber and reality TV star will be paying the registration fees of 317 undergraduate students. A set number of people were initially going to get funding, but it has since been announced that everyone who applied would benefit. Lasizwe and friends Sibu Mabena, Ayanda Mhlongo and Takkies Dinwiddy raised over R2 million in two weeks in 2021. They raised over R1,6 million for the 2022 academic year, getting support from private citizens and companies such as MultiChoice, Standard Bank, Pick N Pay and Vuma. Lasizwe told Daily Sun they were happy to help students get to university. “It’s a feeling I can’t explain, just being able to help people enter university, to get them close to their dreams,” he said.

I’m so grateful I was able to do this.” In 2021, the star was accused of stealing the money he raised and ended up posting a video in which he cried and insisted he was innocent. He said looking back, it really hurt him. “It felt like when you do good, people just really don’t care. We live in a hurt world and I get where it’s coming from because corruption is a real thing in our country and we live it,” he said. However, he said he was happy this year’s drive was a success,” he said. “I’m happy we got to pay for everyone who applied for the fund. A big thank you to Fundi for helping us throughout the whole journey,” he said. “I also want to thank my partners, Sib, Ayandamantombaze and Takkies for holding my hand throughout this whole process. I’m really proud of all of us.”
