T HE past seven years have been difficult for Idols SA 2014 second runner-up, Bongi Silinda. She revealed to SunBuzz how she has been trying to deal with the ups and downs of the entertainment industry. “I gave Idols SA my all but I guess I wasn’t good enough. I even believe the judges already knew what they were looking for and no matter how much I tried, I wasn’t going to win,” said Bongi. “Despite this, I am not bitter. I am grateful for the opportunity and exposure.” She said the past seven years have been difficult. “When I joined Idols SA, I got used to the spotlight. But once the show was over, the spotlight soon dimmed. I had to face the world on my own.

I didn’t want to be forgotten by my fans.” Bongi said she has been doing a lot of collaborations. “I’ve had an opportunity to work with the likes of Polamo, Linda Gcwensa, Masandi from Ghana, DJ Ganyani, DJ Sdunkero and Soul Kulture. “I enjoyed working with them but there’s always been a demand from fans to release a full album,” she said. She said she would release it later this year. “I’ve just released my debut song titled Sondzela, inspired by my love life. “I was in a relationship for some time, but things did not work out. I was hurting, especially because Valentine’s and my birthday were approaching. The song was composed out of pain.” It was meant to accommodate everyone who wanted to experience love. “I poured my heart out looking for answers and validation. I might not have found the answers but was satisfied to have found healing.” The song that is available online.
