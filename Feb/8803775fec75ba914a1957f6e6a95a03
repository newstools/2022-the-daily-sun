The people of Kyiv waited anxiously for an expected Russian
assault on the Ukrainian capital on Friday after a night spent cowering in
makeshift air raid shelters or their homes. Missiles pounded Kyiv overnight and air raid sirens wailed,
increasing fears among residents who did not flee the city of 3 million on
Thursday that an assault was imminent. At times, explosions and gunfire could
be heard. One resident of southeast Kyiv, who gave his name only as
Sergei, said he woke at around 4 a.m. and went out to the balcony of his
apartment for a smoke. He heard an explosion and saw a flash in the skies in front
of him. Five seconds later an explosion shook his 10-storey residential
building not far from Boryspil international airport. "Glass flew all around. There's now a shell fragment in
my kitchen. I was shocked," he told Reuters. Nobody in his family was
hurt.  A Reuters reporter saw a two-metre-deep crater full of
rubble in the ground next to the building and windows had been shattered. A
policeman on the scene said nobody was killed but several people were badly
hurt. One resident, Oxana Gulenko, a military medic whose father
fought for the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, said she was thrown by the
explosion about three metres from her bed.  "How we can live through it in our time? What should we
think? (Russian President Vladimir) Putin should be burnt in hell along with
his whole family," she said, cleaning away broken glass in her apartment. Others cleared away rubble in the street.  Anatoliy Marchenko, 57, who served in the Soviet army, will
have to repair his balcony after the strike and could not find his cat, which
ran away during shelling. "I'm ashamed that I speak Russian," he said and
switched to Ukrainian. "I know people there (in Russia), they are my
friends. What do they need from me? A war has come to my house and that's
it."
