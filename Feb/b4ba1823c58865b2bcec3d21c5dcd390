CHELSEA’S deadly striker Romelu Lukaku took social media by storm this week when he showed off his new Maserati MC20. “My new baby! Welcome to the #MaseratiMC20 team, let’s be audacious,” he posted on Facebook. It is without a doubt that the Belgian soccer star has one of the most beautiful cars in the world. Maserati MC20 won Product Design of the Year at the European Product Design Awards in 2021. MC20, designed by the Centro Stile Maserati in Turin, is a mixture of elegance and sporting prowess. The super sports car is a genuine masterpiece of style, the first of its kind. It boasts the new Nettuno engine, a 630 horsepower (463kW) V6 with a torque of 730Nm that delivers 0-100km/h acceleration in under 2,9 seconds and a top speed of over 325km an hour. Brace yourself because you might see this car on the streets since it made its way to Mzansi last year.
