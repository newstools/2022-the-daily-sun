FIVE thugs reportedly robbed passengers in a bus, and then asked them for divine intervention. Modern Ghana reports that on Monday, 21 February, five armed thugs carrying riffles succeeded in robbing over 40 passengers who were travelling in a luxury bus from Takoradi to Kumasi, Ghana. In an interview with Connect FM, a woman, only identified as Ekua for fear of victimisation, said the suspects were wearing masks when they attacked the bus. “At around 3.30am, about five armed robbers with rifles and other weapons attacked us. They made away with our monies and other belongings. All of them were wearing masks,” the victim said. She told the radio station that when they were done, the robbers asked passengers to pray for them. The thugs reportedly indicated that they were forced to steal from people because of the hardships in the country. “They asked us to pray for them because it was not their will to stop vehicles on the highway and rob passengers of their belongings, but the system had compelled them to do so,” she narrated. Local cops said they were investigating the incident.
