THE advancement of technology is growing at such a rapid rate that we are now seeing things we never thought would be possible now being attempted and made possible. The new artificial intelligence nanny has arrived, and it could help with the current population crisis that China is currently faced with. If you have seen the movie The Matrix, then this should ring a bell as robotics and artificial intelligence can now assist in the development of newborns via the use of algorithms and artificial wombs. This artificial womb is a big machine containing compartments for individual foetuses. The infants will be fed as they would be in a real womb if they are in the chamber, which will be filled with an optimised mix of “nutritious fluids. ”According to the South China Morning Post, Chinese experts in Suzhou have pioneered the development of the latest technological breakthrough. However, there are concerns about the ethical implications of raising human beings in an artificial environment. The discoveries were published in the Journal of Biomedical Engineering by Suzhou-based scientists. The artificial intelligence nanny might aid in the growth of human kids in a “long-term embryo culture device.” The artificial human growth will enable couples who would otherwise be at danger during delivery to have children.
