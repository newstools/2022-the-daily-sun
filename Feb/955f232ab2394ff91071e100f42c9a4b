A MAN from Springs, Ekurhuleni, lost all hope of finding his car after it was hijacked earlier last week in the Springs CBD. But on Friday, 25 February, the man came to the CBD to run some errands and could not believe his eyes when he saw his car parked on the side of the road. It was undamaged and the number plates had not been changed. He waited outside to see if the man who drove the car was the same man who hijacked him and called the cops. By the time the hijacker saw the cops it was too late to get away. All he could do was wait at the car for the cops to come for him. “He could not produce papers for the car nor give them answers about where he got the car and he was bust,” said Captain Johannes Ramphora. He said the suspect would appear in court this week in connection with hijacking. The car was taken to the Springs Police Station. The car owner said: “When I saw it I thought I was dreaming. I did not want to approach the hijacker as he was going to drive away and I could end up not getting it.” He said he thought the angels had abandoned him. “But they have proven to be with me all the time,” he said.
