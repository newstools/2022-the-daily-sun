CONTROVERSIAL podcaster MacGyver “MacG” Mukwevho is a dad, once again. The media personality has revealed that his long-term girlfriend, Naledi, welcomed their baby girl. “Yesterday, I had the most beautiful day of my life.

And, he told the podcaster, who is afraid that one day his daughter would be having sex, that daughters gravitated more towards their fathers. “That comes naturally and boys towards their mothers. Just be there for her and love her. You’re going to be her superhero and have to be the first man she falls in love with. When these boys come through in high school and have nice things to offer, she has already had that. And, disappoint her as little as possible,” he said. MacG also jokingly shared that her daughter already had a boyfriend because another child was born around the same time, with people suggesting that they should be together, but he disagreed.
