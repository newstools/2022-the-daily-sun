REALITY star Philile Vilakazi from hit show Mnakwethu Happily Ever After is caught between a rock and a hard place. This as her family and traditional healer Mzokhona Mbeje are fighting over her. Mbeje and his wife Funeka Danca claimed Philile is back in Mbeje’s arms, but she said she was trapped. He said: “I can confirm Philile and I are back together. She still visits and spends time with me. She loves me and she is no longer angry, but her family is interfering in our affairs. “I wish they can step aside so she can be free. As we speak, her family has called her back and I believe they want to separate us, but they will not win. “MaVilakazi is mine.” He said he will not stop fighting for her. “When I want something, I fight for it. MaVilakazi belongs to me and we are in this together,” he said. ALSO READ : THANDO: RADIO CHOSE ME! The news was also confirmed by MaDanca. “My husband and MaVilakazi are back together. She visited ubaba and I had a brief chat with her. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose our conversation.” But MaVilakazi denied everything. “Mbeje and his wife trapped me. I had no intentions of going back there, but MaDanca phoned and begged me. Eventually, I felt obliged to go back and explain my stance. The agreement was I’d meet only MaDanca and not Mbeje. When I arrived, MaDanca was alone. She was begging me to become Mbeje’s second wife, but I refused. I didn’t even sleep at Mbeje’s house.” In one of the January episodes of Mnakwethu, Mbeje confessed he gave Philile a love potion. “I was scared she’d dump me and find someone else. I also wanted to build harmony between my wife and Philile. “I gave her a love potion. For the past three years she was under my love spell and she was in love with me,” he said. At that time, he had also insisted that MaVilakazi would be back in his arms.
