Eerste Fabriek squatter camp was swept away by flood water once again on Saturday, 5 February. Hundreds of people had to be evacuated and placed in community halls around Mamelodi, Tshwane, three years after 600 families were left homeless after heavy rain in 2019. Speaking on behalf of flood victims, December Matlala said they had been asking to be relocated since 2019 and rumours that they had refused to leave were untrue. “The municipality made promises to move us but nothing has happened.”  Resident Anna Mabochaba (46) said she lost everything she rebuilt after 2019. “The first time, we were taken to a church and left there with nothing. Now we are also being taken to community halls to be abandoned until we decide to move back here.” Meanwhile, Tshwane Emergency Services had to respond to flooding incidents after thundershowers hit Gauteng on Friday, 4 February and continued into the early hours of the following morning.  Spokesman Charles Mabaso said flooding was reported at Eerste Fabriek Banana Bridge and about 800 people were affected. He said the provincial government and municipality sent buses to evacuate people to temporary accommodation. “Two SAPS helicopters identified about 60 people on the rooftops of their dwellings.” Mabaso said when rescue teams tried to evacuate them, people threw objects at them. “Reports of flooded houses and unoccupied vehicles were also reported in Montana Park and Doornpoort. Roads and bridges in Centurion were flooded, leading to the closure of the routes.”
