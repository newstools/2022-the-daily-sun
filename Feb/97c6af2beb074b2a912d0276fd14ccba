The muthi battle between a wife and a nyatsi has left the 43-year-old wife with a husband who won’t poke her – and even if he tries, his erection can’t stand up to the occasion. The woman from Actonville, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she’s been married to her husband for 13 years and she knows he has cheated on her several times. In September she found out her husband was cheating on her again and this time she decided to fight the nyatsi because she had already tried to sort out her husband and the woman was from her kasi. “We were even in a stokvel together,” she said. She went to a sangoma. “The sangoma told me this woman was already using muthi to try and destroy my marriage,” she said. She said the sangoma gave her some muthi to burn while communicating with her ancestors. She did as she was instructed and early in January, she bumped into the nyatsi at the mall. “I confronted her and threatened to block her punani,” she said. But a week later, her husband’s 4-5 started failing when it was time to poke. Now the husband doesn’t want to poke her anymore and told her she needed to fix whatever was wrong with her punani. “This makes me angry. We’ve got this problem because of him!” she said. Daily Sun spoke to the husband (49) who said he regretted cheating and would try his best to stop. He said he didn’t know why his 4-5 fails. He also said he had stopped seeing the other woman and would help his wife through this journey of getting her punani sorted out. The sangoma she consulted, Gogo Hlongo Mngomezulu, confirmed the husband’s 4-5 is affected by the muthi the nyatsi was using to block the wife’s punani. She said in order for them to get their bedroom life back and to protect their marriage, they’d need to do certain things together. “It can’t just be the wife,” said Gogo Hlongo. Daily Sun tried speaking to the nyatsi but she hung up when the reporter said she’s from the newspaper.
