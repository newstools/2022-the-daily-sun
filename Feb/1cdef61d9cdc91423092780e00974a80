THE cop and his friend were allegedly car racing at night when the latter lost control. The car first ploughed into a man who was locking the gate, and killed him. It then moved to the next house and crushed into a wall. The two tried to flee, but resident Solly Nkoana of Mpho Section in Tembisa locked them in a room. Police were called, and arrested them on Wednesday, 2 February. Solly said he held the car so his wall and house could get fixed. “They are busy fixing the house,” he said. He said he almost died as the car found him standing between the wall and house. WATCH: ONE MORE YEAR FOR R350 GRANT! “I jumped over my tenant’s car, that was parked not far from the wall,” he said. The debris of the wall crushed the car and it had to be fixed. But Phuthi Somo’s family fear they might not get justice. “We fear the case might be swept under the carpet because we have not received a case number. We go to the station but don’t get helped. We suspect cops are trying to protect their colleague,” said Phuti’s sister, Patricia. About the incident, she said: “My mum heard wheels screeching.” They went out to investigate, and saw someone lying on the ground. Then they noticed it was her brother, and he was already dead. A case of murder and malicious damage to property was opened at Tembisa cop shop. The police had not responded to our questions at the time of going to print.
