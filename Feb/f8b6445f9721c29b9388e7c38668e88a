BONISIWE Masuku believes singing is her calling. The rising star says she was meant to sing and heal people with her voice. Bonisiwe (34) who hails from Emalahleni in Mpumalanga told SunBuzz why her music is meant to touch people’s hearts and souls. “Music is my calling and I’m here to heal through my voice. I was born with rhythms and songs trapped in my tiny hands. Most of the times I dream of my songs and how they should sound. The love of music flows naturally. What inspires me to write and produce music is love, life, and the good and bad things happening around me, even across the world,” she said. Bonisiwe, who grew up singing from the age of six, studied music theory at Unisa in 2010 and later studied piano with Free Jazz Academy in Pretoria.

In my teen years I started songwriting and composing music. I also used to sing a lot at community events such as funerals and weddings. “Music was so special to me that I’d even teach it. I liked to gather young people around my community and teach them how to sing and compose songs. That’s when I decided to go to school for music.” The passionate Bonisiwe has been working on her music since 2010 and dropped a new EP titled Umlayezo in December. “It has six soulful songs that people are loving. I worked with Zakhele Mabena as a producer, Sibusiso Masilela as a guitarist and I also featured award-winning bassist Bheka Mthethwa on one of the songs. “What inspired the EP are the messages I have for people, and the healing I believe I carry through my voice. The EP is titled Umlayezo, which means message. “So, there’s a lot of messages about hope, love and ubuntu. The project was basically introducing who Bonisiwe Masuku is and what I’m all about,” she said. Bonisiwe’s EP is available on all digital streaming platforms.
