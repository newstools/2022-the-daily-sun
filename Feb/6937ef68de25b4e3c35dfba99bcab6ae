OVER 64 cases of typhoid have been detected in the Western Cape and the Department of Health is on high alert towards dealing with the problem. The National Institute for Communicable Disease said Gauteng and North West provinces were also affected, but the Western Cape was leading with 64 cases. Provincial health spokesman Mark van der Heever said the number of laboratory-confirmed enteric fever cases detected in the province during 2021/22 was higher than in previous years, with City of Cape Town Metro, Cape Winelands and Garden Route districts reporting more cases than expected. “The identification and investigation of enteric fever cases and clusters involves ongoing surveillance and line listing, thorough case management, contact tracing and environmental investigations (food, water and sanitation) and health promotion activities. All recent single cases and clusters are currently under investigation by the districts, sub-districts and local authorities,” said Van der Heever. He said that the response teams had been activated with guidance for further public health and surveillance activities received from the institute’s enteric unit. He said the district municipality environmental health services officials were part of the response teams to address sanitation and water safety-related issues. “They are responsible for the routine monitoring of municipal water supply to communities, that involves routine sampling for indicator organisms.”
