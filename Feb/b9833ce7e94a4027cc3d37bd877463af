PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa had all of us hoping that in his State of the Nation Address he’d tell us how he was going to deal with unemployment, poverty, and other problems. We’ve heard enough of him vowing to crack the whip on corruption. He must just do it. Most importantly, we wanted him to tell us about implementation. It is comforting to hear him saying the country is entering a defining moment and has to define itself on this new path. The president has to be reminded these ideas are good and need a good leader to see to it that they see the light of day. He said there was a need to address the immediate crisis and create conditions for long-lasting stability and development. “South Africa needs a new consensus born out of a common understanding of our current challenging situation and a recognition of the need to address unemployment, poverty and inequality,” he said on Thursday evening. We’ve heard this before and that government will deal with corruption. Ramaphosa recommitted government to priorities identified in his address last year. These were defeating Covid-19, a massive infrastructure roll-out, an increase in local production, an employment stimulus and rapid expansion of energy generation capacity. “As the social partners – government, labour, business and communities – we are working to determine the actions we will take together.” He said Mzansi needed an agreement with all role players on the common understanding of the current challenges. Committing to revitalising the economy and ending inequality and injustice, as well as fighting corruption and ensuring those responsible for state capture were punished, he said our economic problems were deep and structural. “There are moments in the life of a nation when old certainties are unsettled and new possibilities emerge. There is prospect of great progress and the risk of reversal.”
