AMAZULU got themselves back in the reckoning of the Champions League knockout stages. The Durban-based side, who lost to Raja Casablanca last Friday in Morocco, defeated Guinean side Horoya 1-0 in the second Group B match at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday night. Luvuyo Memela provided a lovely goal, flicking the ball past Moussa Camara in the 31st minute. With Raja having defeated Setif 1-0 in the other match to remain top with six points after two matches, Usuthu moved to second in the group just ahead of Setif. Before Memela’s intervention, AmaZulu should have scored before then. However, new signing Abraham Majok scuffed his shot when he was inside the box instead of picking up the spot. But after the persistent creative play by the home side, they found the breakthrough and Memela was on hand with a delicious heel. This after Majok drew his men out to swap directions with Augustine Mulenga, who laid the pass to Memela to see Usuthu open the scoring. Usuthu should have added the second goal with Majok yawning in front of the goal, and his header was blocked before it crossed the line by Khadim Diaw just five minutes before halftime. Having previously met SuperSport United, Mamelodi Sundowns, Bidvest Wits, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, this was the sixth trip for Horoya in South Africa. They had only lost once, which was against Pirates in the Champions League group stages in the 2018-19 season, before losing in this match to AmaZulu. The defeat leaves Horoya rooted at the bottom of the group without any points as they also to Setif last week.Just early in the second half, Usuthu escaped the danger of the Guineans. Naby Soumah’s shot crashed the crossbar in the 48th minute, and Bonface Haba’s follow-through went wide, with Veli Mothwa relieved. Usuthu will be in action in the competition when they host Setif on Friday. But before that, they will face TS Galaxy in the DStv Premiership clash at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Wednesday.
