TWO men in their 30s have died, while a third man and a woman suffered critical injuries in a head-on collision on Sunday evening, 6 February. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said their paramedics arrived on the scene on Zuurfontein Road in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, at 6.15pm, along with the fire department and other law enforcement. He said two light motor vehicles were found standing opposite each other in the road. “Two males were found to have suffered fatal injuries and were entrapped in the one vehicle. Both showed no signs of life and were declared dead on arrival,” Meiring said. He said a third man, believed to be 25 years old, was found outside the same vehicle, having suffered critical injuries. “He was treated with Advanced Life Support interventions before being transported through to Tembisa Provincial Hospital for further emergency treatment. “A woman in her 30s was found in the other vehicle, also having suffered critical injuries,” Mering said. He said the woman was treated with advanced life support interventions before being airlifted by medical helicopter to a private hospital for further care. The circumstances leading to the accident are yet to be established.
