 Many South Africans will be looking to 2022 as the kickstart they need to start living a healthier lifestyle. This may include relooking their mental health, exercise regime or eating plans for the new year.With research from the South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition indicating that there’s been an increasing number of deaths resulting from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high-blood or largely lifestyle-related diseases which may be prevented by interventions such as a healthy diet, trying a plant-based diet which has numerous health benefits may be worth looking into.Don’t be afraid to make a changeAs a nation of meat-eaters, the term plant-based might sound a little scary but according to dietician Aziwe Booi, all this means is a diet rich in vegetables, wholegrains, legumes, nuts, seeds and fruits that does not include meat products. Starting to incorporate plant-based foods into your diet may raise questions about protein – if your protein – which keeps you fuller for longer- isn’t coming from chicken or beef then how do you get your daily intake from plants?What is plant-based?Booi explains, “Certain plants such as legumes, wholegrains and nuts contain plant-based proteins which is good for preventing non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high-blood pressure, for example.” In addition to helping to reduce disease, some of the other health benefits of a plant-based diet include gaining energy, building muscle (when exercising), reduction of fat intake which is good for heart and organ health, and it aids in weight management.Adding plant-based proteins into your eating plan can start with something as simple as breakfast. ProNutro, for example, contains a high amount of plant-based protein natural powder, is a source of Vitamin A, vitamin B and iron and makes a nutritious breakfast for families wanting to start with incorporating plant-based into their daily lives.“This type of plant-based protein is good for gut health and the digestive system, most notably it is also good for mental health. By including more plant-based food such as fruit and vegetables into your diet you can also reduce the risk of certain mood disorders,” says Booi. Can your family afford it?
