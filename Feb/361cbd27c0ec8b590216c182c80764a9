SCHOOL vendors from Mamelodi, Tshwane, are pleading with the Department of Basic Education to allow them to sell at schools. The vendors said they have been struggling to feed their families since they were told to stop selling food and snacks to pupils at the start of the lockdown in March 2020. The vendors, along with Batho Ba Rena Civil and Black Nationalist Rights Forum, marched to the department’s offices on Thursday, 24 February, to hand over a memorandum of demands. They said they want a response in seven working days. Vendor Thembi Masilela (47) said she has been making a living by selling at schools since 2000. She said: “As a single parent, this has been the only way for me to survive.” ALSO READ | REPORT: CHILD SUPPORT GRANT TOO
LITTLE! She said the government is oppressing them while they know there are no jobs available for people her age. Vendor Mapule Zulu (45) said they used to put bread on the table from the little money they made. “I feel the principals are oppressing us because when we try to speak to them, they tell us to contact the district,” said Mapule. General secretary of the Batho Ba Rena Forum, Batseba Nchabeleng said they were supporting the vendors. “The district office released a memo during level five that instructed school vendors not to sell food and snacks to pupils but that poses a great disadvantage to their rights of making a living,” she said.

Paula Galego from the Department of Basic Education received the memorandum and said the matter will be attended to.
