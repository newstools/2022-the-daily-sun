WHILE the Zulu nation was celebrating King Cetshwayo and the Battle of Isandlwana, the royal house was very unhappy. Members of the royal family have complained that the heroic king’s grave is in a bad condition. The grave in Nkandla, northern KZN, has been abandoned in a bushy area with long grass and King Cetshwayo District Municipality has not been maintaining it. Royal house spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu told Daily Sun he went to check on the grave recently. “It’s not in a good condition. If you see the fame of the battle and the dignitaries that attend the commemoration and then ask yourself where his grave is, you will be disappointed. “I want to advise the government if they want to take care of it or fix it, they must first report to us as the royal families to allow us to do rituals,” he said. “They must give us a month to prepare before they take care of the grave.” Mayor Thami Ntuli said he had noted the royal family’s concern and would fix the grave as he was a servant of King Misuzulu. “I will fix the grave in the current financial year. I’m the one who allocates the budget. It will be fixed,” he said. The SunTeam visited the grave and found it isolated among bushes and long grass. It was difficult to get to it.
