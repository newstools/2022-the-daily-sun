MAMELODI Sundowns are set to welcome a new member of their technical team. According to SunSport sources, Flemming Berg from Denmark will join the PSL champions as Sporting Director in April. Downs have brought in Berg because former president Patrice Motsepe, who now heads the Confederation of African Football (Caf) is allegedly not impressed after Sundown failed to be part of the inaugural African Under-16 School Championship that was held in DR Congo. The Caf president Motsepe, with his Motsepe foundation last May, donated  $10 million (R151,935, 000) for the establishment of the Fifa-Caf Pan-African School Football Championship. Berg’s club, DBU has already issued an official statement on his departure this month, saying. “Everyone in Danish football owes Flemming Berg a big thank you for his great and tireless efforts and contribution to the development of Danish football,” football director Peter Møller said on the club’s official website. Berg, who will officially take up his new role on 1 April this year, will be responsible for a variety of things in the club, including the hiring and firing of coaches, scouting, recruitment of players, long-term strategy and the improvement of facilities. Sundowns, in appointing Berg, will follow the footsteps of Kaizer Chiefs who appointed Kaizer Motaung Junior as Sporting Director late last year. This will not be the first time Sundowns appoint a sporting director. The Brazilian’s previous Sporting Director was a Spanish international Jose Ramon Alexanko. However, he left in 2020 due to family reasons to return to Spain and the position has remained vacant.
