THE water crisis affecting villagers in the Eastern Cape is worse than load shedding. This is according to Al Jama-ah MP Ganief Hendricks, who recently visited villages affected by water shortages as part of the Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation. Many Eastern Cape dams have run dry. In areas such as Nelson Mandela Bay, dams are close to empty and the combined dam level sits at 17,44%, while the combined provincial dam level is at 63,2%. One of the most affected dams is the Kouga dam, with a water level of 16,78%. Hendricks said: “There are already day zero water levels in the province. Al Jama-ah is concerned officials of the water department have ignored reports from the Nana tribe of zero water in Kariega. Even more disappointing is the newly-elected councillors’ failure to join the two-day oversight visit.” Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the period between January and March was the hottest and driest in the province. “Reducing water consumption is extremely critical as the water status remains dire with no significant increase in dam levels, although we have had rain recently,” he said.
