Khumbulani Konco has bagged himself a new opportunity in football following his appointment as the new Chief Operations Officer (C.O.O) of Chippa United. This after the C.O.O position was left vacant by the promotion of the club’s Executive Director, Lukanyo Mzinzi last month. The Chilli Boys announced on Wednesday that former Bloemfontein Celtic Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O) has been appointed to take the role. “Khumbulani requires no introduction within the football fraternity, being a veteran of over 20 years with Bloemfontein Celtic FC where he rose through the ranks from player to C.E.0 and established himself by later serving on the Executive Board of the Premier Soccer League as its youngest member at the time,” read a statement from the club. The highly experienced Konco has since served in several leadership roles at Celtic before leaving the club in 2021 after 20 years of service. Konco will be expected to manage the club’s first-team affairs, development of young talent, and brand promotion amongst other things. Chairman, Siviwe Mpengesi has expressed his best wishes for Konco in his new role.
