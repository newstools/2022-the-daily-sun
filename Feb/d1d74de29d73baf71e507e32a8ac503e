A medical doctor (42) was released on bail by the Mthatha Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Wednesday, 16 February, for allegations of Road Accident Fund (RAF) fraud. Captain Yolisa Mgolodela said between February 2008 and 2019, the doctor was alleged to have treated 75 patients who were involved in nine different accidents. “She is reported to have written medical reports that recommended her undeserving clients to different law firms to be assisted with RAF claims. “RAF is reported to have successfully paid out R510 000 to claimants before discovering some discrepancies in other claims,” Mgolodela said in a statement. She said RAF referred the case to the Hawks for investigation in 2019, which culminated in her a arrest. “The investigation revealed that besides the R510 000 alleged to have been paid to other claimants, RAF nearly ran a potential loss of more than R18 million. “She made her short appearance in court on the day of her arrest, where she was released on R10 000 bail.” The matter was remanded to 28 March for further investigation.
