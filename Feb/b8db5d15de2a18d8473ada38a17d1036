THE community stopped a family from laying their loved one to rest on Saturday, 26 February. The bereaved Nkomazi family from Schoemansdal, Mpumalanga, were blocked by residents demanding the suspects who allegedly killed Nkosana Masibekela last Tuesday, 22 February must be delivered to them. Nkosana (27) was coming from work when community policing forum members allegedly stormed his house to ask him about stolen items. His uncle James Tibane said his nephew told them he was not responsible but he was allegedly assaulted. He said the members didn’t find any stolen goods and wrongfully killed his nephew. He said as they were on their way to the cemetery, the community stopped them and took out the coffin, placing it outside the Schoemansdal cop shop for four hours, after which his nephew was laid to rest. A resident said they did this to show their frustrations about the CPF’s actions. He told Daily Sun this was not the first time they killed the wrong person. “They treat everyone as a thief. They go around assaulting people and even killing them when they are innocent. We want police to act on this because it is unacceptable.” Another resident said if someone was suspected of breaking the law, that person must be taken to the cops. James said they never expected something like this and it was traumatic for the family. “We wanted a dignified funeral for our loved one. The family managed to continue with the burial service without the community.” Colonel Donald Mdluli confirmed five people were bust and charged with murder. They appeared in court last Thursday, 24 February and are out on R500 bail each.
