CAPE Town
Magistrates Court has postponed Zandile Christmas Mafe’s case to next month,
following a request by the state to be afforded more time to conduct
investigations. State
prosecutor advocate Mervyn Menigo told the court that several forensic reports
were still outstanding. He said
since the fire incident last month, some cops had not accessed the National
Assembly for forensic investigations and no reports were available. Menigo said
they wanted two months to conclude. “Our
investigation team is waiting for structural engineers to inform them if the
building is safe for them to start investigation. The team still needs to
finalise Mafe’s cellphone analysis to determine whether there were more people
involved. A final detailed report on the video footage is still outstanding and
analysis of his clothing still needs to be finalised to determine whether there
were any accelerants,” he said. Mafe’s
lawyer advocate Nikiwe Nyathi objected and suggested three weeks for the
investigation to be finalised. Nyathi said
they planned to appeal, at the Western Cape High Court, the decision by the
Magistrates Court to deny Mafe bail. Magistrate
Ronel Oliver postponed the case to 25 March for further investigations. Mafe is
charged with housebreaking with intent to commit terrorism and arson,
terrorism, arson and theft.
