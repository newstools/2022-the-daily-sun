Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler is patching up his squad after the departure of key players during the January transfer window. The club has bolstered its midfielder department by acquiring Cameroon youth international midfielder Brice Ambina. Ambina, who is 20 years old, has signed a deal with the Citizens until end of the 2025-26 season. He’ll become the club’s third signing in the January window after the capture of Mogamat May from Steenberg United and Darwin Gonzalez from Deportivo La Guaira in Venezuela. This comes after City made good money in the transfer window, selling key players such as Abbubaker Mobara to AmaZulu, Abdul Ajagun to Al Hilal in Sudan, Fagrie Lakay to Pyramids in Egypt and Bradley Ralani to Mamelodi Sundowns. Ambina will become the third foreigner in the club as they already have Hugo Marques from Angola and Nathan Idumba from DR Congo. Meanwhile, the club on Monday confirmed that Thami Mkhize has extended his contract until the end of the 2023-24 season. More good news for City is that goalkeeper Darren Keet has resumed full training after suffering a bad injury during the pre-season when he joined the club. That resulted in City signing Marques. The Mother City club will start 2022 with a trip to Durban when they visit Royal AM in the Nedbank Cup last-32 at Chatsworth Stadium on Saturday (3pm). They will then resume their DStv Premiership campaign against Kaizer Chiefs, who they didn’t play in the first round due to Covid-19 having ravaged the Amakhosi camp resulting in Chiefs Naturena Village being closed and the game scheduled for December not being played. The fixture will be played next Tuesday at the DHL Stadium (7.30pm). #DStvPrem AMBINA JOINS CITY?? | Cape Town City announced the signing of Cameroon international midfielder Brice Ambina (20).
