ON Wednesday, 23 February the Mothibistad Regional Court in the Northern Cape sentenced a 27-year-old man to 30 years imprisonment for two counts of rape. According to a statement by police spokesman Captain Olebogeng Tawana, the accused raped a 14-year-old girl on 21 May 2014. “On the day he perpetrated the crime, he had visited the victim’s family. He forced himself on her on two occasions and threatened the victim not to tell anyone about the rape,” said Tawana. Tawana said the victim informed her mother about the rape. During the court proceedings, it emerged that the accused was a close family friend. “The victim’s family did not suspect he could rape or commit any crime against the victim,” said Tawana. The Northern Cape head of Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit Brigadier Nicky Mills applauded Warrant Officer Keitumetse Semetsa, the Department of Justice and the NPA for ensuring the perpetrator was removed from society and put behind bars.
