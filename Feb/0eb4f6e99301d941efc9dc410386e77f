MARUMO Gallants came from behind to beat Chippa United 3-2 in a DStv Premiership match at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Joseph Malongoane scored the most important goal in the 90th minute to take home all three points. It took belief, strength, character, and confidence to overturn the scoreline with just ten minutes before the final whistle. Marumo Gallants started the game on a front foot but their opening goal from Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo in the 30th minute sparked the Chili Boys’ confidence. Gallants weren’t in front for too long as it only took the Chilli Boys seven minutes to level matters when the Chilli Boys caught them on a counter to allow Bienvenu Eva Nga to level the matters before half time. Eva Nga gave the Chilli Boys a lead after nine minutes into the second half but it was all for nothing as his teammates let themselves down again in the last stages of the match. Eva Nga has now scored nine goals for the Chilli Boys this season. Ndlondlo completed a brace by scoring a penalty seven minutes before the final whistle. It looked as if it was going to be another draw from a leading position for the Chilli Boys but Malongoane broke Kurt Lentjies heart in the last minute to take all three points. The Chilli Boys have now dropped points from a winning position in two consecutive games. Many would’ve thought that the Chilli Boys learned from their mistake in the 2 – 2 draw against Royal AM last weekend but it wasn’t the case they dropped points again against Gallants. The Chilli Boys are yet to win a match in 2022.
