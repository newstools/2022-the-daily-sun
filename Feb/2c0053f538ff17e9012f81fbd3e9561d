THE family members of pastor Bheki Hlela (53), who was killed along with his wife Ntombifuthi Hlela (42) and their children Siwinile Nzimande (24) and Siphokazi Hlela (15), are living in fear. The four were gunned down in the Imbali area of Pietermaritzburg on Thursday, 3 February. Apparently, unknown suspects stormed their house around midnight and opened fire. Adding to the tragedy, family member Mthandeni Basi (27) hanged himself the next day. A family member (27) told Daily Sun the attackers broke the doors down and started shooting. He said nothing was stolen. “I got a phone call from a relative. I ran to the house after calling the cops. The cops arrived, went into the main house and came back to tell us all four of them were dead.” ALSO READ | ANC LEADER AND SON SHOT DEAD!
