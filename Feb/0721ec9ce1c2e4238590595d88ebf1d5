NOMVULA Ditupe runs a tavern to put food on the table. But over the weekend, her normally jolly establishment became kak. The sewerage pipes broke at her house in Etwatwa in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, while customers were enjoying their beer on Saturday, 19 February. Patron, Muzi Sibeko (30), said: “Kak and beer don’t mix.”  Nomvula said she was losing a lot of money. She suspects the problem was in a manhole in one of the neighbours’ yards. A number of houses were affected. Bobo Malatjie, a neighbour, said the terrible smell was affecting children. Spokesman for Ekurhuleni city manager Zweli Dlamini said municipal workers will be sent to the area.
