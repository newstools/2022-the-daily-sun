SHE wants to take legal action against the Department of Health, but her hospital file has gone missing. Jabulile Mkhonza from Fernie in Mpumalanga, said Embhuleni Hospital allegedly left her infertile after she had a stillborn in 2017. The mum (38) of two said she had to wait for hours to be attended to, despite medical staff knowing she gave birth via C-section. She said even after telling staff she was in pain, she was allegedly told to wait. “I went to sleep on one of the beds and while I was asleep, something burst in my stomach and the labour pains stopped,” she said Jabulile said she was only attended to the next morning after staff saw she was bleeding. She was taken for surgery and a stillborn baby was delivered. She claimed the placenta was left inside her and she had to be operated on twice. She said doctors told her the baby escaped from the womb and damaged a fallopian tube, which affected her fertility. Jabulile said she was still in pain and couldn’t even perform household chores, and was also forced to leave her job. “I am angry. I cannot work for my children. I am disabled. Even when I get sick, I don’t go to the hospital because of fear,” she said. “I was excited for the baby, but my happiness was cut short. I want to take legal action so the department will stop what they are doing.” Mpumalanga health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said the hospital CEO made sure the file was found. “The hospital has invited the patient to be examined so it can be determined what illness she’s suffering from.”
