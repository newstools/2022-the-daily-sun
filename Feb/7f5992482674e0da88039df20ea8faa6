A TSOTSI was shot dead during a shoot-out with security guards at Thulamahashe Plaza in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Wednesday, 2 February. The drama unfolded when a gang of about six gun-wielding tsotsis stormed Pick n Pay supermarket at the mall. Three of them forced entry into the shop. They threatened to kill shoppers and staff before locking some of them up in the bakery after disarming a guard of his pistol. When they realised the cash office was locked, they fired shots at the door but without success. The gang ran out of the shop but were intercepted by heavily armed guards. Taxi driver Dennis Ubisi (53) was hit in the back and he collapsed near the clothing store. “We were running from the shops. Dennis said he’d been shot in the back and collapsed on the floor,” said his wife Olgah Mahlaule. A guard was shot in the back. Residents and vendors caught up with one tsotsi who was running into bushes. “He was shooting at a guard. We moered him with bottles and stones. His fleeing accomplices in a bakkie fired shots at us so we leave their friend but the guard retaliated, killing him instantly,” said a resident. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed six armed suspects stormed into Pick n Pay supermarket in Thulamahashe after jumping out of a Toyota Hilux GD6 bakkie. He said the suspects were said to have fired some shots at the cash office door but their attempts were unsuccessful. “Further reports indicate security officers from TSB Security Company responded and one suspect was fatally shot. He was found with a pistol next to him.” Police at Mhala were notified. “A case of attempted business robbery was opened with additional charges including two counts of attempted murder and an inquest,” he said.
