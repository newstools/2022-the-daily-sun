BANYANA Banyana have qualified for the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations finals in Morocco having survived a frightening clash against Algeria on Wednesday night.They came from behind to play to a 1-1 draw against Algeria at the Omar Hamadi Stadium in Algiers, adding to the 2-0 first leg win at Orlando Stadium, and qualify on a 3-1 aggregate victory.They joined Morocco, Zambia, Burundi, Uganda, Senegal, Nigeria, Togo, Tunisia, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon in the finals of the tournament that will be hosted by Morocco from 2-23 July.With Banyana qualifying for Awcon, they kept their dreams of qualifying for their second Fifa Women’s World cup alive, as the tournament also doubles as the African qualifiers for the 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup.The top four teams will qualify for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, and two more teams will advance to the inter-confederation play-offs.Banyana had an excellent start to the match last night, getting two quick chances in the 10th and 14th minute of the match, but Hilda Magaia and Linda Motlhalo could not find the back of the net, respectively.Algeria grew confidence in the game, and they found the back of the net in the 26th minute through Naima Bouhani, but her goal was disallowed as it appears that she kicked it from Banyana’s goalie Andile Dlamini’s hands.On the stroke of half-time, Banyana’s defence was caught napping, and Algeria took the lead through Koui Sylla and went to the break leading 1-0.In the second half, Banyana were under pressure, and they went all out for an equaliser which eventually came when Motlhalo converted from a spot-kick after Algeria’s Guellati Sofia handled the ball inside the box.Algeria suffered another blow when their captain Lydia Belkacemi was sent off in the 88th minute after receiving a second yellow card.
