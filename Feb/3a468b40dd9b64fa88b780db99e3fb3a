A man (53) from Alexandra has had five failed marriages because he has a small 4-5. “When you don’t satisfy a woman, they dump you and go look for better sex,” he said. The man said his problem is inherited. “My father had the same problem but our parents stayed together. “I have been to churches, prophets and even to a men’s clinic but nothing has worked.” He said some women have noticed he has a problem and they get into a relationship to milk him. “There’s nothing more hurtful than to see that you can’t satisfy a woman. I don’t feel like a man,” he said. His sister said they were surprised when his marriages failed. “He had beautiful weddings and we celebrated, but three years down the line the marriages fell apart.” “When I sat down with him and asked him why all his women left him, he started crying. “He told me he can’t satisfy a woman and this makes them leave.” The man is appealing for help to grow his 4-5 so he can satisfy women.
