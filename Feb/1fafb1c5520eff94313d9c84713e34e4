UP-AND-COMING rapper, record and sound engineer Musa Nkuna’s hot EP No Sleep is taking Mzansi by storm. The 30-year-old, popularly known as Moose, was born and raised in Malamule outside Giyani, Limpopo. The founder of Hotwave Entertainment began his singing career as a hobby back in 2001. He used to recite poems and his drawing and painting skills paved his way as a civil engineer. Moose started listening to rappers like Mchangani, Prokid and ProVerb, who inspired him to start filling his notepads with lyrics.

I built my PC and started creating beats in 2020. I approached local artists Blackmyth, Ian Reigns, Biggydan, Hlamy C and McCain to listen to my production work, even though I was still a bit behind. “The little money I got, I invested it into my passion. I bought my first condenser microphone and started vocal pre-setting, mixing and mastering. I came out a self-taught sound engineer.” His EP, No Sleep, with classic songs like Mabadi came after working day and night to perfect his writing skills and production. It was tough doing it alone, but he did it. Moose has also worked with a lot of artists. He’s looking forward to his projects Gondzo Ra Vatsonga and Mbilu Ya Musa taking off.
