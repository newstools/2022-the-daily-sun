FOUR North West cops stationed at Coligny were arrested on Tuesday, 1 February in connection with 300 counts of fraud. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani, it is alleged that the cops colluded with petrol attendants between January and December 2020, and defrauded the South African Police Service (SAPS). Funani said the cops used state-owned motor vehicles’ fuel cards to pay for fuel that was never filled in the said vehicles.

She said the cops further arrested two petrol attendants aged between 38 and 58 and they have become state witnesses. “The suspects are expected to appear in the Coligny Magistrates Court on Thursday, 3 February. An investigation into the matter is underway and more arrests are imminent,” Funani added. The Provincial Commissioner of the North West Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena said the arrests will serve as an indication to corrupt cops that management will not tolerate their behaviour and that no criminals will be allowed to wear the blue uniform.
