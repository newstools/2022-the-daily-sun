MUSA Mseleku has lashed out at viewers who feel he has hijacked The Real Housewives of Durban. The reality TV star, presenter and businessman has made two brief appearances in the new season. Viewers complained Musa should not be on the show and should let his wife, Thobile Khumalo shine. Matshezi wrote on Facebook: “Thobile should have thought of introducing herself to the ladies away from being known as a polygamist’s wife.” Blanco wrote: “MaKhumalo and Mseleku should understand this is a different set of people, maybe not the ones they are used to. Speak about polygamy when invited to speak about it or talk about your own life. “Don’t impose it on other people and their relationships.” Tshwane said: “One thing about Musa is he will make sure that he speaks about isthembu every chance he gets.” Musa responded to his critics by saying he was invited to the show.

People must understand the show is an American concept, but we adopted it,” he said. “This means the international community is interested in seeing what we have to offer as Africans. “Polygamy is part of our culture and we cannot pretend it’s not there. “Those criticising it are not being realistic and they are not ready to show their authenticity to the world. They would rather adopt foreign cultures.” Musa said he could have turned down the invitation but he wanted to show another side of African culture. “I think it’s about time that people accept polygamy is here to stay. “A lot of people want to know about it. A significant number of people are actually in polygamous relationships with or without their knowledge.”
