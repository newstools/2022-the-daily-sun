ACTIVIST and media personality Criselda Kananda said she will spend Valentine’s Day remembering Kuli Roberts with friends and family at her home in Kyalami in Joburg. Kuli died on Wednesday, 9 February. Criselda said she will celebrate the life of Kuli, whom she loved deeply. She said the message she wants to give South Africans draws from the message Kuli left the country with that people must love one another genuinely. “We will have a family conversation about love and a small prayer gathering with close friends and family. Each family or friend will bring a dish made with love and explain why that dish is special,” she said. Talking about Valentine’s Day, Criselda said: “I unfortunately believe the day is now too commercialised. People are putting themselves into so much pressure to outsmart each other. Love can easily be expressed through acts of kindness and small gestures.” ALSO READ : THANDISWA SHARES MEMORY OF TATA AND KING OF POP! Meanwhile, Daily Sun visited Kuli’s home in Centurion, Tshwane, on Thursday, 10 February and Friday, 11 February, but no one was home except her gardener, who said he had lost a friend and someone who was friendly. Dan Lebea (54) from Tembisa said Kuli called him uncle and he called her his niece. He said he had known the family for almost four years and that Kuli was a good person. “I was heartbroken when I heard the sad news. We called each other uncle and niece,” he said. Dan said Kuli loved flowers. “I am heartbroken. She didn’t say goodbye. We have known and treated each other like family.” He said he last saw her last week and they greeted each other like always. “Really, I didn’t see anything wrong with her as she was happy and healthy. My last words to her were ‘sawubona mtshana’ and she responded like any normal day with ‘kunjani uncle’,” he said. Dan said he still doesn’t believe he will never see Kuli again. “The flowers in her home will always remind me of her,” he said.
