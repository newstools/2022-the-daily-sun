THE Gqeberha High Court sentenced Dumile Clayton Ndzombana (34) to life imprisonment on Thursday, 17 February, for the murder of Sergeant Miniyaka Kolela from the anti-gang unit. Ndzombana was also handed 15 years for house robbery and eight for illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. According to Captain Yolisa Mgolodela, on 12 August 2020, Kolela and a colleague were patrolling when they noticed a suspicious-looking vehicle that was involved in a house robbery in Kabega Park. “Upon approaching, the suspects alighted and fled from the officers. One of them was armed and fired shots towards cops, fatally wounding Kolela,” Mgolodela said in a statement. She said the suspect was pursued and arrested. Ndzombana was remanded in custody until he was convicted on 15 February, and sentenced. “Provincial head major general Mboiki Obed Ngwenya welcomed the sentence as it will pass a stern message to other criminals who are undermining the role of police officers in the society,” Mgolodela added.
