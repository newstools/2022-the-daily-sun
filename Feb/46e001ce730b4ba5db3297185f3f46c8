CELEBRITY couple Minnie Dlamini and her husband, Quinton Jones, are getting a divorce. The news was confirmed by the couple in a joint statement on Tuesday, 15 February. The couple said although they were divorcing, they would remain friends, business partners and loving parents to their son. For weeks people had been asking why Minnie dropped the Jones surname on her social media accounts. “After months of separation and consultations with our family and a counsellor, we have taken the decision to officially divorce,” read the joint statement. The statement further revealed that as a family, in the past two years, they had experienced incredible joy and devastating loss. “Despite our better efforts to absorb the changes in motion, the emotional burden and the post traumatic distress of our individual loss overweighed our will, hence we’re divorcing,” they said.

In the wake of this news, we ask that you grant us privacy during this difficult time,” the statement concluded. The couple married in a lavish wedding in September 2017 on a wine farm in Somerset West. Their journey of saying “I do” was documented in a three-part docu-series, Becoming Mrs Jones, which played on Vuzu Amp.
