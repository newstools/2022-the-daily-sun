An Eastern
Cape schoolboy who had just witnessed his father being stabbed to death by a
suspected street robber, took a firearm from his lifeless body before allegedly
shooting dead the suspect. Komani
police have now opened an inquest and a case of murder for investigation. The
incident took place in front of a horrified crowd near the bustling Hewu taxi
rank in downtown Komani on Wednesday. Komani
police spokesperson Captain Namhla Mdleleni said three suspects robbed the
pupil of his cellphone and clothing while he was on his way home from school
earlier in the day. Mdleleni
said that he quickly reported the incident to his father, who joined his son in
searching for the suspects. "[The]
suspects were allegedly identified and one allegedly advanced to them stabbing
the father to death," said Mdleleni. "The
(pupil) allegedly drew a firearm from his father, shot the suspect and [the
suspect] also died on the scene." Mdleleni
could not reveal further details about the incident. In
September 2017, a Komani woman made international headlines after stabbing her
daughter's three alleged rapists, killing one of them. The
56-year-old, dubbed lion mama, was hailed a hero for rescuing her daughters
from the alleged criminals. She was
arrested, but walked out of Lady Frere Magistrate's Court a free woman after
the National Prosecuting Authority opted not to press charges against her
following overwhelming public petitions for her release. Lion Mama
had heard from locals how three men were raping her daughter at an abandoned
house on 2 September. She grabbed
a dagger and proceeded to the house where she embarked on a stabbing spree
after catching them in the act. The
incident happened at Zwartwater near Komani. SOURCE:
