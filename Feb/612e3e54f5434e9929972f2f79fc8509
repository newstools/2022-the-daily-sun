LUVUYO Memela’s cheeky back-heeled winning goal for AmaZulu to help beat Horoya AC 1-0 in their Caf Champions League group stage match last Friday, has seen him named in the Team of the Week by the Confederation of African Football (Caf). Mamelodi Sundowns defender Brian Onyango was also named in Caf’s Team of the Week after he nullified the threat against Sudanese side Al Merrikh as Sundowns came away with a goalless draw last Saturday in their group match played in Egypt. Memela, who was central to everything good for Usuthu as the Durban-based side won their first Champions League group stage game. This means Memela, who joined Usuthu at the beginning of last season from Orlando Pirates, entered himself into the club’s history books to become the first player to score in the Champions League group stage. Coach Benni McCarthy spoke glowingly of Memela’s performance after the game. The win saw Usuthu move to second in Group B behind Moroccan giants Raja Casablanca, who have collected all six points after winning both matches. Last season’s Caf Confederation Cup winners started the group stage by beating Usuthu 1-0 two weeks ago. Usuthu and McCarthy are hoping Memela continues where he left it off when AmaZulu host ES Setif of Tunisia at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday. Sundowns will again rely on Kenyan international Onyango when they face Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly at Cairo International Stadium on Saturday.
