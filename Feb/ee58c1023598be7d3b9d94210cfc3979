SESHEGO police in Limpopo have launched a manhunt for a heavily armed gang after a taxi boss was gunned down. Solly Ledwaba, the former chairman of Seshego, Polokwane, Taxi Associations was killed in a hail of bullets in a drive-by shooting. The shocking incident happened along the Khensani Drive near Seshego Circle Centre at about 5.30pm on Sunday, 30 January. Ledwaba’s bullet-riddled body was found inside his charcoal Toyota Aygo. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they were requesting information from the public to assist in arresting the unknown gunmen. “The police’s preliminary investigations revealed that the assailants were driving in a white Toyota Fortuner without registration numbers, and shot several times before fleeing the scene. The motive behind incident is not known at this stage, but taxi violence cannot be ruled out,” said Mojapelo. Speaking on Thobela FM’s Hlokwa la Tsela, Takalani Nemaungane of Seshego, Polokwane, Taxi Association said they had just finished electing the new leadership of their association on Sunday and they were all left shocked when they received news that Ledwaba has been shot and killed. “Ledwaba was a very peaceful person and discouraged divisions in our association. He was a true leader,” said Nemaungane.
