THE man, sitting with his three friends, called a woman passing by to come over. The 33-year-old woman responded: “You are not my type. Why should I come to you?” And she almost got killed. Suddenly, the man became furious. He rushed to her and while they were arguing, he allegedly pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot her. He told her he would kill her so she would not have her type of man. His friends rushed over and pleaded with him not to kill her. “I never thought I would get into trouble for telling the truth. I was being honest. We can’t just date for the sake of dating,” said the woman, who believed the man had anger issues.
