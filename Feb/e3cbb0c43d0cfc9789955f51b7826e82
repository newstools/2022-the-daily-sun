SWALLOWS FC might be sitting perilously close to the bottom of the DStv Premiership table at the moment, but coach Dylan Kerr insists there’s no need to panic, just yet. Kerr, who has become somewhat of a relegation battle specialist in the Mzansi top-flight, is confident that he can perform another rescue act. The 55-year-old mentor has previously saved former teams Black Leopards, Baroka and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) from the jaws of relegation. And this season, he will be required to do the same with the Dube Birds who are currently one of the favourites for the dreaded drop. Kerr’s Swallows suffered their ninth defeat of the season at the hands of TS Galaxy on Saturday. The Maltese-born tactician, however, insists that he has too much quality in his team to be relegated. He has 10 games to inspire a turnaround: “I have been in this situation before... and done okay. “It was actually worse with the other three teams because they weren’t of the quality of Swallows. “But on the other hand, the team spirit, camaraderie and togetherness of those teams were saved. “I have seen a great team spirit, work ethic and philosophy of football played in our last few games. “We have to go back to the drawing board, get the team ready for our next challenge.” Swallows’ 10-match mission to save their skin begins against Sekhukhune United next weekend at Ellis Park Stadium. The Dube Birds lost 1-0 to Babina Noko in their first meeting earlier this season and will be looking to settle the score. Although Kerr is calm in the face of the challenge that lies ahead for his team, he is under no illusion about how difficult it will be to save the Dube Birds from relegation. He insists all their remaining ten matches are cup finals and they will be approached as such.
