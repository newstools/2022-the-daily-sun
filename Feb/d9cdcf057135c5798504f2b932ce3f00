LIKOENA of Lesotho have appointed former Bloemfontein Celtic coach, Veselin Jelusic, on a two-year deal to replace Thabo Senong. The 62-year-old, who has been working in Africa since 1992, coaching in countries such as Angola, Botswana, South Africa and Zambia, was among over 100 coaches who applied for the vacant coaching job, according to the Lesotho FA. “It is my great honour and pleasure to be chosen to be the coach of the Lesotho national team. I would like to give my promise that I will do my best to contribute to the achievements and goals of the Lesotho Football Association,” said the Serbian-born coach. “I know the country has limitations in terms of players playing in professional leagues, as we get to play against top countries in the Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualifiers, but that does not matter, we will always give it our best to make the country proud.” Jelusic was the coach of Celtic in the 2017-18 season, taking them to the Telkom Knockout final but lost to Bidvest Wits when Vincent Pule cheekily back-heeled the winning goal in Durban. Celtic management then decided to let him go at the end of that season, having been in charge of 37 games in all competitions – winning 13, losing 13 and drawing 11. Jelusic’s first match in charge of Likoena will be a crucial two-legged play-off tie against Seychelles next month and the winner will qualify for the group phase of the 2023 Afcon qualifiers. Leslie Notsi, their technical director, was momentarily holding the fort since Senong’s departure. Meanwhile, the association has been barred by Caf from playing home matches at Maseru’s Setsoto Stadium after it was declared unfit to host the second leg of their tie against the Seychelles. But they have arranged with Safa to play the match at Dobsonville Stadium in Soweto. The group stages of the Afcon qualifiers are set to start in June, with the Afcon finals taking place in June next year in Ivory Coast.
