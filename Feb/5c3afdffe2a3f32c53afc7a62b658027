SOME people don’t want to age and will do just about anything to stay young. A new research has found that the blood of the young could help rejuvenate the aging muscle, in effect keeping the body young. The new study, published on a scientific journal Nature Aging, found that particles in mouse blood called extracellular vesicles, or EVs, deliver genetic instructions for the longevity protein called “Klotho” to muscle cells. The researchers found that while mice age, with their muscle functions weakening, cognition declining, and ability to repair muscle slowing down, EVs also becomes weaker. When the older mice were transfused with the blood of younger mice, their cells and tissues took on more youthful features including the ability to regenerate muscle. But these effects faded when the EVs were removed from the blood. According to the report, these findings could help advance the understanding as to why the ability of our muscles to regenerate diminishes with age. “We’re really excited about this research for a couple of reasons,” said the study’s senior author Fabrisia Ambrosio, an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.
