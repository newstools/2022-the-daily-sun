SIYA Kolisi’s triumphs on the rugby field inspired a Gqeberha artist to pen a song paying tribute to the Springbok captain. While Siya scooped Mzansi’s 2021 rugby player of the year award, a new kwaito hit celebrating the Gqeberha-born star’s rugby achievements is making waves on dance floors. Masixole “Mara” Gwebani, the kwaito artist behind the hit, told SunBuzz he was paying tribute to his homeboy. Mara said the song off his latest album Afrika has been on high rotation on radio stations since its release and he was shocked by the positive response from his fans.

That was my inspiration.” Mara, who rose to fame through his hit Akhomntu Wamntu Apha, said Siya gave hope to many youngsters not only on the dusty streets of Zwide, where the rugby star hails from, but in Mzansi’s poorest communities. He said many youngsters developed a passion for rugby because of Siya and were eager to follow in his footsteps. “His rags-to-riches story is an inspiration that nothing is impossible. No matter where you come from, you are capable of achieving great things. What I admire about Siya is fame and fortune haven’t changed him. He remains humble despite all his success and hasn’t forgotten Gqeberha,”said Mara. He worked on the album with Zain SA, KG Zibula, Pilato, Athi Capone, CJ Soul, DJ Jaymo, Cenfire and Magentic Deejays. He’d like to meet up with Siya and cook a new hit with him in studio.
