PARENTS have been camping outside Phelindaba Secondary School since Monday, 21 February. They said they received a message on Thursday, saying some pupils were acting as if they were possessed once inside the premises in Atteridgeville, Tshwane. One parent said children were sent home by teachers. “We were called to come fetch our kids because the number of those having the episodes moved from eight to over 50 pupils.” She claimed when they got to the school, the kids seemed like they were possessed by an evil spirit. She said they prayed and managed to calm them down. A 39-year-old parent said her child was one of those ‘possessed’. And when she tried to calm her down, she fought with her. “She was so strong it was difficult to control her. It seemed as if all pupils were saying there was a snake that wanted to consume them. It looks as if someone wants to use our kids for their evil deeds.” Parents believed this was because teachers were fighting for the principal position. On Monday when parents decided to camp at the school, the kids started acting strangely. Another parent said they would come to school every day so they could pray for the kids. Pastor Andrew Matsha (44) believed some people were performing evil deeds at the school, and it was affecting the pupils. “We must have a day of prayer with all the parents,” he said. The Department of Education said it was aware of the incidents and officials were at the school. Spokesman Steve Mabona said affected pupils were returned home and a parents’ meeting was held last Sunday. “A resolution was taken to provide the necessary counselling and support to affected pupils and school community at the meeting,” he said.
