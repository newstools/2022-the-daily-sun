AL AHLY coach Pitso Mosimane was left pleasantly surprised to see his make-shift side overcome CF Monterrey 1-0 in the Fifa Club World Cup being staged in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. Mosimane was without a number of key players due to injuries and others still participating in the Africa Cup of Nations final in Cameroon. It was sweet revenge for Ahly as the Mexican giants, coached by former Egypt coach Jarvier Aguirre, had beaten Egyptians in the past two matches in the same competition. “The kind of players they have and the players they buy. Their budget is maybe 10 times ours,” said Mosimane via Fifa. “We played under difficult conditions, missing seven starting players. Then we lost two players with injuries. We had to adjust. My main analyst, who is the guy who dissects the teams we play against, was down with Covid and I was down with Covid too,” added Mosimane who tested positive prior to the game but was tested again and the results were negative. Ahly will now face Brazilian side and Copa Libertadores champions Palmeiras in the semifinal at Al Nahyan Stadium tomorrow. It will be the second time these sides meet in this competition after clashing last year in the third place play-off with Ahly won on a penalty shootout. It is likely Mosimane will again be without his seven Egyptian internationals who played Senegal in the Afcon final last night. But Mosimane is eager to get the better of the South American champions and help Ahly reach the final and become the second African club to do so after TP Mazembe in 2010. “I think it will be a tactical match. They have won the Libertadores twice in a row and they are a big team but we are not afraid of anyone,” said Mosimane via Kingfut.
