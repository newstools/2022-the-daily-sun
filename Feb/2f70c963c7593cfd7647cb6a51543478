PUPILS from Spa Park Primary School in Bela-Bela, Limpopo have received new mobile classrooms and temporary toilets. Premier Stan Mathabatha visited the school, which has grades 1 to 9, on Wednesday, 26 January and intervened. Mathabatha, who was accompanied by MEC for Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure Dickson Masemola, said he had to urgently intervene to ensure pupils learn in a conducive environment. Mathabatha, who did an inspection of the facility after meeting the school management, said it was evident that the school premises were not suitable.  “This is why I ordered the departments of education, provincial treasury and public works, roads and infrastructure to complete the process of giving the school an electronic management information system that would allow them to construct the required high school on land that has already been identified,” he said. Spa Park Primary School has 1 781 pupils with just over 40 teachers. They have eight vacant posts that are being advertised. Regarding the situation at the school, the Limpopo education department said meetings have been held with various school stakeholders to address matters that were raised. Mathabatha said an ideal situation is that no school should have a temporary classroom for more than a year.
