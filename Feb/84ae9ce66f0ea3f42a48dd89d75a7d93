PEOPLE are always looking for more money. But Digital Bones’ sangoma Nzama Maluleke has warned people against ukuthwala. This after a SunReader wanted to find out about the dangers of ukuthwala. Nzama said desperate people had approached him on many occasions begging him to help them with ukuthwala, but he refused as his calling is to help and not cause harm. “I’m guided by my ancestors and tell my thwasas to do the same thing. “Whoever chooses to help people with ukuthwala, I tell them not in my premises,” said Nzama. His former thwasa, sangoma Girly Chavalala, known as Mahlebezulu, said Nzama never taught them or introduced them to ukuthwala. Nzama said ukuthwala affected innocent people. He said: “Ukuthwala had deadly consequences as in the beginning, it appears as fruitful but its never-ending demands aren’t worth it.” He said very often the accumulated wealth rapidly disappears.
