BUSINESSMAN Lekau Sehoana has opened up about why he stopped drinking. He said a lot of people ask him why he doesn’t drink alcohol, so he posted photos of himself years ago when he was 21 and lying on the floor. Lekau said he was drunk in those photos becauuse he used to drink a lot. “A lot of people ask me why I don’t drink alcohol, I used to. A lot even. This is a picture of me at 21 years of age. Drunkard, poverty-stricken and hopeless. But a lover of fashion and the pop culture, I was able to turn my life around,” he captioned the photos. People commented and congratulated him on taking the decision to quit alcohol. Mcedise commented on Twitter: “Damn! Salute my brother. Looking at where you are today, I feel like you’ve made it. But that’s up to you to decide. Congratulations on all the good work!” ALSO READ : HUNGANI AND STEPHANIE: MARRIAGE’S NO WALK IN PARK! Rabimanamela asked him to make a documentary about his life. “Think we need a documentary, king. Give us insight into your life and then the journey to the success of Drip,” he wrote. Wrote Leon Fibonacci: “People don’t understand how much being an alcoholic can deny you an opportunity to become the best version of yourself. Hundred points symbol. If I never stopped drinking and partying every weekend, I wouldn’t be the person I am now. I may not be where I want to be, but I’m not where I used to be.” Margaret Ngwenya said she hopes Lekau’s story inspired other young people. “How I wish most people, especially young peeps, would admit alcohol is a problem instead of defending it. This story needs to be spread #TheDripStory,” she said. A lot of people ask me why I don’t Drink Alcohol, I used to. A lot even. This is a Picture of me at 21 Years of Age. Drunkard, poverty striken and hopeless. But a lover of Fashion and the pop-culture. I was able to turn my life around. #TheDripStory pic.twitter.com/fzYIo3SfmB
