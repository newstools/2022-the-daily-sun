Izangoma and members of various churches gathered on Sunday, 20 February, to discuss spiritual matters. They met at Guga S’thebe Hall in Langa, Cape Town, to discuss the challenges they faced. The event, which was called Indibano Yobizo, was organised by Rashieda Mali, who is a sangoma but used to be a religious Christian. She told Daily Sun there was confusion because some people thought people who had the calling were possessed by demons. “This event is meant to clarify and help people understand it’s a calling from the ancestors and not a demon. Being a sangoma is a gift from God and whatever you do is done by God through your ancestors,” she said. Born-again Christian Zonke Mlalandle said people needed to stop judging each other because of their religion.  “Judging is for God. If you are a sangoma and I’m a Christian, it doesn’t mean I’m better than you. “We must not undermine each other,” she said. Luyolo Lengisi-Hawule (23) of African Young Indigenous Leaders said izangoma were undermined in every area of life. He said: “From workplaces and schools to churches, izangoma are not respected and we are forced to fight for our rights.” Rashieda told the SunTeam she hoped to continue hosting events such as this so people understood different beliefs. Mbuyiselo Kanzi, one of the speakers, said: “I’m a Christian who comes from a traditional background. What I don’t like is that there are now izangoma taking people for a ride and not helping them.”
