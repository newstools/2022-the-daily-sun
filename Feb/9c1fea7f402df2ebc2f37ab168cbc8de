The club has also released members of the technical staff Ditheko Mototo, Simon Gopane and Kgosi Molokwane. According to the club’s statement released by CEO Sinky Mnisi on Tuesday, management took the decision to trim the team to a manageable size to avoid having financial crisis in future. Read the statement: “As a team we have taken a cautious decision to trim the team to a manageable size having taken into consideration the financial implications thereof. Though, it was sad to part ways, but in the best interest of the team and players, we had to down size. We would like to wish all the players and technical staff well in their new teams, and thank them for having served us well.” The club has showed support to coach John Maduka by strengthening key areas ahead of the resumption of DStv Premiership. The seventh placed Royal AM will take on fellow rookies Sekhukhune United at Chatsworth Stadium on 15 February. However, they will first channel their focus on their Nedbank Cup last 32 round match against Cape Town City on 12 February. “We have also signed new players as part of our efforts to stabilize the team strategically in certain positions. We welcome our new signees and hope they will add value in our team.”
