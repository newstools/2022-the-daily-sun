When the New Year is ushered in, most people feel the need
to make resolutions and “fix” what they feel is wrong in their lives. But soon,
these resolutions are forgotten, and old habits are started again. However, one
resolution that is growing in popularity and should be actively committed to is
the desire to lessen our environmental footprint. “And given the state of the
environment, this is a resolution that shouldn’t be overlooked, or given up on
that quickly. It’s something that the entire family can pursue” comments
Bronwyn Ragavan, brand manager for laundry product brand, Personal Touch. Ragavan feels that for a family to become environmentally
conscious it needs to start at home. Putting environmental measures into place
will eventually spill over into each family member’s individual lives, and this
will further have a positive impact on the environment. Ragavan suggests trying out the following tips to create a
greener home: “Making the change to a product such as Personal Touch
Washing Powder Sheets is a step in the right direction. Using products that
still deliver exceptional quality while lessening your impact on the
environment, provides you with peace of mind that you are doing your part,”
comments Ragavan.
