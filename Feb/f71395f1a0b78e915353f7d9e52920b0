AWARD-WINNING producer Gift “pH Raw X” Nkuna has opened up about being broke. The media personality, who used to work at Mzansi’s biggest radio stations, shared that he had been broke for most of his career. “I’ve lived hand-to-mouth. I left everything I had going for me to be in the music industry and ever since then, I’ve lost my home, car and family. I’m a broke artist, producer and broken man. Every year for the last seven years, I’ve worked hard for change but remained broke,” he said.

I hide it well; a delusion. “Over the years, I’ve borrowed too much money just to maintain my broke. Some I even forgot I owe money because as soon I have it, I need another loan.” The producer shared that although he was going through a lot, he had hope that things would get better. “There is a God and for some reason, He has kept me longer than I had expected to be here. Broke as I am, I still have so much more to give.” A post shared by GroovyP (@ph_rawx)
