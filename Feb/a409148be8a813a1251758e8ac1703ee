MAMELODI Sundowns newly signed Bolivian international midfielder Erwin Saavedra finally arrived in the country on Tuesday to start his career in the PSL. Sundowns coach Rhulani Mokwena revealed that Saavedra’s acquisition doesn’t only benefit his club, but also helps increase the standard of football in the league. The 25-year-old, who signed a two-and-half year deal is expected to start training with the defending DStv Premiership champions on Thursday. Said Mokwena: “Yes, we are excited about the profile of a very good player that comes into a very good team. We are looking forward to inducting him into work that we do. Saavedra, as you all know, played for Bolivia in the qualifiers on Tuesday (last week). He then had to work to get the necessary travel documents, including Covid tests. But pulling such type of player speaks where we are as a club. This is not just big for Mamelodi Sundowns, it's big for South African football, because if you can bring this type of profile of player, the bigger beneficiaries are the South African public.” Mokwena could not divulge whether Saavedra will play in their Caf Champions League Group A opener against Sudanese side Al-Hilal Omdurman at Rustenburg’s Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Friday or not. “He left Bolivia on Sunday, went to Peru and then to the Netherlands, so you are talking about 20 hours travelling to South Africa. When we resume training on Wednesday he would have arrived. We will work in terms of all the other medical procedures that needs to be done and familiarise him with our training, squad, and processes regarding our preparation, hopefully we can incorporate him into the match day as soon as possible.”
