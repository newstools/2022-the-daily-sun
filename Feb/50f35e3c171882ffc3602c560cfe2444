NEWCOMERS Venda Football Academy (VFA) have enjoyed a dream start to life in the GladAfrica Championship with promotion within their reach. They are currently third with 32 points after 19 matches. Two points separate them and the top two teams, Richard Bay and JDR Stars who are equal on 34 points. But the Championship rookies face their moment of truth as regards their promotion hopes when they host Bay at their Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). After Bay, VFA host JDR Stars the following weekend at their Thohoyandou stronghold. Nene stressed they can’t afford to drop points against the two log leaders. The VFA skipper said the next two games are both must-win games. “We approach these by wanting to win at all costs because if they beat us, they’re five points clear from us and it’s going to be difficult to catch up but if we beat them, we are on track,” he said. Nene admitted a place in the promotion play-offs or automatic promotion to the PSL would be an over achievement.  Nene thinks that surviving the first season in the Championship and maintaining their status might have been something that the players had in mind when the season started. Nene added they changed their objectives from wanting to survive to seeking promotion as the season progressed. He said this is the result of a combination of good management from the coaches and the quality players they have. “Everybody is coming to the party and I think that is why we’ve been able to compete this season,” Nene said.
