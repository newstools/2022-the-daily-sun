 TS Sporting defender, Rooi Mahamutsa has praised the leadership of his coach and ex Orlando Pirates teammate, Benson Mhlongo, stating that he has been a great leader since his playing days and Sporting will achieve great things with him in charge. He said Sporting is a team full of quality players and with the leadership of Mhlongo they can only go up after three games when the GladAfrica Championship resumes this Saturday. “Watch the space, after three of five games you will see TS Sporting move up the log standings because of the work he does and his ethics as well,” said Mahamutsa. He expressed a sense of confidence in Mhlongo’s leadership as they look to move up from position 14 on the log to a much safer place. “I'm confident that he will take this team to a different level,” said Mahamutsa. He described him as a player-coach, a leader, and a fighter who likes to take charge on the pitch. “That’s why I have learned a lot from him. He was a coach on the field while we had a coach outside,” said Mahamutsa. He added: “He would lift you if you were down and seeing that your game is down. He knew his teammates. He has been a leader since he began playing football, even now as a coach he remains a great leader.” Mahamutsa plans to work hard and not relax because he knows that Mhlongo demands hard work from his team.
