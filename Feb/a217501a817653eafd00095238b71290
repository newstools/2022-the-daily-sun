The Hawks on Friday arrested a 43-year-old former police reservist at his home in Leslie, Mpumalanga. A stolen firearm, a police uniform and drugs, with an estimated street value of R500 000, were found at his home. The firearm found inside his house was allegedly stolen in 2010 at Leslie police station, when the man was still a police reservist. Hawks provincial spokesperson in Mpumalanga, Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, said the man faced charges of illegal possession of a firearm and police uniform, as well as trafficking drugs. He is expected to appear in the Leslie Magistrate's Court on Monday.
