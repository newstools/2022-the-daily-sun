THE Hawks recently arrested six suspects in Joburg and recovered an AK 47 rifle, two pistols, ammunition as well as two hijacked vehicles. According to Colonel Katlego Mogale, the cops were searching for the suspects involved in armed robberies in Joburg, using a white Kia minibus. Mogale said they received information that the suspects were on their way to commit a robbery in the Joburg CBD. “They were spotted on the M2 highway and the team attempted to stop them. A shoot-out ensued and the suspects’ vehicle crashed into other vehicles as they tried to flee. Three suspects were immediately arrested,” said Mogale in a statement. She said the fourth suspect attempted to escape by hijacking a Toyota bakkie while the fifth suspect hid in the bushes. “They were both arrested. Information was followed on the sixth suspect, who was arrested in a manhole in the CBD. Five of the suspects sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to hospital and placed under police guard. The investigation revealed that the suspects’ vehicle was hijacked in Heidelberg last month,” said Mogale. She said the suspects will be charged with attempted murder, hijacking, illegal possession of firearms and ammunition as well as possession of stolen vehicles. They are expected to appear in court soon.
