LOYISO Basso spent eight months in prison after he was arrested in 2006 for attempted murder and possession of an illegal firearm. But in 2008, the 33-year-old from Khayelitsha in Cape Town decided to stop terrorising the community. “Living a life of crime is not easy. I am grateful to God I managed to leave that life,” he said. In 2017, Loyiso started a restaurant called KwaMgoli, where he sold meat, chakalaka and pap. But this didn’t do well, so Loyiso tried to sell umleqwa, steamed bread and amagwinya, which also didn’t succeed. So in 2018, he started to sell kotas, which he said was the best decision ever. His kotas start from R15 for a kota with polony, chips and cheese and go up to R30 for a kota with eggs, russian and double cheese. He has two employees. One of his employees, Daluxolo Nkonyana (29) thanked Loyiso for saving him. He said he robbed people before he worked at KwaMgoli. “It was not easy to quit that life, but having someone like Loyiso motivated me. I wake up every morning just like everyone else and go to work. I do not rob people of their hard-earned cash and I am proud of my decision,” he said. A resident said it was hard to believe that Loyiso had quit his life of crime. “We have been supporting him and can see he was telling the truth when he said he stopped that life. We are also happy he is helping other criminals change their lives,” said a resident.
