AS President Cyril Ramaphosa prepares to deliver the State of the Nation Address on Thursday, 10 February, many people have expectations of what he will touch on. The SunTeam caught up with some citizens to hear what they were expecting from the address. Pule Mathibe (40) said as an unemployed man, he was hoping the president focused more on creating jobs. He said a lot of things had been said in the past where big money was mentioned to change lives, but nothing ever happened. “I am a hustler and don’t have a stable job. I would like to hear the president talk about how he will fight this high rate of unemployment because we are suffering. The R350 grant is not enough to take care of someone,” he said. “We don’t want empty promises. We want the government to deliver on its promises as it promised us heaven and earth when campaigning for votes.” Pule said a lot of money budgeted to address issues in the country went to the wrong hands, and those who were guilty were never punished.  Zane Moutloane (34) said he was running a chicken dust business but struggling. “I would like to see my business grow because I have a family to feed. The government should consider street businesses so we can also be uplifted,” he said. Gogo Mariah Malele (71) said the government should prioritise the needs of the elderly. She said they were struggling while also taking care of their grandkids. “I hope our grant is increased as we have a lot to do – not only for ourselves, but for our families too,” said gogo Mariah.
