AFTER Big Nuz member Sibusiso “R Mashesha” Khomo died in 2015, the popular kwaito group made headlines for all the wrong reasons. The split and hate between remaining members Mampintsha and Danger were reported. But now, the group that got everyone thinking it had perished is making a comeback, according to Mampintsha and Danger, currently in studio recording music with DJ Tira. Danger has always maintained that Big Nuz was not dead, although the signs of splitting were visible. Talking about their return, he said they were going back to their roots. “We are in studio because people have always demanded our return. So, we are returning by popular demand,” said Danger, whose real name is Mzi Tshomela. He said they were recording DJ Tira’s song, featuring Big Nuz. “Then we will record our album as a group. Big Nuz will never end. I’m sure our brother R Mashesha is watching over us,” he said.

Mampintsha was not available for comment, but his manager Sbu Ncube confirmed that the group was in studio. “The group is returning. Mampintsha is committed because he loves music and since Big Nuz introduced him and launched his career, he will never turn his back on it,” said Sbu. Big Nuz was formed in 2002 and popularly known for producing hits. And, Danger said they would stick to the original sound the group was known for.
