POLICE Minister Bheki Cele is expected in the hot seat as the second leg of the South African Human Rights Commission’s investigation into the 2021 July unrest kicks off in Joburg on Monday, 21 February. The first
leg took place in KZN where the violence had initially started. Some
high-profile police officers gave evidence during the commission’s hearings. The
hearings in Joburg will be held for the next two weeks. Today the
police minister is expected to outline the police’s reaction to the impending
threats of the violence and also the part the law enforcement played during
riots. The riots
last year brought the country’s economy to the brink of collapse, with over 300
people killed during that period. The riots
broke out firstly in KZN and spread to Gauteng where businesses were looted and
some key infrastructure damaged. Several
people were arrested for having instigated the violence which spiraled out of
control in the two affected provinces. Former Ukozi
DJ Ngizwe Mcunu and student leader Bonginkosi Khanyile are some of those who
appeared in court for the alleged instigation of the violence.
