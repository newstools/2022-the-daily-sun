A 45-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly
impersonating a police officer in the Johannesburg CBD on Sunday and demanding
money from foreign nationals. Three more people who are believed to be the
woman's accomplices managed to flee and are still at large. According to Johannesburg Police spokesperson
Captain Xoli Mbele, four people posing as police officers stopped two women at
the corner of Bree and Von Wielligh Street around 14:00 on Sunday. He said the suspects showed the victims fake police
appointment cards and demanded that they hand over their passports. He said: When the victims failed to produce their passports,
the suspects proceeded to threaten the victims with an arrest if each victim
failed to produce an amount of R500. At that time, said Mbele, the victims only had
R100. "When they told the bogus police that, the
suspects told the victims they were under arrest," said Mbele. Police on duty received a tip from a community
member about bogus police who were robbing people and rushed to the scene. Mbele said: The victims were rescued and among the bogus
police, three escaped and one was apprehended. The suspect was found with a fake appointment
certificate. "In such cases, suspects would cover up normal
bank cards in white, and add photos of themselves with the South African Police
Service (SAPS) emblem which can easily be downloaded online. Suspects can then
easily get away with serious crimes while the image of the police is tarnished
in the community," said Mbele. Investigations are underway and the suspect was due
to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Monday. Never miss a story. Choose from our range of
