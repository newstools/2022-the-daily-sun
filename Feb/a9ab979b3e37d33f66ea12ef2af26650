WITH the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine became an autonomous state. Residents voted for independence and the country adopted its constitution in 1996. In 2000, Ukraine was plunged into crisis when pro-Russian president Leonid Kuchma was caught on tape ordering the kidnapping of a journalist. The USA became more involved in 2002 when it was allegedly revealed that a defence system was transferred to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. This soured relations between the west and Kuchma, and he began leaning towards Russia. During elections in 2004, Kuchma did not run and pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych won. However, pro-Western candidate Viktor Yushchenko cried foul. Following protests, the election was declared null and void. After a run-off, Yushchenko won. In 2010, Yanukovych returned to power. morning guysthis is Kyiv - capital of ukraine, at nightrussian military attacked innocent people and they will probably keep attacking the city pic.twitter.com/mbJBfpUwdN  In November 2013, Yanukovych did not sign the Ukraine–European Union Association agreement.

In 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky became president and now sits with the headache of a Russian invasion.
