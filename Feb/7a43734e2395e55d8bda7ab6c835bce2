IT HAS been six months since the Bel-Air estate owned by Osama bin Laden’s brother, Ibrahim bin Laden, was listed for $28 million (about R430 million). And so far, despite its prime location within walking distance from the famed Hotel Bel-Air, there have been no takers. The New York Post reports that the seven-bedroom and five-bathroom abandoned estate received a price cut of $2 million (about R30 million) in January. A post shared by Zillow Gone Wild ?? (@zillowgonewild)  Ibrahim, who has owned the property for nearly four decades since 1983, abandoned it following the September 11 attacks. Spanning over 650 square metres, he had lived there with his former wife, Christine Hartunian Sinay, a Los Angeles socialite with whom he shares daughter Sibba Hartunian. The two purchased the Mediterranean villa-style mansion for $R1 million at the time. While photos of the home show a pink concrete exterior, interior photos are scarce due to its deteriorating state. The windows have been boarded up to ward off vandals. Any potential buyers will not only have to plunk down a hefty amount for the home, but millions more for renovations.
