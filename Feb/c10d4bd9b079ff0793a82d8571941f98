FOLLOWING the death of award-winning rapper Rikhado “Riky Rick” Makhado, who allegedly died by suicide, the importance of mental health has been on the tongues of many local celebrities. Many of them have been sharing that the constant bullying they were receiving from the public sometimes pushed them to a dark space. A few days earlier, Riky became the talk of the town after he posted a video where he was dancing with his wife. He received a lot of backlash from social media users, claiming she looked unhappy. He even had to defend himself by sharing that his wife was camera shy. Fellow rapper Big Zulu, who could not control his tears, described Riky as compassionate, also sharing that his death came with a big lesson. “It is painful, and I feel like other people don’t love us the way we think they do,” he said.

And, I’m still not sure how I survived and overcame them. Mainly, it’s knowing that people who say hurtful things are usually in a darker place where no one matters, including themselves.” Then TV presenter Shamiso Mosaka said people did not understand the depth of mental breakdown that bullying on social media could cause. “Whether someone has been depressed for a while or not, Twitter and the impact on one’s mental health or how much it can tip the scales shouldn’t be taken lightly. This app can really take you into a bad place. I know this.” She further said depression did not have a cure. It just needed to be constantly managed and when one is trying to do so, they don’t need the extra noise. Media personality Minnie Dlamini, who recently announced her divorce that led to bullying on social media, shared that this incident could have easily been her.
