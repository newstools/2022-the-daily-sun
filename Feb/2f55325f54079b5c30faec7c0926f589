AMAZULU suffered a 1-0 defeat in their Caf Champions League group opening match against Moroccan giants Raja Casablanca at Mohamed V Stadium on Saturday night. After holding last season’s Confederation Cup champions in the first half to a goalless, Raja finally made their superiority of possession count, with Mohsin Moutouali’s shot slipping through the legs of Veli Mothwa in the 67th minute. Usuthu looked tired when the goal came, with Zakaria EL Wandi playing a give and go with Moutouali before the latter found the net. This means AmaZulu, in their maiden campaign in the Champions League group stages, are bottom of Group B after the first game. They are pointless just like Guinean side Horoya, who lost with the same score line to ES Setif. Benni McCarthy’s men will host Horoya in Durban on Friday next week, where they will have to pick up their first win in the Champions League to give themselves a chance of knockout stages. Usuthu, despite the loss, should be proud of themselves. They put up a strong showing against a side coached by former Belgium and Ivory Coast coach Marc Wilmots, who thumped Orlando Pirates 4-0 at the same venue in the quarter final in the Confed Cup second leg (5-1 on aggregate) before they went on to win it. They lost the Caf Super Cup to Pitso Mosimane’ s Al Ahly. Raja was dominant in the second tier tournament last term, winning all six group stage matches, scoring 13 times without conceding a goal. But on this occasion, they were given a sterner test by the Usuthu side, who were unlucky not to have scored. They hit the post through captain Makhehleni Makhaula just before half time. Raja also crashed the post in the first half and Mothwa was required to come off his line to block a shot. But Raja, after Usuthu put up a gallant showing, were finally rewarded for their efforts and Moutouali was on hand to decide the affair which the home side richly deserved.
