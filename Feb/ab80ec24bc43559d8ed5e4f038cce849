A NEW three-part documentary series will be hitting the small screens next week. MTV  Shuga: What Makes a Man will be starting a conversation about the rising levels of violence against women and children in Mzansi. Hosted by MTV Shuga Down South actor Ayanda Makayi, the show kicks off on Tuesday, 1 March. Announcing the news, MTV said the issue discussed is a close one to Ayanda because he played Sol, a perpetrator of abuse, on MTV Shuga. Ayanda, who is also co-producing the doccie, said he hopes it starts a new chapter in Mzansi. “This has been a long time in the making and quite a personal project for me. I am incredibly proud to not only have starred in this documentary series but have executive-produced it as well. What Makes A Man won’t end the epidemic of gender-based violence (GBV) but we’re hoping this is the start of a long road ahead of uncomfortable questions and conversations,” he said.
