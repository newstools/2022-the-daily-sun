THE late Lebo Monene’s colleagues wore black as a reminder of her tragic death. The nurses, who were still struggling to absorb what happened on Wednesday, 9 February, said Lebo would forever be in their hearts. Lebo, who was an assistant nurse, was killed by her cop boyfriend on Wednesday, and later turned the gun on himself. The cop, attached to the Ekurhuleni trio task team, was airlifted to Milpark hospital in Joburg and cops said he was still alive. Lebo’s colleagues described her boyfriend as a bully and possessive. “We wish he could survive and answer for what he did,” said a nurse.  Lebo’s sister, Sylvia, said it was hard to replace her. “Lebo was a calm person who loved peace. She loved people and was also loved by people. My father is struggling to cope,” she said. Sylvia said they were not happy about some of the negative reports they had read on social media. “First of all, Lebo was not married to the cop. He didn’t shoot her after discovering that their daughter was not his and lastly, he didn’t shoot the child; she’s still alive.” Family spokesman Dan Thobakgale said the man was abusive and Lebo once reported him at his work, but no case was opened. “She even told us he had threatened her,” he said.
