A STAGGERING 460 shots were fired at the police ambush where eight thugs died on Monday, 21 February. The area was turned into a war zone as tough cops and a well-trained heist gang levelled assault rifles at each other and let rip. When the smoke cleared and forensics swept the crime scene, 464 cartridges lay spent on the ground. One cop succumbed to his wounds the following day after the showdown in Rosettenville, south of Joburg. The scene was so big it had to be divided into five zones, with one having about 356 cartridges. According to Ipid spokeswoman, Grace Langa, of the eight suspects who were killed, one was ex-military. The first scene was at 50 Friars Hill Road, where one assault rifle, an empty magazine and 23 rounds were found. A total of 72 spent rifle cartridges, five commercial explosives and six Carmex wires, used in explosives, were found. Five stolen vehicles – an Audi Q3, a Ford Ranger, Mercedes-Benz, Range Rover and Audi S4 – were also recovered. At the second scene on the same street, two assault rifles and three magazines loaded with 54 rounds were recovered from a BMW X3, riddled with bullet holes. Two dead suspects, who had sustained multiple gunshot wounds, were inside the car where they had been hit. One deceased suspect lay on the street not far away, where about 356 spent rifle cartridges were found. At the third scene at Short and Violet streets, one assault rifle, four magazines with 117 assault rifle rounds and two spent cartridges of rifle ammunition were found. One deceased suspect, an ex-military member, was lying next to a house on Violet. Also found at the fourth scene at Victoria Street were one AK-47, two magazines loaded with 55 rounds, and one spent rifle cartridge and balaclavas. The last scene was at Hakka Road, where four deceased suspects with gunshot wounds were found inside a house.
