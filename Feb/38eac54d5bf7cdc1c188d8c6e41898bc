THE tragic death of her two babies broke her heart. But actress and TV presenter Ntombee Ngcobo-Mzolo is still standing. In September 2021, Ntombee lost her daughter Vunani Mzolo who died after a car accident. In 2015, she lost her son who was diagnosed with a rare heart condition. He died 28 days after birth. After all the devastating experiences she went through, she believes there’s still room for healing, not only for her, but for other mothers who went through the same sad moments. The former Metro FM DJ wants to help mothers to heal from losing their babies. ALSO READ : THAMI WAVES CHANNEL GOODBYE! She is organising an event called Mothers of Angels set to run in Durban from 25 to 27 February. She said all mothers of angels deserve to be part of her healing event. Ntombee took to Instagram and said: “The fact that I still have the strength to continue hosting these sessions honestly fills my heart.” She said if it was up to her, mothers wouldn’t pay for the sessions. “Unfortunately, we have to pay this fee to cover basic costs but my prayer is for us to get sponsors so that no one has to pay a cent for these sessions going forward because all mothers of angels deserve to be part of this,” she said. For now the event will be in Durban but Ntombee said it will expand to other provinces. A post shared by Ntombee Ngcobo Mzolo ???? (@ntombee_1)
