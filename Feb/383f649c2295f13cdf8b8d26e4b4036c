IT MAY look like any other long-base single cab bakkie when you look at it from the sides and rear. But everything changes the moment you turn to view the Nissan Navara single cab from the front because of its aggressively bold black grille and its attractive lights. Taking a single cab bakkie on a road test is not something many of us look forward to, but this bakkie will make you see that fast cars and double cabs are not the only vehicles to be loved. I enjoyed reviewing this bakkie because driving it around, you get all the benefits of driving stylish fast cars. When its double cab sibling launched in June last year, it got Mzansi excited. This was not only because it is beautiful but also because it was made locally. But little did we know that soon after that, Nissan SA was going to round up the range with an equally nice single cab. The Navara is popular for its rugged yet redefined looks, robust capabilities, reliability and versatility. I did not like the fact that it only allows two people – a driver and one passenger – in the front, and there is no space to store your bags since looters can easily snatch any small bag you place in the loading base.  But high levels of safety and security from entry grades, including driver and passenger airbags standard as well as ABS and Electronic Brake-force Distribution, made me put that space problem slide. The new Navara single cab engines include a 2,5l D0HC petrol engine (XE grade) with a maximum power of 118kW and 233Nm torque. The powerful 2,5l diesel power-train comes in two levels of output. The high output 4x4 engine, which we drove, delivers 140kW of power and 450Nm torque and it will surprise many with speed and precisely respond to all your demands. You also have mid-output (XE and SE grades), with 2,5 litre dual overhead camshafts with direct injection, turbocharged with intercooler diesel engine producing 120kw of power and 403Nm torque, making it the most powerful engine in the class. This makes it the popular choice for southern African pickup drivers. Those who buy it to use it as a work horse will enjoy it, especially the top-class load capacity of up to 1 144kg and durability with reinforced body and suspension. And I can tell you this, people love this bakkie. Everywhere I turned up in it they pointed fingers and started talking in admiration of it. So you will not miss getting the attention you get in your hot hatches.
