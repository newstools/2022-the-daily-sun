THE building process never ends at SuperSport United! The club recently lost their most prized asset in Teboho Mokoena, who joined their Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns on a record-breaking transfer, reportedly R25 million. And with the possibility of losing another player Sipho Mbule at the end of the season, coach Kaitano Tembo has moved swiftly to prepare for the future. He has roped in players such as Selaelo Rasebotja (20), Sibusiso Maziko (21), Caleb Avontuur (18), and Thapelo Maseko (19) from the DStv Diski Challenge team. Maseko made his debut on Tuesday when they lost 2-1 to Maritzburg United in their DStv Premiership league match, while exciting Avontuur was an unused sub. Tembo admitted it was not one of the best debut for the youngster as he struggled. However, he believes the youngster will get better with time: “It is a process. We have a young team. We will continue encouraging and building them up. “I think we have to also start building for the future. We gave young Maseko his debut. It was just unfortunate for the youngster (Maseko) to come in a situation like this, but he will get better. “He was a little bit caught up in the moment, he didn’t really touch the ball that much, but that is the process we will try and build him. With time he will get better and better.” SuperSport will be out of action for almost two weeks as their next match will be on 27 Feb when they host Royal AM at Lucas Moripe Stadium (3pm). Tembo said the time off would help players such as Thamsanqa Gabuza and Keagan Johannes recover from injuries. Tembo added: “With the short break, we will probably get some of our players back, Gabuza and Johannes because we lack a bit of depth. “With them coming back in the next game, I am hoping we will be a better side.”
