THE multimillion rand fraud case against two Gupta associates has been transferred to the Pretoria Regional Court. Kamal Vasram and Saliesh Indurjeeth briefly appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court on Friday, 11 February, facing charges linked to the failed Free State Estina dairy project. They face charges of fraud after a joint investigation by SARS and the Investigating Directorate (ID) revealed that they overpriced a pasteurisation plant. “The investigation revealed that Estina submitted customs clearance documents in support of a VAT refund claim. The declaration was then scrutinised whereupon the declared value of over R37,7 million for a so-called ‘new’ pasteurisation plant was suspected to be excessively high. The suspected overpriced pasteurisation plant, that was imported from India, was rather invoiced to Estina by Gateway Limited in the United Arab Emirates,” said ID spokeswoman Sindisiwe Seboka. She said the evidence that was already in the public domain suggested that Gateway was used and controlled by the Guptas as a conduit to launder money and extract funds from South Africa. “The state further alleges that the overstated or inflated value was intentionally and unlawfully used by Estina and its sole director – Vasram – to launder funds from South Africa, to the prejudice of the taxpaying public in general,” she said. The project was the brainchild of then MEC Mosebenzi Zwane in 2011 to help emerging black farmers. The provincial government set aside R342 million for the project. However, R30 million of that money allegedly ended up funding the Guptas’ lavish Sun City wedding in 2013. The matter was postponed to 9 March for the disclosing of the case docket to the defence.
