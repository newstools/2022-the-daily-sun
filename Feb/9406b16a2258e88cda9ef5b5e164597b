ZIYAKHALA for a slay queen who doesn’t want to pay an Uber driver. She’s looking all pretty with hair and nails done but can’t pay for her ride! The unknown woman has been trending on social media and people are furious at her. A man in the background explains she requested an Uber ride and when she arrived at her destination, she couldn’t pay the driver. The man also claims the same incident happened at Southgate Mall in Joburg, south of Jozi, not so long ago and claims this has become a norm. “She’s a tsotsi of a lady and we’re tired of such women,” he said. The woman claims she told the driver her cash was short. She had it but it was clearly not what was showing on the App. Tiisetso Mokoena said he’s disgusted by this behaviour and it wasn’t the first time he’s seeing this. “They refuse to pay and scream GBV when confronted. These people have families to feed. I’m actually glad this man has this on camera because we don’t know the story she would have cooked up for people to sympathise with her,” he said.  Lizzy Mathebula said some women look pretty and think they can charm their way into not paying the drivers. “Those people are at work and your charm and pretty privilege won’t always save you from life’s situations,” she said. Gugu Ntaka said she’s paid less for a trip before and said maybe the woman had the same experience as her, resulting in this situation. “I was in a tight situation and spoke to the driver before he started the trip, so I think the lady misled the driver. Those people are too understanding,” said Gugu.
