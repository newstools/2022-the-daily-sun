Phakamani Mahlambi, who has been out since early this season due to a knee injury, has started light jogging and not doing any ball work at the moment, according to Chippa United coach Kurt Lentjies. Mahlambi joined The Chilli Boys with hopes of resurrecting his career after some disappointing spells, which derailed his progress. But the long-term knee injury was his biggest Achilles heel, figuratively. "Phaka is still with us, and will be part of us for the future," revealed Lentjies. Lentjies would have loved to have Mahlambi fit during their difficult period where they’re fighting relegation. The former player added: "We are praying for him that he recovers well, it is not nice to lay off for such a long time. "It was very unfortunate for him... but he is taking it one day at a time. It is good to see him running again. At the moment, I am not sure if he will play this season, but I am hoping." Last season Mahlambi was on loan at AmaZulu where he failed to live up to expectations. He went back to Sundowns at the start of the current season where he was offloaded to Chippa. Mahlambi has one year remaining on his five-year deal with Sundowns, which he signed in August 2018.
