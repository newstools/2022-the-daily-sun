HUMAN hair has the power to grow all over our bodies, except the palms of our hands, soles of our feet and lips. According to Kids Health magazine, hair grows faster in summer than winter and slower at night than during the day. Basically, the basic genetic make-up of a human being is solely covered and protected by hair. While that may be the case, there are some areas in the body that one may find weird or abnormal to find hair in. According to human anatomy, hair can also grow inside the mouth and on a tongue. And, experts say this is normal. According to American Academy of Oral Medicine, having a hairy tongue is a normal condition that affects 13% of the global population. This condition is a result of filiform papillae that don’t shed as they should, according to Healthline. Filiform papillae are cone-shaped projections on the surface of your tongue. Like skin cells, the cells on your tongue have a life cycle that allows them to grow, serve their purpose and then fall off. For people with a hairy tongue, the filiform papillae grow longer instead of falling off. They may grow as long as 18mm and as they do so, the papillae begin collecting debris like bacteria and food. The food you eat and products you put in your mouth can also discolour the filiform papillae. According to oral experts, having a hairy tongue is often temporary and usually harmless. This is more common in older people, though it can develop at any age. It is also more common in men and often caused by a lack of stimulation on the top of the tongue, which can prevent proper shedding. Excessive smoking and use of drugs can also cause this condition.
