POPULAR Mzansi Magic reality show Our Perfect Wedding (OPW) has a new host. The 12th season of the show will be hosted by Lebogang Tlokana, affectionately known as The Funny Chef. Being the first chef to host OPW, the channel believes she is a perfect fit as she will have an input in decor, food and clothing – all forming part of a perfect wedding. Mzansi Magic confirmed the news through a statement. Director of M-Net local entertainment channels Shirley Adonisi said OPW wanted different creatives to share their talent and energy. “One of the things we’re most proud and committed to as a channel is giving different creatives the platform to share their talent and energy. Our Perfect Wedding has been one of the leaders in this regard. It has continued to refresh itself with an interesting and versatile range of presenters, all of whom have connected with viewers in their own way. We’re proud to keep the tradition going,” said Shirley. ALSO READ | RIKY RICKS WIFE HEARTBROKEN Late last year, Lebogang’s friend DJ Lamiez broke the news on Twitter but later deleted the post.
