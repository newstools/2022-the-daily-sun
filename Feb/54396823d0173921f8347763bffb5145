ANOTHER successful boxing tournament is under the belt for top promoter Joy Kungwane of TLB Promotion who delivered on her promise once again. The “No Glove, No Love” tourney, staged at the Memorial Hall in Kagiso on Sunday, lived up to the hype in the build as punches flew in from all angles. The main event, which saw Mzansi’s Junior Makondo face Jacques Muvud from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for the vacant WBF middleweight title, ended in an enthralling draw. Makondo, the 26-year-old from Malamulele in Limpopo, was hoping to clinch his first major title when he stepped up to face Muvud on home soil. His counterpart, Muvud, also came prepared and he had no intentions of letting Makondo do as he pleased in the ring in front of his home fans. In the main supporting bout, the tough as nails Khaya Busakwe held on to his Gauteng lightweight title after he also fought to a draw against the determined Talent Baloyi. Kholosa Ndobayini eased past Cecilia Pitisani in an international female lightweight battle – winning by Unanimous Decision.
