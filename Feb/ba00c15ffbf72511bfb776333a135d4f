RICHARDS Bay chairman, Sfiso Biyela, says there’s nothing special about their GladAfrica Championship rivals JDR Stars. Biyela is confident they will do the double over Stars in a top-of-the-table clash at the King Zwelithini Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). It promises to be a thrilling clash with both sides level at the top of the standings with 32 points after 17 matches. Neither side can afford to lose, as defeat would dent their automatic promotion hopes. Biyela has expressed confidence in his team, stating they will get maximum points. He said: “There’s nothing special about them (Stars). We have beaten them before, so we will go there and we will get three points.” The Natal Rich Boyz go into the game with an incredible 12 match unbeaten run in the Championship. Biyela is positive that they will maintain their position on top of the table with 13 games left to play. “In 13 games, there are 39 points to play for, if we get 23 points, we are in the PSL (next season),” said Biyela. Bay were brought down to earth when they were beaten 4-0 by DStv Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns in their Nedbank Cup last-32 clash two weeks ago. But the chairman said the loss to Masandawana didn’t kill their confidence heading into tomorrow’s crunch game. “The players are still fine. We don’t have a problem,” he said. It wasn’t a busy transfer window for Richards Bay, they only signed Tshepo Liphoko from Royal AM. Biyela said he’s happy with the depth of his squad but is still negotiating to sign a striker. “I am happy with the squad we have, we’ve been doing well, the record is there to prove it,” said Biyela. He said Liphoko is adapting well and is hopeful he will give them options moving forward. “He’s a good player with experience,” added Biyela.
