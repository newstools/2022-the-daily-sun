HE was the type of man who could not keep his hands to himself. And today, a manager from a restaurant in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni was arrested for fondling the private parts of a female colleague. The woman reported him to their bosses and they called the cops. Boksburg North Police Station Constable Justice Ramaube said while the woman (21) was collecting fruit from the cold room at work, her manager locked the door and started touching her. “She further alleged that he unzipped her work suit, she then cried and asked him to let her go,” said Ramaube.

The woman said the same manager came back later after she left the cold room to put his foot in between her thighs as she was cleaning the floor. “When he saw her reaction, he immediately pulled his foot back.” She reported him to management, who in turn called the police to arrest him. Ramaube said the 40-year-old man was detained for sexual assault for further investigations. “I felt like he was taking me for a cheap slut and I just wanted to show him that he needs to respect women,” she said Ramaube said the suspect was expected to appear in court this week.
