AMAZULU midfielder Keagan Buchanan says they won’t show Moroccan giants Raja Casablanca any respect in their backyard. Usuthu face Raja in their opening Caf Champions League Group B match at Mohamed V Stadium on Saturday evening (9pm). Buchanan is aware they won’t have an easy passage to glory considering that Mzansi teams always struggle away against Moroccan clubs. Chiefs can attest to that having fought hard to overcome Wydad Athletic Club 1-0 in the semi-final first leg at the same venue last season on their way to the final where they lost to Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly. Said Buchanan: “This is a big experience as it’s our first time in the Champions League (group stages), and a big honour for the club,” said Buchanan. “We are excited and looking forward to the game. We will give them the respect they deserve but on the field, we will go all out with our plan to get a result.” Raja are used to Caf competitions, having humiliated Orlando Pirates when they walloped them 5-1 on aggregate in the Confederation Cup quarter-finals last year. Raja scored four goals at the Mohamed V Stadium in the second leg. But Buchanan is unfazed about their lack of experience at this level. The former Maritzburg United midfielder said having eliminated Nyasa Big Bullets of Malawi in the preliminary round, Congolese giants TP Mazembe in the first round, this will augur well to handle the pressure. The 30-year-old said they will rely on experienced players such as Tsepo Masilela, Hendrik Ekstein, Siphelele Mthembu, Kgotso Moleko and Philani Zulu, who have gained experience in the Champions League. “Experience is obviously needed in times like this,” said Buchanan. “Also to those who haven’t played at this level, it’s nice to challenge themselves against the best in Africa.”
