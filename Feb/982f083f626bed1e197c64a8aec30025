PEPPER spraying boozers to protect his business has turned out badly for sangoma, Dr Mavusi Gqola. Gqola told Daily Sun the boozers arrived at around midday on Sunday, 30 January, in front of his yard in Mfuleni, Cape Town. “I work with people. I can’t focus while people are drinking outside and playing music. I asked them politely to leave but they refused. “After being ignored, I pepper-sprayed them and went back into my yard, but one of them threw a chair at me,” said Gqola. ALSO READ | ARMED

OLD CLIENTS POKE KA SKOLOTO! “I have opened a case against him because they came to make chaos in other people’s houses.” He said boozers sometimes left bottles, and he had to hire people to clean the mess. He said people needed to respect other people’s houses. “I don’t drink but I’m always hiring people to clean up after they’ve left,” he said. “These boozers were full of themselves, telling me I do not own the place where they were sitting. “When I told them to go, they called me names. I will not tolerate being disrespected by anybody,” he said. A resident said she understood the sangoma’s frustration. “I hate it when boozers leave their own houses and cause chaos at other people’s homes.” She said Gqola had every right to chase them away. Police spokesman Sergeant Wesley Twigg said a case of assault had been opened for investigation, with no arrests yet.
