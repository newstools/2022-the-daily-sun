TS GALAXY coach Sead Ramovic has warned his team not to get too excited by their Nedbank Cup heroics against Kaizer Chiefs as they still have “a big job” ahead. The Rockets ensured lightning struck twice as they delivered another blow in Chiefs’ pursuit to end their seven-year trophy drought. Ramovic’s side, who have become Chiefs’ bogey team in recent years, defeated the Soweto giants 1-0 in Ke Yona Cup last 32 round at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Augustine Kwem scored the solitary goal that dumped Amakhosi out of the competition in the first round for the second season in a row having suffered the same fate last term at the hands of Richards Bay. Galaxy, who beat Chiefs in the final of this competition in 2019, making their name at the expense of Chiefs, continue to torment the Glamour Boys. Ramovic, however, doesn’t want the result to go to his players’ heads and was quick to remind them about the DStv Premiership where their status remains under threat. “If we don’t win the next game, we are still in big trouble,” said Ramovic. “This win is good and we must enjoy it now, but we have to focus on the big goal. The Chiefs game is in the past now. We have to start afresh and work harder. “There is a huge gap, we have to keep improving and keep climbing up (the table). If you don’t work hard on your weaknesses everyday then you will not improve. The discipline, self-awareness and patience helps to improve the confidence in the team.” Galaxy are bottom of the table with 13 points from 17 matches. They next face Swallows FC at the Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday hoping to carry the winning momentum into the league. “I’m happy that after three months, we have made improvements,” added Ramovic.
