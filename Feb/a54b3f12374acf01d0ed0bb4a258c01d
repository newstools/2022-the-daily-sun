THE SA Football Association (Safa) National Executive Committee (NEC) will meet before the end of the month to find common ground on whether to continue bidding for the 2027 Fifa Women’s World Cup. The meeting, which will be headed by Safa president Danny Jordaan, will also involve representatives from the government and potential funders should they reach a consensus to bid for the event. Safa first expressed interest in hosting the women’s showpiece last year. This was after they lost the 2023 bid to Australia and New Zealand. Safa believes Mzansi is capable after having successfully hosted the 2010 Fifa World Cup and the 2009 Fifa Confederations Cup, a dress rehearsal to the World Cup finals. “If we host the Women’s World Cup and we have a competitive women’s team in that World Cup, that will be the final step in establishing strong commercial breakthrough for the future of women’s football,” Jordaan said.
