THE National Task Team investigating political related cases have made a breakthrough in the murder of the IFP’s Reginald Ndima, who was recently gunned down. Ndima, who was a member of the IFP national council and speaker of Amajuba District Municipality, was shot and killed in his home driveway in Newcastle, KZN on 29 January. But on Friday, 11 February the task team brought the killers to book. Police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe said within days after the commission of the crime, two suspects were arrested and charged with the murder of the late municipal speaker. “The pair were found with a 357 magnum revolver, which was seized and taken in for ballistic analysis to determine if the firearm was used in the commission of the crime. The task team has also seized a Ford Ranger that is believed to have been utilised by the pair as a getaway vehicle,” said Mathe. Two suspects – Mhlonishwa Sokhulu and Sibusiso Chocholo – have already made brief appearances in the Newcastle Magistrates Court where they have been remanded in custody for a formal bail application that will be heard on Monday, 14 February. Police national commissioner General Khehla Sitole has applauded the team for the timeous response in apprehending those who are believed to be behind the murder of the late speaker. “This latest arrest must serve as a deterrent to those who continually perpetrate such crimes. We will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are deployed to prevent and combat any further incidents of this nature. We also urge our communities to work closely with the SAPS in combatting these heinous crimes,” said Sitole.
