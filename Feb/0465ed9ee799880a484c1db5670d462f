MAGGY Mahlaba is appealing for help to bury her brother Lucas. Maggy (50) said Lucas (31) drowned in the flood that hit Eerste Fabriek in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, on Saturday, 5 February. Maggy from Brazzaville in Atteridgeville said her brother was already dead when he was found next to a shack. “We found my brother in the water. He was living alone in his shack and we don’t know exactly what happened during the flood.”  Maggy said Lucas was found two shacks away from his place. “We last spoke to him on the phone on 29 January and he promised to visit me on 4 February. He didn’t come and we don’t know why because he didn’t have a phone,” she said. “This is so sad. I have lost a brother who cared for us and loved us.” Maggy said it was very traumatic and shocking to find her brother’s body in the water. She said they identified him by the red T-shirt he was wearing. Maggy said he survived on piece work. “We need help from anyone who can help us bury him as we don’t have the money to do it ourselves.” She said her family needed to bury Lucas in Rathoke Village in Limpopo, where the family was from, but didn’t have the money. City of Tshwane spokesman Sipho Stuurman said: “We are aware of the death of a person during the flood. The family should send us a request and we can deal with it.”
