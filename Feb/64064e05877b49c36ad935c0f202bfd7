The event, organised by Project Uluvo, took place at Thusong Centre in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Eric Khweleta said they decided to host a physical conference after a virtual one on social media. Issues that were discussed included the killing of women and children, and absent fathers. “The image men have is not nice. We hope the conference will change how they do things, not only at home but also in their communities.” Eric said men were encouraged to be more involved in their children’s lives. “Sending money is not enough. Men need to be there physically.” He said they were aiming to continue hosting events to end GBV. “We want a society where women and children are free to go where ever they want, without fearing for their lives,” he said. Sikelela Zokufa, founder of Somagwaza Institute, said it was sad to see men from initiation school continuing to behave like boys. “At initiation school, we teach boys about values and what it means to be a man. “We get shocked when we see them not doing what is expected of them,” he said. Luzuko Mnyameni (45) said men needed to take action and protect women.
