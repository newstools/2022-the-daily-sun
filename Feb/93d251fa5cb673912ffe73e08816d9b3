DJ SBU has poured cold water on rumours that he’s training to be a sangoma. This comes after the musician and businessman, whose real name is Sibusiso Leope, told social media users they should hug trees to awaken their spirits, which raised eyebrows. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said: “I am a very vocal person. I think by now everyone would know if I was undergoing initiation to become a sangoma. I am an open book. In the past few months, I’ve been on a journey of self-discovery, learning more about my culture and my ancestry. I decided to share the knowledge I have gathered with my followers and it happened that one of my videos went viral.” ALSO READ: PICS: DRAMA SPLITS SENZO'S FAMILY! Sbu said people jumped to the conclusion that he was becoming a sangoma as they were programmed to think that someone is a sangoma when they connect with their roots. A number of social media users called Sbu crazy, with some even going as far as saying he was going through a mid-life crisis. But, he said he wasn’t fazed. “I had a lot of people swear at me and call me all sorts of names, but I let it slide as I knew a lot of them spoke from a place of not being informed,” he said. “I’m glad the video went viral as it brought a good conversation into the mainstream. People have been learning about the importance of hugging trees.” Sbu also said he’ll soon release a single titled Maru A Pula, which is from an album he plans to release in April.
