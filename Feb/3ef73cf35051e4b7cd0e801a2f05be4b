A
32-year-old Mangaung man has been arrested for murder after the 9-year-old son
of his ex-girlfriend was poisoned. Free State
police spokesperson Sergeant Mahlomola Kareli said the child's mother had gone
out to see her friend on Saturday afternoon and bathed her son before she left. It's
unclear whether the child was alone when his mother's ex-boyfriend showed up
unannounced. Kareli said
the child's uncle arrived later that day but that the ex-boyfriend had already
left by then. According
to Kareli, everything seemed fine "until the uncle noticed the boy
sweating" "His
condition deteriorated with excessive vomiting at around 20:00. That's when the
boy's uncle rushed him to the hospital," Kareli added. The child's
mother was not home yet but joined them at the hospital. However,
the child didn't survive. Kareli
said: When the
police were made aware of the sudden sickness and passing of the child, the
Kopanong detectives registered an inquest file. A Post mortem was then
conducted. It allegedly confirmed that the child died due to poisoning. "The
child was the only one who fell sick in the family and it seems the poison was
only given to him when he was alone with the ex-boyfriend," Kareli added. He said
police went to the man's house multiple times but couldn't find him. He was
eventually arrested when he returned home. He is
expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court on Friday. SOURCE:
