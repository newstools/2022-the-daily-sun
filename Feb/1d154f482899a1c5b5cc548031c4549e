ANC leader
Solomzi "Solly" Ntwana and his three-year-old son were shot dead in Grabouw,
in the Western Cape. The
shooting occurred around 21:50 in Charmaine Street on Tuesday. Ntwana had
been member of the Theewaterskloof municipality. According
to police spokesperson Colonel Andre Traut, Ntwana and his son were shot and
killed in their vehicle by an unknown person, who is yet to be arrested. On Tuesday,
the leaders of Theewaterskloof municipality visited Ntwana's family to pay
their respects. The
municipality said it was saddened by the deaths. Ntwana had
been employed by the municipality in 2007 and became an integral member of the
Theewaterskloof human settlements department. "He
was the senior housing development officer in Grabouw and was known for his
humble demeanour, his sense of calm and his infectious laughter," said the
mayor, Kallie Papier. The
municipality said Ntwana was responsible for the administrative housing
functions in Grabouw, but was always ready to assist where he could. He often
offered to help with informal settlement and operational support within the
town. "He is
missed as a beloved colleague and will be remembered for his contribution to
bettering our communities," Papier said. The motive
for the shooting is still unknown. Police have
opened a double murder case for investigation. Any person
who can shed light on the matter is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop on
