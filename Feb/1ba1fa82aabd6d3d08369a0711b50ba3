A MAN from Thailand recently cut off his penis during a frightening zol psychotic episode. According to Daily Mail, the incident happened after the unidentified 23-year-old man smoked 2g of dagga – about six joints. It is reported that before the horror incident, the man had quit smoking zol for three months after being a regular for two years. The publication also reports that the man began to have a painful erection two hours after smoking the drug for the first time in months. “In an attempt to eradicate the problem, the man decided to use a pair of scissors to ‘trim’ the skin of his penis before amputating it completely, leaving a 2cm stump and 5cm laceration in his scrotum,” the article read. In an attempt to save his manhood, Dr Theerapon Tangsuwanaruk said medics tried to reattach it but it was found to be too fragile and contaminated with ants. “The distal penis was deemed too dirty and fragile for reconstruction. The amputated distal part of the penis was contaminated with ants and had fragile dorsal veins,” Dr Tangsuwanaruk told the publication.
