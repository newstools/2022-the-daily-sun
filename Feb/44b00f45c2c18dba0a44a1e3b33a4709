WAIT, what? Shacks on the beach? How can that be? A trending photo of shacks being built next to the Macassar Beach in Cape Town has shocked many people. While some said this was the worst thing, others were ready to become part of the development. Luyolo Mgoduka (38) said he was borrowing money to buy material when someone broke his heart by telling him the shacks were built by a film crew. These shacks, that are part of a movie, will come down thereafter. “I don’t think this photo should have reached the community. It gave us ideas that we might build our shacks there,” said Luyolo. Phumzile Poswa (40) said she would not be surprised if people tried to put up structures after the film. “If people can build shacks in wetlands, what will stop them from building right next to the beach?” she asked. “When people build shacks, they don’t think about what will happen next. Another resident said he was waiting for the City of Cape Town to go and destroy the structures. “I knew there was something about the photo other than land invasion because the city would never allow anyone to build next to the beach. I’m glad it’s not something permanent,” said the resident. The city said the structures were for a film set that would be filmed in the next four days, and would then be dismantled and removed upon completion.
