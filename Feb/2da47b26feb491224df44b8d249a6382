“THE five Ss of sports training are stamina, speed, strength, skill and spirit; but the greatest of these is spirit.” These words were taken from Ken Doherty, an Irish professional snooker player, commentator and radio presenter, highlighting important characteristics involved in sports. The five Ss each represent an element that also forms an important part of sex. While sex can also be classified as a sport, fitness experts also claim some sporting codes are great for sex. According to AsiaOne magazine, here are some of the sports that are great for sex: 1. Soccer If you want to score the right goals in bed, then soccer is your go-to sport for sex. Playing a game or two can increase your testosterone levels by up to 30%, and this increase in testosterone boosts your libido. 2. Running This is a great way to rid your body of things that make you stressed, like pent-up energy, tension and excess adrenaline. Stress is a major libido killer, and chances are if you’re feeling stressed, you won’t want to have sex. Therefore, going for a jog or run will bring down your anxiety levels, and should help increase your sex drive. Not only does running make you feel less stressed, it also releases endorphins that will make you feel good. 3. Beach volleyball The tight swimwear, great tans and fit, toned bodies make beach volleyball one of the sexiest sports around. Playing volleyball means playing outside. And studies have found that as doses of vitamin D increase, gained from sunshine, testosterone levels rise. Just one hour in the sun can significantly boost this sex hormone.
