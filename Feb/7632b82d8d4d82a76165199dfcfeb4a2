The radical economic transformation hyenas Julius Malema and Advocate Dali Mpofu must be removed from the Judicial Service Commission interviews. This is because they are only there to oppose the appointment of Raymond Zondo as the next Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court. This is not fair on Zondo. We all know that Malema and Mpofu hate Zondo with passion. The question is: who planted the two Zuma stooges in the panel? I doubt that Zondo will get a fair vote. The mandate from Nkandla is to derail Zondo’s efforts to succeed the evergreen Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. To preserve the integrity of the judiciary, the chairman should get rid of Zuma’s henchmen. They are not there to add value to the commission and its work. ) Bushy Green, Kagiso
