METRO FM DJ Speedsta has called it quits. In his emotional message to his fans, he said his resignation comes after sacrificing a lot to be in the job. Speesta’s post reads: “It was April 2017, I was on holiday in Amsterdam. I had just signed a new contract at YFM. Out of nowhere, I get a call saying ‘we want you at metro...’. “I took all my savings and bought myself out my YFM contract to go do my dream job. Today, it’s a sad one for me, but an interesting one. I sacrificed my Saturday nights, my gigs, missed plenty weddings, plenty Saturday nights, missed a lot of time with people who care for me. I told the Lord last year that there’s no way I’m doing that any longer and here we are.” He thanked everyone at Metro for believing in him and for all the moments.

We did our thing, me, Looty and Jawz. Absolute hip hop!! “Was so sad to tell auntie Merissa that this was the last invoice we’re doing. When I was at Y(FM) we put people on. When I was at Metro we put more people on. I’m glad I could contribute to the culture. In all honesty, I’m tired!! “I’m tired of a lot of things. A story for another day. We’re out, thank you and goodbye Metro FM family,” he wrote. His fans had a tough time trying to take in the news. Malusi Mayweni said: “My G, you just got here and I was warming up to your show. Very sad. I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavours.” A post shared by DJ Speedsta (@speedstabro)
