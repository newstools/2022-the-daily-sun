DEPUTY higher education minister Buti Manamela has started the first phase of a countrywide public awareness campaign on bogus colleges. Manamela visited two private colleges – Tshwane City College and Bristol Training College – in Tshwane on Tuesday, 1 February. The second phase of the campaign will take place in Joburg on Thursday, 3 February. Manamela said the department has a responsibility to regulate private institutions. “Our intention is to monitor compliance of these colleges with our legislation. We are quite happy that both colleges I visited are compliant and registered with our department,” he said. “Our intention is to protect citizens. We want to make a plea to parents and prospective students, both in basic and higher education, to ensure that they check every institution they want to register at. “They need to check if the institution is registered and the programmes they want to study are accredited.” Manamela said where they found colleges that were operating illegally, he would make sure the department worked with police and prosecutors to make sure they were closed. He advised citizens that if they went to a college and it did not produce a registration certificate for the institution and programme you wanted to register for, then you should call the department. Manamela said people operating bogus colleges would be prosecuted because people were losing time and money. He warned colleges to stop circulating pamphlets for certificates and diplomas they didn’t offer. Bristol director Frank Akuche said: “I do appreciate the visit.”
