VOMITING or throwing up is one of the most unpleasant and sometimes the most embarrassing things to experience. By definition, vomiting is the act of ejecting matter from the stomach through the mouth. According to Heal-line magazine, vomiting is a symptom that accompanies a variety of conditions, ranging from infection to chronic illness. Oftentimes, its colour will change as your body progresses through each stage of the underlying condition. For example, vomit as a result of the stomach flu may start as green or yellow and progress to orange. So, Health-line magazine helps us unpack what does the colour of the vomit indicate about our health: 1. Clear vomit Clear vomit usually occurs after you’ve already thrown up several times, effectively emptying your stomach of its food contents. This is often caused by illnesses such as morning sickness, stomach flu and migraines. 2. White vomit Your vomit may appear white if you’ve eaten something white, like ice cream or drank milk. Foamy vomit may develop if you have excess gas in your stomach. This often means you must see a doctor. 3. Green or yellow vomit Green or yellow vomit may indicate that you’re bringing up a fluid called bile. This fluid is created by the liver and stored in your gallbladder. Bile isn’t always cause for concern. This means you might be suffering from mild illnesses such as stomach flu and morning sickness. 4. Orange vomit The colour orange is the colour of partially digested foods which may persist if you continue eating between vomiting episodes. Unless it persists for more than a day or two, orange vomit usually isn’t cause for concern. 5. Pink vomit Vomiting large amounts of blood is also called hematemesis. Although it’s often pink or bright red, it may also appear black or dark brown. You should always see your doctor if you have pink, red, or otherwise bloody vomit.
