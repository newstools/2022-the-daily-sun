GQOM star King Sdudla has split from his popular group Sdudla No Ma1000 and is pursuing a solo career. The duo known for their hits, StimelaSasebhayi and Momo, stopped working together late last year and Sdudla, whose real name is Lungelo Msizi, has been enjoying working alone. Speaking to SunBuzz, Sdudla from Gqeberha in Eastern Cape said: “We split because I felt like I needed to be on my own. “Also, we used our names instead of a group name because we wanted it to be easier when we decide to go solo.

All is going well so far,” said the musician. He will drop a single titled Ngasho on Friday, 4 February. “This is my first single of the year and my first project since I went solo. “Ngasho is about all my manifestations for 2022. I am talking about all the things I want to achieve. I just hope my solo career will be better and bigger,” he said.
