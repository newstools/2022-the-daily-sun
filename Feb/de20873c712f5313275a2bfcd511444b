KAIZER Chiefs’ legal battle with the PSL is set for another postponement on Friday, according to the league’s prosecutor Zola Majavu. Chiefs failed to honour two DStv Premiership matches in December last year citing exorbitant positive Covid-19 test results in their Village, hence they skipped games against Cape Town City FC and Golden Arrows respectively. Chiefs stated that more than 50 personnel had tested positive at the time and they were forced to temporally close their clubhouse in Naturena. In accordance with the league’s compliance manual, the PSL had to charge them for failing to honour the two fixtures. Independent arbitrator Advocate Nassir Cassim was recently appointed to hear the Chiefs' case. Explains Majavu: "I can confirm that the matter concerning Kaizer Chiefs will indeed be before the DC of the 25th of February 2022 where after it may well be postponed further on the basis that the arbitration has yet to be finalised. However, the matter must still be ventilated before the PSL DC which would then give further directives as it may deem fit." Majavu also revealed that the league had warned four PSL clubs following failure to comply with the Covid-19 regulations. He said: "There has been four club that have been issued with formal letters of reprimand for failure to comply with Covid related protocols. Even though the league has not issued them with fines, we regarded the matter sufficiently important to bring to the attention of the affected clubs so that in future should they not hid the warning then formal charges will be proffered against them."
