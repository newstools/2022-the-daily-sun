MISO Mandla (21) finished his initiation in December but never enjoyed being a new man. This is because he was killed in Langa, Cape Town, on Saturday, 12 February. Sister Zintle (26) said he was stabbed while walking with friends. She said he bought brandy to introduce himself to other new men. “The people who stabbed him asked for the bottle. He didn’t realise other new men were following them and they asked about the brandy. “He told them those who made it had drank it. They beat him until he fell. “One stabbed him in the throat and said ‘eyemadoda ayipheli.” She said he didn’t deserve to die for alcohol. Somagwaza Institute founder Sikelela Zokufa said: “We are shocked new men came from the bushes and did this as if they were never told what it means to be a man.” Captain Frederick van Wyk said cops were investigating. “The victim was taken to hospital, where he was declared dead.” The suspects fled.
