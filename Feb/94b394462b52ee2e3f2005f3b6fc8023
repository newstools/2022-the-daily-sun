ON Saturday, 5 February, she went to her friend’s place where she was meant to sleep over. But they fought and the 37-year-old decided to walk home. She left her phone behind as she was afraid of being robbed. But on her way home in Marikana squatter camp in Philippi, Cape Town, she said she came across four thugs who asked her why she was out at night alone. “They first asked where I was going. Then one of them slapped me just before I could answer. They beat me up, saying I wanted to add to the statistics of women who are being raped and killed.” The woman said one of the thugs said they should take her phone to teach her a lesson. They then asked for it, but she told them she didn’t have a phone. “They said the only thing they want is cars and I was disturbing them. After beating me up, they walked me next to my house. My ancestors worked overtime that night, because there was no way the thugs could just beat me up. “I think they attacked me because I didn’t have money or a cellphone.” Asked if she had opened a case, she said: “I didn’t open a case because I know nothing was going to happen. The police were going to investigate until we all forgot about it.” The woman urged women to stop walking alone at night.“Let’s stop being outside our homes at night. I know I might not be lucky the next time,” she said. Colonel Mzoxolo Jada of Philippi cop shop said the woman could visit the police station and open a case. “It’s her right to open a case and the cops will investigate.” The woman said she’ll open a case this week.
