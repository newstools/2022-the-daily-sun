THE hard-working women of Mzansi are finally being honoured. Panache Productions will celebrate 50 inspiring women from different countries, including South Africa, Mauritius and India through a publication. Founder and CEO Farzana Mayet said the women had not only excelled in their chosen fields, but had also given back to their communities. “Each one of them has a unique trademark that makes them trailblazers in their fields,” she said. One of the featured women is Dineo Stiyana, based in Tshwane. She is a businesswoman and mother of two. Dineo is the founder and CEO of Peuneo, that has teamed up with big employers to train workers in a wide range of skills. “We continue to widen our services to provide real work and life skills that propel people towards their goals,” she said. Another woman being featured is Ilva Jorgo, a business development head and partner at Sobek, an infrastructure development advisory. It specialises in forensic investigations. Ilva said: “I hope our success stories inspire more young women to rise up and be successful. Gone are the days when women were not allowed in certain fields.”
