ORLANDO Pirates resumed their 2021-22 campaign on a high with a hard-fought 1-0 win over AmaZulu at Orlando Stadium yesterday. As a result, the Soweto giants booked their spot in the Last-16 of the Nedbank Cup – taking a step closer to adding silverware into their cabinet. Siyabonga Mpontshane was the hero for Orlando Pirates as he pulled off a stunning save at the death to send his side into the next round. The 35-year-old shot stopper came up tops from the penalty spot as he thwarted Tapelo Xoki’s effort in the dying minutes of the match. Pirates had broken the deadlock through a lovely strike from Deon Hotto in the 53rd minute, a goal that proved to be the winner. Hotto, who was named the man of the match for his efforts, took off on a lovely run before he swiveled and struck a powerful shot past Veli Mothwa in the AmaZulu goal. The goal sparked Usuthu into life as they pushed hard to get back into the match, pushing Pirates back for the better part of the second half. But as they pushed for the equalizer, Benni McCarthy’s side were left exposed at the back and Bucs threatened to stretch their lead. However, one goal proved to be enough in the end with Xoki denied Usuthu’s last real chance at pulling them level. Pirates have now beaten Usuthu twice in consecutive matches having won 2-1 in their last meeting which was the final match of 2021. Bucs will now turn their attention to the Caf Confederation Cup where they face JS Saoura from Algeria at the same venue next Sunday. Usuthu, on the other hand, will look to bounce back in the Caf Champions League where they face Raja Casablanca in their first group stage match.
