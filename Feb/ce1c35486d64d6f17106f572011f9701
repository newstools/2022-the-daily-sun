AL Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane continues to prove that he is amongst the elite managers of the football world. Mosimane recently rubbed shoulders with legendary former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in a meeting that lasted nearly two hours. Mosimane took to social media to express his gratitude for the time spent with Wenger. He revealed that the meeting was supposed to last 15 – 20 minutes, but it lasted for 120 minutes (full 90 and extra time in a cup match). Pitso Mosimane: "My meeting with Arsene Wenger was supposed to last 15-20 minutes but ended up going on for 120 minutes. I am so humbled to have been given the opportunity to hear the words of wisdom from this icon." The meeting details were not revealed; however, it appears that Banyana Banyana Coach, Desiree Ellis, Kalusha Bwayla, David Dean, and MT Sports were responsible for ensuring that the meeting happened. It is no surprise to see Mosimane rubbing shoulders with football royalties, having won three Caf Champions League, three Super Cups, and two FIFA Club World Cup bronze Medals consecutively. Title defence will continue for Mosimane's Al Ahly when they face his former team, Mamelodi Sundowns, on Saturday at Cairo International Stadium (9:00 pm).
