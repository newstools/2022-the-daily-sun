Strawberry Legs is the term given to the appearance of dark or red small spots on one’s legs, resembling the skin and seeds of a strawberry. This occurs due to enlarged pores or hair follicles that trap oil, bacteria and dead skin. After being shaved, these areas are exposed to air and consequently darken in colour and become more irritated. Blunt razors, clogged pores or overly dry skin can aggravate the appearance of strawberry legs and further darken the spots that are created.
