In an interview with the SA Football Journalist Association (Safja) virtual press conference on Wednesday, Pitso Mosimane (57) revealed that he has given up on his ambitions to coach in Europe. This he says is following his chat with Manchester United legend Dwight Yorke in Europe. “Those are fairy-tale stories," said the Al Ahly coach who walked away with bronze medl during the Fifa Club World Cup. "It would never happen, and I spoke to Yorke, and he told me to forget about it. "European legends with Uefa A Pro-License coaching badges can’t get coaching jobs. I’m okay with Europe let me stay on the continent,” said Mosimane. On his exclusion from the Fifa Best awards nomination list, Mosimane said: “It is about where you are coaching and not where you come from, in my opinion, and I wish to know the criteria used to decide the Coach of the Year?” Al Ahly are in the same Caf Champions League group with Mamelodi Sundowns and are the favourites to defend their Champions League title.Mosimane stressed he does not have to beat his former team to win the Champions League. “For me to be honest, the Champions League starts in the quarterfinals, not in the group stages, and the Egyptian title is also important for me,” he said. Al Ahly will play Sundowns in Cairo on 25 February and visit them in Tshwane on 11 March.
