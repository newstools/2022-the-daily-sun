 Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is getting sued by a second female employee for sexual harassment in less than a month. The two lawsuits allege there’s a “hostile work environment” against women at the car maker’s factory. Erica Cloud accused the defendants, including her former manager, of “continuous and pervasive” sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in the Alameda County Superior Court in California on Wednesday, 9 February. She alleged the manager hugged and massaged her while making crude and suggestive remarks. She said she was now experiencing retaliation from other managers after complaining to Tesla’s human resources team. Tesla did not immediately respond to Reuters’ emailed questions. On 18 November, another worker, Jessica Barraza, filed a lawsuit alleging rampant sexual harassment at the factory in Fremont, California. Earlier in October, a black contract worker had won a $137 million (about R2 billion) jury award over workplace racism against Tesla. – REUTERS
