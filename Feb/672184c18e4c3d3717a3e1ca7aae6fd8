HUMANS naturally breath through their noses. Breathing through the nose helps to warm and filter the air before it reaches your lungs. Some people breathe through the mouth for a number of reasons. It might be that it happens when they are sleeping or due to an illness. Breathing through the mouth doesn’t have the same benefits as nose breathing, thus leaving your mouth dry and uncomfortable. Stanford Children’s Health notes that some illnesses such as colds, the flu or sinus infections can leave you with a stuffy nose, while a nasal reaction to an allergen or irritant such as pollen or pollution can cause a blocked nose which may cause you to breathe through the mouth. The American Dental Association reported that a dry mouth that is caused by breathing through your mouth may lead to bad breath. The association also warns that another potential complication of a dry mouth is tooth decay as without saliva to wash bacteria off the teeth, plaque can build up and destroy the tooth structure. Breathing through your mouth also has potential to cause mouth-breathing gingivitis. Children with this condition may have red, swollen gums and their gums may partially cover the teeth. To learn how to breathe through the nose instead of the mouth, you should see your dentist or doctor for an evaluation because some causes may be more serious. The treatment for mouth breathing will vary depending on its exact cause. You may be prescribed nasal rinses, nasal sprays, oral medications or surgery as treatment. In addition, you may also need treatments for oral complications caused by mouth breathing.
