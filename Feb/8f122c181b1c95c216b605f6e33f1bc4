NOLUVO Sokoko is still shocked after she was stabbed by a person posing as a police officer. The 33-year-old From Ivory Park in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she was sleeping at about 3am when she heard a loud knock at the door. “Open up, it’s the police,” a voice commanded, she said. She said her relative also woke up and rushed to her, saying there was someone at the door. She said although the incident happened on 12 February, the child was still traumatised. “The man kicked at the door and I opened it,” she said, only to realise that he was not wearing police uniform. “He pulled out an okapi and wanted to stab me on my chest, but I blocked it with my arms. “I would be dead by now if I didn’t block that knife as I kept seeing my own death coming.” She said she screamed for help and the people came later. “By that time, the man had already disappeared in the dark and I had been stabbed nine times,” she said. “He stabbed me three times on the hand and six times on my arm,” she said. The angry woman said she wanted to see her attacker behind bars. She said the stranger was wearing an Uzzi green tracksuit top and a black pantsula hat. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a case of assault was opened at the police station. He added: “It’s a criminal offence to impersonate police officers, and people have been arrested for that before.”
