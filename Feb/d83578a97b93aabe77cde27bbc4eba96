SOME political parties have applauded President Cyril Ramaphosa’s speech while others say he doesn’t have a plan. EFF leader Julius Malema said Ramaphosa had deviated from his previous promises and did not give an update on their progress. On the other hand, the DA said Ramaphosa had said all the right things – all he needed to do was implement. “After promising millions of jobs, now he says jobs must be provided by the private sector. In the manifesto of the ANC that gave him the presidency, he committed to creating jobs. Generally they have outsourced the responsibility of governing our people into the private sector. If you look at the approach of state-owned enterprises, it’s clear it is being outsourced,” said Malema. He added that Mzansi was under siege from crime, but Ramaphosa did not even mention any plan to deal with that. “Cash-in-transit and violent crimes as well as rape are taking place. No emphasis on how we are going to deal with them,” he said. DA leader John Steenhuisen said the message that Ramaphosa delivered was taken from their ideas. “The bulk of the president’s address could easily have been a DA speech, and he should be commended for at least saying some of the right things. However, he has made the right noises in the past too, only to go missing when they had to be implemented. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and so we caution all South Africans to hold the applause until these announcements become actions – if they ever do,” said Steenhuisen. Good Party secretary general Brett Herron said they agreed with some of the things Ramaphosa said, but wanted the government to support small businesses to fight unemployment. He said removing red tapes was not enough, but funding was crucial. “As someone who started a small business myself, the greatest barrier in starting it is access to finance,” he said. ANC’s Gwede Mantashe applauded Ramaphosa, saying the plan of action outlined was practical.
