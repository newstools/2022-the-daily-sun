I last saw him two weeks ago and he was with Bianca. He was his usual self; very happy and excited to see me. No one would have thought that it would be the last time I see him,” she said. She also said family and friends needed to love and support each other. “People talk, but we know who our son was. He was loving and caring. So when they talk, we should not be upset because this is our pain. We are crushed, but we are still standing.” Riky’s uncle Sfiso Msibi said the rapper was larger than life, and that they were going to miss him dearly. “We are grateful that he made us proud, and he ran his race,” he said.
