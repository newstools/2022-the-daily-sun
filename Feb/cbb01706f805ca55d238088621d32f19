FREE STATE cops arrested a suspect who had hijacked a vehicle at Majakathata Taxi Rank in Bloemfontein on Wednesday, 2 February. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane, it is alleged three male suspects approached the driver of a white Toyota Quantum at the taxi rank at about 4am and asked him if he was the owner. “As he was about to respond, one moved his hand to the waist as if he was pulling out a firearm. The driver jumped out of the vehicle and ran away. The suspect then drove off in the taxi, followed by the two others in a silver Toyota Corolla,” Covane said. He said the driver raised the alarm and people gave chase, following the hijacked Quantum. ALSO READ: COPS ARRESTED FOR FRAUD! “The police on patrol noticed the chase and joined in.
