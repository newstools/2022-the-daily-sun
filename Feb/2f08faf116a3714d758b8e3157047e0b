THINGS got heated in the Equality Court on Thursday 17 February when Julius Malema and AfriForum’s lawyer got into a heated personal debate. The EFF leader went as far as calling Advocate Mark Oppenheimer a bad lawyer in the Joburg court. ALSO READ | CALL THE COPS IF YOU SEE THIS MAN! The clash started during the cross-examination of Malema on Thursday 17 February. Speaking about his view that all farm owners were thieves because they stole land from black people, Malema said: “Your parents gave you a bad name.” Oppenheimer took offence as he felt the statement was directed at him. Malema then said he was talking about racist whites. Malema said: “So please, if you are going to be a legal representative, you are going to have to reduce yourself from this case as an individual. “Remove your emotions and deal with me as a professional. If you are going to come to me on a personal level, individually, I will not longer look at your as professional. I will decisively deal with you as an individual.” Oppenheimer said Malema was misrepresenting his statement. Malema then said the EFF’s struggles were not against individuals but a system that protected a minority. “Let’s stop daydreaming and listen to on another. I’m explaining the difference between an individual and the system and all you do is hallucinate. You are a bad lawyer, shame. It goes without saying,” he said. AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets has taken Malema and MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi for singing Dubul’ ibhunu, which means “kill the Boer”. Malema said the song was not a command to go and attack anyone. He said he was not moved by the trauma of farmers but by the trauma of black people who were forced to sing Die Stem while being tortured at Vlakplaas.
