ORLANDO Pirates got their Caf Confederation Cup group stages journey off to the best possible start as they bagged a comfortable home win in the first match. The Buccaneers defeated Algerian outfit JS Saoura 2-0 at the Orlando Stadium yesterday to ensure they start strong in their quest to win the continental trophy. Captain Happy Jele and wingback Bandile Shandu were on the scoresheet for Pirates, helping them get the better of their North African opponents. Jele, the Bucs skipper, was quickest to react to a rebound from the Saoura goalkeeper, displaying his killer instinct as he pounced to put his side ahead as early as the third minute. Shandu, who joined the Bucs at the beginning of the season from Maritzburg United, added to the scoresheet in the second to see his side coast to a comfortable win. Pirates, who are having somewhat of a below-par season by their standards so far, will be desperate for a decent run in the continental competition. Their chances of winning the league keep getting slimmer with every Mamelodi Sundowns win and they will target the Confederation Cup and the Nedbank Cup to bring a smile to their supporters’ faces. They are in the last-16 of the Ke Yona Cup and will be eager to clinch another continental title, their first since winning the Champions League some 27 years ago. The Soweto giants are now in a strong position in Group B after the result, perched atop the group standings with three points.
