FORMER Orlando Pirates defender, Rooi Mahamutsa said age is just a number and it doesn’t bother him. He has vowed to continue playing soccer for at least three more years or longer despite being 40 years old. He made an unbelievable comeback to competitive football two weeks ago when he made his debut for GladAfrica Championship strugglers TS Sporting in a 2-1 defeat to Swallows in their Nedbank Cup last-32 clash at Dobsonville Stadium. Mahamutsa said age doesn’t bother him and that’s why he continues playing football despite his age. He said he will continue playing as long his legs allow him to. He said: “You can play until the age of 45. It depends on how you keep your body and keep yourself away from negative things that will reduce your playing time.” Sporting have 13 games left in the Championship to save themselves from relegation. Mahamutsa said his presence in the team is to help the team get out of the relegation battle they are facing. Sporting are 15th in the standings. “My presence with the team is to help the young and senior players and for me gain more time in the team around the young ones,” said Mahamutsa. “I’m here to play football not to change anything that the team has been doing. There’s a bunch of great players here.” Mahamutsa now plays under the leadership of his former Bucs teammate Benson Mhlongo, who is Sporting’s coach. He said his relationship with Mhlongo started before they played together at Pirates. “I played with him and he knows my lifestyle. I knew him a long time ago before we started playing together,” added Mahamutsa.
