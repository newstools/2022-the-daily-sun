SA Football Association president Danny Jordaan in congratulating Banyana Banyana for qualifying for the African Women Cup of Nations (Awcon) finals in Morocco in June stressed the job is not done. Jordaan has made it clear what this qualification means, saying Banyana will have to qualify for the Fifa Women’s World Cup finals that will be held next year and hosted jointly by Australia and New Zealand. Banyana booked their spot in the Awcon finals after progressing 3-1 on aggregate against Algeria when they drew 1-1 at Stade Omar Hamadi on Wednesday in Algiers. Banyana won the home leg 2-0. Banyana will now be aiming at winning the Awcon for the first time. Jordaan said: “Congratulations to the head of delegation, coach Desiree Ellis and the team,” Jordaan told SunSport. “We are going to Awcon in Morocco to qualify for the World Cup and win it,” revealed Jordaan, who said the Safa are interested in hosting the Women’s World Cup in 2027. “The team showed courage and football intelligence. I have no doubt that this team will compete at the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Morocco.” In order to qualify for the 2023 World Cup finals, Banyana will have to reach the semifinals of the Awcon to be one of the four automatic qualifiers. Two more team will go into a continental play-off. Banyana qualified for the World Cup in France for the first time in 2019 when they finished runners up to Nigeria at the 2018 Awcon in Ghana.
