THE cool and trending Polo drivers are known to be notorious on the road. This is said to be encouraged by the comfort and quality performance of the car. But launching 2022 Polo models in Gqeberha this week, VW said responsible driving was its priority and public roads were not testing facilities where you could drive a car aggressively. The new Polo TSI and GTI do not only look great, but also perform wonders as you manoeuvre them. Whether driving around curves or on a straight road, the car is well-balanced and confident – leaving the driver to enjoy the good handling. The front design has LED headlights running across the whole area. In the GTI, you have a red line running along these lights, making it look awesome. The front bumper has fog lights, two on either side in the GTI.  VW said the fascinating LED light running across the front, that improves the appeal of the Polo, is made up of 24 lights closely put next to each other to give it quite an expressive front. The models include a 70kW manual, Life 1.0 TSI 70kW manual, Life 1.0 TSI 85kW DSG, R-Line 1.0 TSI 85kW DSG and Polo GTI 147kW DSG all made at People Pavilion VW Plant in Gqeberha. The Polo Life 1.0 TSI 85kW DSG comes standard with a digital dashboard display, park distance control (front and rear), electric folding mirrors, lumbar support for the driver and front passenger, a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel with shift paddles as well as 15-inch Essex alloy wheels.  The Polo R-Line 1.0 TSI 85kW DSG distinguishes itself from other versions by its striking “R” design. Above the standard features of the Polo Life, the R-Line comes with 16-inch Valencia alloy wheels, composition media infotainment system with inductive mobile charging and a two-zone climatronic air-conditioning system. The new Volkswagen Polo comes standard with a three-year/120 000km warranty, three-year/45 000km easy drive service plan and 12-year anti-corrosion warranty. The service interval is 15 000km. Customers have the option to extend easy drive maintenance and service plans up to 10 years/300 000km.
