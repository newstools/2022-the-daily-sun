THE Mpumalanga High Court sitting in Mbombela found “Masoyi Monster” guilty on all five counts of premeditated murder and defeating the ends of justice on Friday, 4 February. Julius Mndawe had been standing trial for killing Tokkie Tlaka (24), Banele Khoza (15), Noxolo Mdluli (17), Nomthandazo Mdluli (17) and Felicia Mndlovu (18) in Numbi trust between January 2018 and May 2019. On Tuesday, the accused had told the court through a written statement read by his lawyer, Ellana Erasmus, that he had arguments with all victims and assaulted them to death. He said when he realised that they were no longer breathing, he buried them in shallow graves because he knew that he was going to be in trouble for what he did. He stated that he never planned the killings, hence he told the police and even pointed out where he had buried them. The court found that the 28-year-old planned the murders. Handing down her judgement, acting judge Denise Greyling-Coetzer said all murders were committed in the house of the accused, where he stayed alone. She said the murders showed consistent cause of conduct – one selection of victims, which were young black women. “All coming to him at his homestead, one geographic area, the accused homestead within 20km from where they all reside. I am satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the totality of the evidence and facts is that the accused premeditated these murders. Applying thought of carrying it out and making sure that it was complete, and proceeding with his criminal act.” The case was postponed to Monday, 7 February, for sentencing.
