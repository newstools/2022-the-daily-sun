AN UNCLE and his nephew have become instant heroes in their community. They saved the lives of residents during floods at 77 Balfour Lake in Mamelodi, Tshwane, on Saturday, 5 February. According to community members, the duo risked their lives to save others. Bongani Madalane (27) and nephew Brighton Matsitela (19) told Daily Sun they used a rope to save them. “We were focused on saving people. We had to get them out of danger. “It wasn’t easy because of the broken concrete, zinc, wires and wood that were in the water,” said Bongani. Brighton said: “I never thought I would save lives one day. I was nervous, but hearing people scream gave me strength. I am happy they are all safe and reunited with their loved ones. We are proud to have saved more than 10 people from the floods.” Resident Vusi Ndou (43) said the water was scary, and he was happy to see people who cared about others lives and didn’t care to lose theirs. “What they did was courageous.” Another resident Mercy Moeti (29) said: “These men are true heroes. We are proud of their work.” Meanwhile, Tshwane emergency services said the number of fatalities recorded had risen to four. Deputy chief Charles Mabaso said cops recovered the body of a man on Sunday, 6 February, from a bakkie that was washed away in Centurion. He said cops also recovered the body of a man who allegedly drowned in his shack at Soul City squatter camp. The search for three victims, believed to have been washed away in Midstream, was still ongoing.
