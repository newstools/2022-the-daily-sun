A COMMUNITY has been left horrified by the brutal murder of an 85-year-old gogo. Gogo Charlotte Madolo was found dead at her home in Gugulethu, Cape Town, on Saturday, 19 February. Her daughter, Lindiwe Bovana told Daily Sun they were at a relative’s house to prepare for a funeral not far from their home when her mother was killed. She said a member of the family went home to fetch something and found the gogo tied to her bed with one of her eyes out. Captain Frederick van Wyk said a 48-year-old male was nabbed in connection with the gogo’s murder. He’s expected to appear in court once charged.
