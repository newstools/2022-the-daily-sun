VENDA Football Academy (VFA) have joined the other clubs in the Nedbank Cup last-16 stage, following their 3-1 win over ABC Motsepe League side African All Stars at Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday afternoon. Simiso Bophela and Rotondwa “Rama” Mutsivhuli’s brace in extra time proved to be enough to send VFA into the next round of the competition. The two teams were meeting for the first time ever in history. All Stars, coached by Themba Masango, former Sekhukhune United DStv Diski Challenge coach, were hoping for a change in luck to catch up and pull an upset, but it wasn’t to be. All Stars were first to find the back of the net in the 19th minute via a penalty kick, which was converted by Ngoanamello Rammala. However, they failed to manage the game and protect their lead as VFA were able to get an equaliser four minutes before half-time through Bophela, as they went on to the break tied on 1-1. In the second half, the two sides battled, and none of them were able to find a winning goal and the match had to go to extra time where it was decided. Mutsivhuli, who was introduced in the second half, scored his first of the match in the 107th minute to make it 2-1 in favour of VFA. Mutsivhuli completed his brace in the last minute of the match when he made it 3-1. VFA are joining the University of Pretoria, Mamelodi Sundowns, Swallows FC, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, and Orlando Pirates, who have already secured their spots in the last-16 round.
