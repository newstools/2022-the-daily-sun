A Premier League star Paul Pogba of Manchester United, recently posted a snippet on his social media account of him jamming Amapiano. The Man U star was listening to De Mthuda – John Wick feat. Sir Trill and Da Muziqal Chef. A post shared by Paul Labile Pogba (@paulpogba)  Jesse Lingard of Man U is another star listening to the South African genre. Lingard posted late last year on Instagram listening to Mr JazziQ’s ‘Amaneighbour.
