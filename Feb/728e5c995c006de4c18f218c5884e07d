FINANCE Minister Enoch Godongwana heeded calls from the Automobile Association (AA) not to raise the rate of fuel levies on Wednesday, 22 February. He also announced a “review of all aspects of the fuel price” in response to prolonged campaigns and a petition by the AA, calling into question perpetual fuel hikes. The AA had earlier urged the minister not to increase the two main levies on the fuel price, the general fuel and Road Accident Fund (RAF) levies. Currently these levies combined add R6,11 to every litre of fuel sold in the country. The AA urged the minister not to raise these levies as in previous years, claiming that such increases would be harmful to the economy, burdensome on the poor, and result in price increases for goods and services across the board, especially given that fuel prices are expected to hit new highs in March. “This is a landmark win for all consumers, not only motorists, and while fuel prices may still increase the additional burden of higher taxes is now out of the way. We are naturally extremely happy that our calls have been heeded,” said the AA. It said Godongwana’s announcement that he and Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe have agreed to review all aspects of the fuel price is an equally welcome development. “We launched an online petition which secured 35 000 signatures to urge government to #ReviewTheFuel and the fact that teams from the departments of Finance and Minerals and Energy are engaging to make this happen is great victory for consumers,” said the association. The AA said it will also engage government with a view to contribute to the fuel price review in any way it can, mindful that its inputs are motivated by promoting a0nd protecting consumer rights.
