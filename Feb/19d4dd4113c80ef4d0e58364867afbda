WHEN Prophet Mzwanele Molo dreamt about a shack on fire, he didn’t know it would come true. In the early hours of Tuesday, 8 February, just a week after the dream, he received a call to say his two sisters and their three children had died in a fire. Sergeant Linkie Lefakane of Bekkersdal Police Station in Gauteng said the fire happened at around 2am in Holomisa. “A neighbour said he was asleep when he heard the sound of a person screaming. He woke up to find the shack next door on fire. He tried to extinguish it but it was already too late,” he said. The five people who died were Nokuthula Hatonki (35) and Palesa (38), Sphamandla (17) and Sindiswa Molo (4) and a two-month-old baby who had not been named yet. Lefakane said Nokuthula and Sindiswa died in hospital after the fire. Mzwanele said they didn’t know what caused the fire. “We are really shocked and it’s not easy to stomach this. If I knew this was coming for my family, I would have prayed hard to stop it.” Family members said they didn’t know how they were going to pay for the burials because no one had a job. Police encouraged people to take safety precautions to prevent fires. These include not cooking near curtains, making sure stoves can’t fall over, checking for faulty electric connections, putting cigarettes out properly and not sleeping with candles or paraffin stoves on. Acting station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Andile Moshani sent his condolences to the family and friends of the victims.
