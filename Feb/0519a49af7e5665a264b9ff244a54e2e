ALTHOUGH Ntuthuko Shoba painted a rosy picture of his relationship with Tshegofatso Pule, her pregnancy threatened his official relationship. This was according to prosecutor Fagreh Mohammed, who told the High Court in Joburg on Wednesday, 16 February that the pregnancy was one of the reasons Shoba wanted to get rid of Pule. Shoba is accused of hiring Muzikayise Malephane to murder his eight-month-pregnant girlfriend, whose body was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Joburg in June 2020. “Shoba feared his fiancee would find out about the pregnancy and risked losing money that would be paid out from a life insurance policy,” said Mohammed. He said that Shoba portrayed Pule as a promiscuous woman in multiple relationships. “In your second affidavit in the lower court, you claimed Pule and Malephane had a romantic relationship and that the deceased wasn’t sure who the father of her unborn child was,” said Mohammed. “You claimed this angered Malephane and that was the motive for killing her, after you initially denied ever knowing Malephane.” He said Shoba failed to mention this detail while testifying in the High Court. Mohammed said that Shoba’s fiancee was due to receive R8 million from her late mother’s life insurance. On Tuesday, Shoba told the court his fiancee’s mother died in January 2020 and shortly after, he found out Pule was pregnant. He said he couldn’t tell his fiancee because she was already in pain.
