WHILE the Economic Freedom Fighter’s (EFF) “dubul’ ibhunu” civil case was being heard in the Equality Court on Wednesday, 9 February, two women entered singing the same song. They carried placards with the Azanian People’s Organisation emblem written “Dubul’ ibhunu is a struggle song about blackness” and “We will not stop singing to appease white fragility”. The court sitting in the South Gauteng High Court is to hear a complaint by AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets, that the song promotes the killing of white farmers. He wants the anti-apartheid song, that means “kill the boer”, declared hate speech and the court to order EFF and leaders Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi to apologise and pay for damages. Roets testified that as he was leaving the court on Tuesday, 8 February, EFF members protesting outside court blocked him. “They were singing and screaming things I don’t know. We stood there for a few minutes. We then started to push them out just to keep walking. Some started swearing and singing ‘kill the boer, kill the farmer’. At one stage, I turned around and one of them grabbed my phone,” he said, adding that he got it back after cops intervened. EFF member Lwandile Ngwenze told the court when Roets and his guards came out, they called them rascals and used Afrikaans words he did not understand. He said they responded by calling them racists. Ngwenze said Roets took out a phone and took a video of them, and a scuffle broke out. “No one was singing kill the boer. I heard people sing ‘kiss the boer’. And I was singing ‘kiss the boer’,” he said. The matter continues.
