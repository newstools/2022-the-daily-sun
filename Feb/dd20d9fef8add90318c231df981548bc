The government has encouraged people to create their own jobs, which is a good thing. Many have responded to the call by becoming street vendors to put food on the table. However, I find it odd that the corrupt Metro police use unfair municipal by-laws and exploit street vendors. They expect hawkers, who make about R300 a day, to have trading papers. If they don’t, they confiscate their stock and harass them. Those who don’t want their stock to be taken pay bribes. I’m glad that President Cyril Ramaphosa touched on this unfortunate issue during his State of the Nation Address. Many hawkers have stopped trading in the streets because they were left with nothing to take home. Shame on the selfish Metro cops who exploit the poor while they have salaries. Mamelodi East
