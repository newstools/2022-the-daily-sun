GOGO Barogelele Sibuyi (64) has no privacy in her tiny little house. She is sharing her one-room house in Rolle outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, with her son (25) and her grandson (22). “Imagine sharing this room without any privacy,” she said. “It’s not safe going to the toilet outside at night so we use a bucket.”  And when it rains, the roof leaks and the food she gets from Good Samaritans becomes wet. The gogo said she had been applying for an RDP house since 2013 without success. “I don’t know how many times sweet-tongued politicians and ward councillors have lied to me. They promise to build a house for us but it never happens,” she said. “One politician identified us as qualifying for a house, but later changed his plans. When I followed up, I was told I don’t qualify because I’m receiving a Sassa pension grant. My grandson is an orphan after his mum died but his foster grant money was cut off.” She said former ward councillor Million Makaringe eventually delivered bricks, promising to build her a house, but then he vanished. “People who came after me are sleeping in nice RDPs but I am still struggling,” she said. She said she was happy when Community Development worker John Makaringe came to the area. He confirmed the gogo’s application for an RDP. “During our visit to her home we identified that their living conditions were bad. We processed everything, but when we followed up with the Department of Human Settlements in 2020, the application was not yet approved.” He said they contributed money and bought cement and sand but her section now fell under a different ward. Bushbuckridge Municipality spokesman Claiton Khosa said: “We are investigating and will get back to her.”
