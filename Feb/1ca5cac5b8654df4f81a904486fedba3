ACTING Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will not shy away from making unfavourable findings against President Cyril Ramaphosa if there is evidence to do so. Speaking during the Judicial Service Commission interviews for the chief justice position on Friday, 4 February, he said as a judge, he would always do his job properly. “I will not make findings against anybody if there’s no evidence. But, I will make findings against anybody if there’s evidence. If I must suffer any consequences for that, it’s fine,” said Zondo. He dismissed allegations that he was pro-Ramaphosa and anti-Jacob Zuma. “I don’t think they place any facts to what they are saying. It’s just perceptions. I’m not pro- or anti-anybody.” He added that he knew on the day he agreed to chair the state capture commission that he would make enemies. “I was number two in the judiciary. I was deputy chief justice. There was no way I could run away from the responsibility. I knew it was going to be difficult and that I would make a lot of enemies if I did this job properly, but I accepted that it was a job to be done. And if I made enemies for myself in trying to help the country, so be it.” He said there was a need for protection of whistle-blowers and investigative journalists in Mzansi. He said the work of the commission would have been much more difficult had it not been for them. “I strongly believe if we are going to have any chance of making a dent on corruption, we must protect whistle-blowers because those are the people, together with investigative journalists, who really give us information.”
