ANGRY residents moered a man accused of raping a young girl and demolished his shack on Saturday, 5 February. This happened in NY89 in Gugulethu, Cape Town, after the man (46) was accused of raping an 11-year-old girl. CPF secretary Nokwanda Mkongi told Daily Sun they were shocked to learn about the incident. Nokwanda said the man had allegedly been raping the girl since November last year and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. He allegedly gave her money every time he raped her. Nokwanda said the matter came to light after a neighbour of the suspect overheard a conversation where another person told the suspect he’d be arrested because of the girl. The concerned neighbour investigated and found that the girl often visited the man’s house. The neighbour reported the matter to the community and the girl was tracked down. She then opened up about what has been happening. The residents burnt the suspect’s shack. He managed to flee but he was later caught and moered before escaping again. The 51-year-old mum of the victim, who lives with a disability, said she wanted the suspect to rot in jail. “How can someone do this to an 11-year-old child? There’s no relationship here. It was rape. Nothing else!” she said. The suspect’s brother said he was shocked and had no idea his brother was raping a child. He said the suspect was a security guard and worked at night, so he was home alone during the day. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said a rape case was being investigated. But the suspect has not been arrested yet.
