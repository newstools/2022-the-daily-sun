IT has ended in tears for Mzansi's first smartphone, Mara. The factory is going on the action just over two years after its launch. Mara Phones Global CEO Chris Corsi said on Wednesday, 9 February, that the Covid-19 pandemic affected their business in South Africa, like any other countries in the world. “Unfortunately, the lack of uptake in the South African domestic market coupled with a shortfall in tender materialisation and lockdowns has prompted this course of action,” said Corsi.

The company's assembly plant for the affordable smartphones in Inanda, outside Durban, was opened by President Cyril Ramaphosa in October 2019 using half of R1.5 billion in funding from Standard Bank and the Industrial Development Corporation. Business Insider reported that the Auction documents have revealed that the plant and its contents are being sold — lock, stock, and barrel. The auction lot includes the plant, manufacturing and testing equipment, smartphone components, and the completed phones kept in its storage facilities. “The line is in very good condition and could be reworked to make other electronic components,” said the auctioneers. Corsi could not say if they will import phones to South Africa. Mara had models such as the Mara X, Mara Z, and Mara S. The company did not reveal what would happen to its factory workers and those at its experience store in Maponya Mall in Soweto.
