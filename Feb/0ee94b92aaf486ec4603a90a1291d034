A MANHUNT has been launched for a man who shot dead his lover and attempted to kill her brother outside a pub in Standerton, Mpumalanga, Sunday, 30 January. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said: “An argument started at about 8.20pm between a man and his girlfriend at a pub. The two are said to have then went outside where the man who was armed apparently shot the woman. It is further said that another man believed to be the brother of the woman tried to intervene after the shooting. But he too was shot by the suspect on the lower body. The suspect then fled the scene on foot, leaving behind his vehicle at the scene.” Mohlala said the brother reportedly drove with the woman to seek medical assistance but unfortunately she succumbed to her injuries upon arrival at the hospital. The man was treated for his injuries in the same hospital and later discharged. Police were informed about the incident where a case of murder with an additional charge of attempted murder was opened. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has strongly condemned this horrendous act. “These accidents where women are murdered by partners or ex-partners are very disturbing. We cannot allow such violent acts to prevail. The suspect must be hunted, arrested, and brought to book to face the full might of the law,” she said. An investigation is underway and police request Jan Mofokeng to come forth as soon as possible as they believe he can be of assistance in their probe. Members of the public who can assist the police in their investigation are urged to alert the police immediately, or contact Detective Sergeant Oupa Radebe on 063 4457 885 or call the CrimeStop number on 08600 10111 or send information via MYSAPSAPP, and all received information will be treated as confidential.
