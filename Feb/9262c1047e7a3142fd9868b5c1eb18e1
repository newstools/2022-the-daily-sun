JUDGMENT in the trial of Ntuthuko Shoba has been reserved by the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg. The court will issue a notice about the date of the judgment. The trial, which sat for four weeks, resumed on Tuesday, 22 February for closing arguments. Shoba is accused of being the mastermind in the murder of his eight-months pregnant girlfriend, Tshegofatso Pule. State prosecutor Fagreh Mohammed told the court his arguments were based on three factors – the confession Muzikayise Malephane made before the start of his trial in 2020, cellphone records and car track evidence. “We cannot ignore the fact that when Malephane was tasked to fetch Pule after her ‘interview’ on the 29th, he received calls from the disputed number,” said Mohammed. Malephane previously told the court that when he couldn’t reach Shoba on his registered number, he called him on the disputed number. Mohammed explained that the pattern of the calls revealed the number was used by Shoba. Shoba maintained he only contacted Malephane when he wanted to buy cigarettes from him. However, two witnesses called by his defence couldn’t corroborate this fact. Shoba’s defence lawyer Advocate Norman Makhubela maintained that Malephane should be discredited as a witness. But acting judge Stuart Wilson said if that were the case, he would have to dismiss the matter as the state built its case based on Malephane’s confession. Shoba, who seemed to be in high spirits when the court adjourned, thanked his legal team saying: “This was a stretch.” He also spoke to his father asking him if he was okay.
