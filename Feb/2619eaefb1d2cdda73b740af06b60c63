SEWELA Nong believes her life and that of her family are in danger. This is after a fire started in her sitting room in Kwena Moloto outside Polokwane, Limpopo, on Wednesday, 9 February. The 34-year-old told Daily Sun her son (14) noticed the fire and tried to put it out. But the flames were too strong. Sewela said the fire was extinguished after hours, but it had not spread to other rooms. “I was fortunate that my son was able to help rescue his five siblings. Their grandfather (95) also escaped unharmed.” She suspected that the fire was started by someone. “An electrician found nothing wrong. There was no way the fire started by itself, hence I suspect someone,” she said, estimating the damage at R10 000. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they were investigating malicious damage to property. “No one has been arrested and investigations continue.”
