SANGOMA Mavusi Gqola was overjoyed to finally get his cellphone back after it was taken by cops last May. The sangoma from Mfuleni in Cape Town said they took his Samsung S20 to investigate the people threatening him. To his shock, the cops kept it for months. Daily Sun published his story on 21 January and the phone was finally returned on Friday, 11 February. “I want to thank the SunTeam for intervening because I’ve been asking for the phone for a long time. “But I’m not happy with how this was handled. “Despite them keeping my phone for a long time, nobody was arrested.” Mavusi said he recently finished making the payments for his phone, which cost him R30 000. “Can you imagine paying this amount for a phone you are not even using. I was not impressed by what the cops did,” he said. Captain Frederick van Wyk said the phone was sent back to Mfuleni cop shop at the end of last year. “It was sent to the operational command centre to download the necessary information that would form part of the investigation. The phone was sent back to the investigating officer late last year, while the docket was sent to the senior state prosecutor for a decision. “The investigation is still ongoing.”
