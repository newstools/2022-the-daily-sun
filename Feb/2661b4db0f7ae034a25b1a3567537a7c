A WOMAN, who is four months pregnant, said she was attacked on Saturday, 19 February by a man she was chilling with after she asked him about a bottle of beer. The 21-year-old from Amalinda Forest in East London, Eastern Cape, said: “We were drinking together and I noticed that a beer is missing. So my sin was asking him where it is and we exchanged words,” she said. She said she let go of the issue because they knew one another, but found the suspect waiting outside. “The tavern was closed. While on my way home, I saw him waiting for me, so I decided to change direction and walked faster to his house,” she said. When she got there, she reported what happened to his family, but the suspect arrived and allegedly beat her up with an empty beer bottle. “He then started to stab me (with the bottle). I had to do everything to protect my child, so he ended up stabbing me on my face, breasts, shoulder, hands and arms.” The woman believes the man’s intention was to kill her unborn baby. “I cannot believe he is capable of doing something like this to a pregnant woman,” she said. She said she has opened a case. Resident Nozuko Mabhovana (45) said: “With all the things that have been happening to women and children, I believe God has forgotten about us.” Police spokesman Warren Officer Majola Nkohli said a case of assault has been opened and no one has been arrested.
