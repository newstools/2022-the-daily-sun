With recent
reports of typhoid fever spreading through various provinces in South Africa,
many South Africans are asking, how safe is our water? Although purchasing
bottled water to be used for drinking and cooking may seem like the best idea,
rather look to the baby aisle of your supermarket and purchase a box of Milton
tablets or a bottle of Milton fluid. “Many moms
are familiar with Milton as a trusted sterilising agent when it comes to
keeping their baby’s bottles and utensils free from germs,” explains Mario
Correia, brand manager for Milton. “But one of the other uses of this multi-purpose
product is to sterilise water.” Milton
products protect against 99.9% germs, and this includes bacteria associated
with water-borne disease. Using the tablets or the fluid is no hassle: “Available
in a box containing 32-tablets or in a 1litre, 500ml or 200ml bottle, Milton
will be able to provide each household with plenty of safe drinking water
during this time,” comments Correia. Typhoid
fever is a bacterial infection that can be caused by drinking contaminated
water. It can spread through the body, affecting many of the body’s organs. If
not treated quickly it can cause serious complications and can be fatal. If
symptoms are severe and persists consult a medical professional.
