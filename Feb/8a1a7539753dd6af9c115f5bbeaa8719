THE Mahlake family blames the cops and Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for their loved one’s death. This comes after Boyiki (51) from Saselani outside Dwarsloop, Mpumalanga, was allegedly run over by Calcutta cops in Nkanini outside Marite on 10 November. They said cops didn’t inform them about the incident, but took Boyiki’s body to a mortuary and conducted a post-mortem. Mum Salphina Sekatane (85) told Daily Sun they were shocked when Ipid officials arrived at her home on 18 November, saying Boyiki died after being knocked down by a police van. “They said they discovered his clinic card in his pocket.  “They said the police had done a post-mortem and we could bury him. They never bothered to help us with his burial. We reported Boyiki missing in October after he vanished while visiting relatives in Sabi. He and his brother were my last hope. “My three other kids died years ago.” Boyiki’s brother, Freddy, (54) said they asked for the postmortem report and case docket, but were not helped. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the docket was taken to Ipid. Spokeswoman Grace Langa said they investigated and the case was completed as undetected, as no cops were positively identified by either the complainant or the alleged witnesses. “Correspondence was also sent to the complainant via mail. The medical report did support minor injuries that may be from the alleged incident but without identification, no one was charged.”
