ORLANDO Pirates have moved quickly to extend their option to extend star striker Gabadinho Mhango contract, according to the player’s agent Mike Makaab. The striker signed a contract with Bucs at the beginning of the 2019-20 season and it was due to lapse at the end of the season, but there was an option for the club to renew. Pirates have now exercised that option, which will see the Malawian star remain in the boat until end of the 2022-23 season. “Pirates have exercised Mhango’s option,” confirmed Makaab on Gagasi FM. It has been an underwhelming domestic season for the 29-year-old Mhango, who in the first half of the season made only six appearances in all competitions without scoring. However, the former Golden Arrows and Bloemfontein Celtic striker was the heartbeat of his country Malawi in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals in Cameroon. Mhango is one of the Afcon’s top scorers, netting three times before The Flames were bundled out of the competition by Morocco in the round of 16, becoming the all-time leading goal scorer for Malawi in the biennial competition. Mhango scored what will be one of the contenders for the goal of the tournament against Morocco. However, that wasn’t enough as Morocco edged Malawi 2-1. Mhango’s other two goals came in the group stages against Zimbabwe. After the striker turned heads with those brilliant displays in the Afcon, Makaab said there has been interest in the player from clubs in Asia and the United States. However, Makaab added: “But right now we just have to wait and see what happens at the end of the season.” Mhango, since he joined Bucs, helped the Soweto giants win the MTN8 trophy last season. He has scored 23 goals in 67 matches, including 16 in the league in his first season with Pirates to share the league’s golden boot award with Mamelodi Sundowns’ Peter Shalulile.
