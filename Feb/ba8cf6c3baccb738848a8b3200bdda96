DJ HLO said she hates it when people tell lies about her relationship status. The artist, who won SABC Song of the Year, cleared rumours that she was in a relationship with Durban businessman Dr Musa Zulu. The rumours were spread on social media as the two were often seen together. She said she had no other relationship with him except for work. “Musa and I have a working relationship. That’s why we are always together. We’re not in a romantic relationship,” said DJ Hlo.

People must stop spreading rumours. And some people think they’re entitled to discuss other people’s private affairs. That’s not right,” said DJ Hlo, whose real name is Hlosiwe Mthalane. Businessman Musa laughed off the rumours, insisting that they only had a working relationship.
