MZANSI’S power utility Eskom has announced that it will be implementing stage 2 load shedding on Wednesday, February. The utility says this follows further breakdowns during the night, and Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented starting at 11:00 on Wednesday until 05:00 on Monday. “Eskom regrets to inform the public that Stage 2 load shedding wit be implemented from 11 00 this morning until 05.00 on Monday. This load shedding is necessary due to a shortage of generation capacity following breakdowns of two more generating units during the night,” Eskom said in a statement. Eskom says since the weekend it has utilised significant amounts of emergency generating reserves, which have now been depleted and need to be replenished. It further said it will use this period of load shedding to replenish the emergency generation reserves. “A unit each at Kusile and Kendal power stations tripped. Delays in returning units at Kusile, Tutuka, Duvha, Lethabo, and Grootvlei have also contributed to the current supply constraints,” Eskom said.
