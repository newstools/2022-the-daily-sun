IT’S been almost three weeks since a little boy went missing. And, his disappearance still remains a mystery to his mum. Lusakhanya Mkhize (2) from KwaMagwaza, KZN, vanished on 28 January while playing at a neighbour’s house. Nonto Mkhize (25) said she was worried about her son. She said he went to play at the neighbour’s house as he normally did. “I went to look for him when it started to get dark, but he wasn’t there. The neighbour said she had no idea where he went. She told me she last saw him playing with other kids outside her house,” she said. She said the kids didn’t see where he went to. “We searched in the area and nearby bushes, but there was no sign of him,” she said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Lusakhanya was last seen in a navy vest, blue cargo pants and navy sandals. “We appeal to anyone with information to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111,” said Mbele.
