AMAPIANO sisters TxC (Tarryn and Clair) have received backlash on social media for their rider. It was shared by a Facebook user who was making fun of their demands. The duo is popularly known for dancing during their sets. One their long list of demands, they demanded that no amapiano music is played before they get there because they will play it when they arrive. That made people upset, they said they are ridiculous for asking that and are calling them divas. Another demand that made people upset was that they want to be escorted by security guards.

They must just quit djing if abafuni,” he wrote. Facebook user Percy Maleto wrote: “They are undermining the promoter or organiser. For an example if it was DJ Shimza or Maphorisa or others on same level booking them they were not gonna demand. They can’t even produce. Bro just book talent not beauty,” he wrote. Lungelo MVp Yili said he would’ve rejected the rider. “Akakho serious lomntu. Good thing ndaphuma kwi events. I’d reject this rider,” he wrote. Musiq Works wrote: “They just worried that DJs before them will play popular tracks.” Another user Thembelihle Maseko said their demands aredisrespectful. “I always find it disrespectful to do such. In most cases, a recording artist/DJ is booked to perform their music bese wena uyaphapha,” he wrote.
