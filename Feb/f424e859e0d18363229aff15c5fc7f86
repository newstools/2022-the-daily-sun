RESIDENTS of Vaalbank near Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga, said the service at the local clinic is very slow as it’s short-staffed. Resident Bangi Msiza said he’d arrived at the clinic at 8am, but only got help at 2pm. He told Daily Sun when patients complain about service, nurses tell them to complain to the department. “A nurse told us she’s happy we are realising the situation. She told us there’s nothing she can do as she was all alone.” Another resident Portia Mthombeni (38) said some people preferred to travel far to Allemansdrift Clinic. “The service in our clinic is very poor. There are no nurses. Every time I go there, I find the same nurses. Patients are forced to wait for long hours.”  Gogo Johannah Mahlomuza (73) said she waited for long time before getting medication. “I wait for hours until I become hungry. I am forced to carry a lunch box because I don’t have money to travel to Allemansdrift Clinic. I sleep on the benches waiting for help.” Residents wanted the clinic to be upgraded and to operate 24 hours a day instead of eight, saying at night they have nowhere to go. Department of health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said there was no shortage of nurses at the clinic. “There are challenges we are addressing. According to the patient experience survey, the waiting time at Vaalbank is within the norm compared to the national waiting time of three hours. Clients preferring Allemansdrift might differ, based on individual’s experience.”
