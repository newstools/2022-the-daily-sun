In 2016, Godfrey founded a beauty pageant called Mr & Miss Albinism South Africa, a first of its kind in the country. And, Kuli had never been shy to make her stance known for advocating for people living with albinism. “She was one of the people who was dedicated to fighting against the rights and killings of persons with albinism. She did so with confidence and was never ashamed to speak out,” he said. Godfrey said the most important thing about the pageant was creating awareness.  Godfrey further said Kuli’s death came at the time when they were looking at appointing her as one of the judges for their next crowning this year. “Kuli, you’ve run your race and we are indeed lost as most people still need to be educated about albinism. We will continue the fight and always remember the lionesses you were.”
