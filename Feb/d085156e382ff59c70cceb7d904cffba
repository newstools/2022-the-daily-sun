REDUCING debt and balancing social spending will be the focus areas when Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana tables his maiden budget on Wednesday, 23 February. Godongwana will be delivering his budget at a time when the country’s unemployment rate has reached record highs, the economy is still reeling from Covid-19 and load-shedding continues to wreak havoc. In his last budget speech, former minister Tito Mboweni warned that government debt was spiraling, with the state borrowing R2,1 billion a day. Despite this, the government was recently granted an emergency pandemic relief loan of R65 billion from the International Monetary Fund. Godongwana will have to explain how this money will be paid back while the government reportedly plans to turn the R350 pandemic grants into a permanent grant. With many people having lost their jobs, it will be interesting to see how much Godongwana expects the South African Revenue Service to collect through income tax. The question is whether Godongwana can table a budget that will lead to economic growth and job creation. The DA argues this can be done by managing expenditure to pay off debt and attracting investment.
