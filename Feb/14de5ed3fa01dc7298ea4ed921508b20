BANYANA Banyana defender Lebogang Ramalepe says they have put themselves under immense pressure ahead of their Africa Women’s Cup of Nation (Awcon) second leg qualifier against Algeria on Wednesday. On Friday, Banyana defeated Algeria 2-0 at Orlando Stadium in the first leg. Hilda Magaia and Thembi Kgatlana were both on the scoresheet to put Banyana 90 minutes away from qualifying for the Awcon, which will be hosted by Cameroon from 2-23 July. A draw or victory in Algiers will ensure Banyana are among the 12 teams that will battle it out to win Africa’s crown in Morocco. Ramalepe said they should have scored more goals to be on the safe side in Algeria. She believes the 2-0 lead is not enough. “We knew what we had to do, I am happy with the performance but we have to pull up our socks and do better in the second leg,” Ramalepe said. “The goals we rescored were not It’s not enough. We have put ourselves under unnecessary pressure with the less goals we scored at home. That now means we have to make sure that we go hard on them in Algeria and score first while trying our best to keep clean sheet.” Banyana left the country on Saturday evening to Algeria. Ramalepe said the players know the importance of the second leg. She added: “This is very important for us, we know we missed the Olympics now we cannot mess up this one. We have to win in Algeria to qualifying for Awcon to keep our World Cup dream alive.” Banyana coach Desiree Ellis who was also not satisfied with the two goals they scored, said in Algeria it could be a different ball game they will need to be on their toes and score first. Ellis said: “The tie is not over and we have to make sure we do not conceded because they might come to us. I  think Algeria will be a different side at home, but we need to keep a clean sheet and score first. I think that would kill of the tie.
