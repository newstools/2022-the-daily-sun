A suspected
house robber has been killed during a shootout with Johannesburg police. Three other
suspects were arrested on Monday at around 12:30 following a high-speed car
chase. The armed
suspects had allegedly attempted to rob a home in Parkwood. A scuffle broke out
between the robbers and the homeowner, and the robbers allegedly shot and wounded
the homeowner, said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo. Police
officers and security guards in the area heard gunshots and responded. "[The]
suspects started shooting at the officers as they were approaching. A shootout
and high-speed chase ensued, resulting in one suspect being fatally wounded and
three suspects being arrested," said Masondo. "Police
recovered three unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Preliminary investigations
revealed that the car used by the suspects was fitted with false registration
plates and was... hijacked in the Brackendowns precinct last year,"
Masondo added. The
firearms will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if they are linked to
other crimes "The
arrested suspects will be charged with attempted house robbery, attempted
murder, possession of a hijacked vehicle and possession of unlicensed firearms
and ammunition. They are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's
Court on Tuesday," said Masondo. SOURCE:
