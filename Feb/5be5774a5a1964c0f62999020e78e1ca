A WOMAN suspected to be behind a spate of break-ins in the City of Joburg offices has been arrested. She was caught red-handed inside the IEC offices in Braamfontein in the early hours of Monday, 7 February. The woman was allegedly found in possession of the city’s computer hard drives and other computer tools. Joburg mayor Mpho Phalatse said she was woken up at 2am to be informed that a suspect was caught with the city’s stolen goods. “I’m here with member of mayoral committee David Tembe at the metro centre where we have had yet another break-in by a suspect who is allegedly linked to three previous incidents. Our security officers found hard drives, data chips and other tools in a bag which allegedly belongs to her,” she said.  On 24 January, the same woman was allegedly caught on closed-circuit television cameras after she broke into two city’s departments. About 50 computers were tempered with and hard drives were stolen. “We were not clear at the time what the motive was. This is a person who seems to be a repeat offender. We are hoping justice will prevail this time around,” said Phalatse. The woman was arrested in October 2020 for a similar crime but the case was thrown out of court because of lack of evidence. JMPD spokesma Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “A swift response by JMPD security personnel, the Integrated Intelligence Operations Centre undercover unit led to the arrest of one suspect who broke into the Metro Centre in Braamfontein. Computer hard drives, memory cards, processors, break in implements and voter management device were allegedly found in her possession.”
