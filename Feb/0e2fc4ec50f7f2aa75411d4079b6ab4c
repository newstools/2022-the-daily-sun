Dear MizzB MY girlfriend insists we continue using condoms but I am tired of it. I want to show her I am truly committed to her by hitting it raw. How do I convince her to agree? ) Bradas Dear Bradas Honesty and transparency is key to good communication in relationships. Having unprotected sex doesn’t, in any way, show commitment or love to your partner. Your partner is playing it safe by having protected sex. This is a smart move as it protects both of you from sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies. Each partner has the right to choose and decide how the relationship should be run. Find common ground with your girlfriend and remember her opinion matters too. All the best!
