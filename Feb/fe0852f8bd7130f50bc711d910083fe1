KAIZER Chiefs star Njabulo Blom does not mind which position he plays for Amakhosi.And he is not worried that it could affect his place in Bafana Bafana.Blom (22) is a regular for the Soweto giants since he graduated from the reserve league structures two seasons ago.He played as a right-back in the first half of the season and his performance caught the attention of the national team selectors.This has earned him a call-up to Bafana.In the past two games the youngster played midfield. And he is not worried that could affect his chances to play for the national team.“In the development structures, while working with coach Arthur Zwane, he told me I should not limit myself as a player,” said Blom.“I should be versatile and play in different positions. Coach Stuart Baxter said he saw me play in midfield and wanted me to play in the middle for the benefit of the team.“I played right back in the reserve league, and am comfortable with both positions,” he said.“This allows me to grow, make mistakes and work hard. The coaches motivate young players to keep their feet on the ground."
