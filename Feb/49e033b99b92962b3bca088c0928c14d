IT IS often said that true beauty lies in the natural essence of anything. In other words, anything that comes in its original or natural state is often a sight to behold. This is often the case when the debate of a woman’s natural or extensional hair comes up. While both form a beautiful crown, the preference for men also forms part of the ongoing debate. According to social circles, many men seem to prefer women with natural hair. Why is this the case? According to hair magazine Private Label, men are often physically attracted to women for a multitude of reasons, including hair. According to the publication, most men enjoy the Afro-puffed and silky naturally relaxed hair. Apparently, this showcases the true beauty of a woman, and men love and appreciate it. AFROPUNK magazine highlights the role media plays in the negative perception of natural hair, especially among black women. The perception has always been that extensions and wigs are what makes women beautiful, and natural hair has always been seen as left of the spectrum. AFROPUNK further explains that men from various racial backgrounds find natural hair on black women to be sexy, workplace-professional and internationally appealing. https://curlsunderstood.com also adds that men love women with natural hair because they can touch and get it wet in the pool or at the beach.
