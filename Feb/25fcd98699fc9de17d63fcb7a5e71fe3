Cape Town City bolstered their chances of cementing a top-eight finish ahead of what promises to be a thrilling race to the end of the DStv Premiership campaign. They edged Golden Arrows 1-0 at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday, thanks to a second half strike from talented winger Khanyisa Mayo. The Citizens, who moved into the top-eight thanks to the result, have now completed a double over Lehlohonolo Seema’s Arrows. Seema’a charges were hoping to avenge a painful 4-3 defeat at the hands of the Citizens in the first round away from home. Tinkler’s charges blitzed Abafana Bes’Thende, romping to a 4-0 lead before the hour mark but Seema’s side were able to put some respectability to the scoreline. Abafana Bes'thende came into the encounter on the back of a goalless draw with Orlando Pirates midweek, their 10th of the season overall. It was also the fourth game in a row that they had only picked up a solitary point, however, but the Citizens ensured that the KZN side walked away empty handed this time around. The Citizens also came into the clash on the back of a goalless draw against Kaizer Chiefs in midweek, a result that pleased Tinkler. They were confident having only lost one of their last ten matches, a run of form that they will hope to maintain going forward. The Citizens next face Sekhukhune United after a healthy break while Arrows face Maritzburg United in a KZN derby on Friday at the Harry Gwala Stadium. Seema’s side are still in the race for a top-eight finish but they now have little room for error if they are to fulfil their ambition.
