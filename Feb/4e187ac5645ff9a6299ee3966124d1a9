THE man (25) who allegedly killed his girlfriend, Busi Sambo (20), appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday, 23 February. Silence Tivane has not yet been asked to plead for allegedly killing Busi, the mother of his two-year-old daughter. His lawyer Tshembo Mbhalati said he needed time to consult with his client before proceeding with a bail application. Fuming residents, joined by Economic Freedom Fighters and African National Congress members, came out in support of Sambo’s family. Family spokesman Jabulani Mnisi said Sambo was laid to rest last Tuesday in Mganduzweni outside White River. “This man is heartless. He has been abusive towards her for a long time until he robbed her of her life after being served with a protection order. He stabbed her repeatedly before slitting her throat like a goat, and dumping her body in the nearby bushes.” Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the suspect was arrested by Calcutta police. He said cops were informed by schoolchildren about the body near the Chayaza High School. “The clothes the woman was wearing were covered in blood, and she was certified dead on the scene. Police launched a manhunt that led to Silence,” he said. “They also found clothing with blood stains where they arrested the suspect. Investigators also seized an item, believed to be the weapon used in the murder.” The case was postponed to 2 March for a formal bail application.
