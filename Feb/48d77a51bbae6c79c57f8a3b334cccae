THE treatment of hair has vastly one of the most important aspects of fashion. Deemed the human crown, hair is indeed the first impression one creates upon the first interaction. People then go on to form an opinion on how you looked based on the impression you made, hence hair plays an important role in one’s overall image. This is also evident in pubic hair, especially with women. Women who wax their punani have also invested in styling that hair. According to Durex, this forms an important part of body positivity and confidence. Durex further explains that more women have begun to invest in styling their punani hair. So, if you are looking at doing this, Durex recommends the following hairstyles: 1. Hollywood Wax Also known as the sphinx, this is the queen of all waxes. A Hollywood wax is not recommended for a wax virgin as it involves removing all the pubic hair around the pubis and anal area to leave behind a completely blank canvas. 2. Brazilian Wax The widely popular Brazilian wax is like a Hollywood, but with a little bit of hair left at the front of the pubic mound. Pubic hair is waxed into a thin strip or small triangle and removed from two to three finger-widths above the vulva. This is a good option if you want something in the middle as it keeps some of your natural hair but maintains the order. 3. Landing Strip This is where the pubic hair is waxed to the same width as your natural fold or slightly thinner. It can resemble a Brazilian, but the main difference is that the labia and hair along the bum crack remain untouched. This is great if you love the minimalist look but don’t want to go all out. 4. Bermuda Triangle Also known as the American or classic bikini, this involves removing only the pubic hair that would be exposed by a bikini and is great for a pre-holiday tidy up. The hair at the top of the thighs and under the navel can also be removed if necessary.
