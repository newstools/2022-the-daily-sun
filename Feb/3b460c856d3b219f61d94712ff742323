 IN the world of modern soccer, two giant names stand out – Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. As the most talented and marketable players in the world, it is unsurprising that they top the list of highest-earning soccer players by the end of last year. Cristiano Ronaldo just edged out his rival in the 2021 rankings, earning $70 million (just over R1 billion) through his salary and bonuses and a further $55m (R829 305 950) in endorsements. RONALDO’S HOMECOMING The Portuguese star, Cristiano Ronaldo, has had a long and illustrious career, which came full circle last year when he returned to the club where he first made his name, Manchester United. With 135 goals as of 2021, the forward is the all-time top scorer in the Uefa Champions League since 1955. Ronaldo spent the height of his career at Real Madrid, one of the most valuable European soccer teams. The Madrid-based team have the most titles in the Champions League, taking home the trophy four out of five times between 2013 and 2018. However, having won everything imaginable at Real Madrid, Ronaldo sought a new challenge in 2018 and transferred to Juventus to try his luck in the Italian Serie A. After three years in Italy, where he won the Serie A title twice, as well as the Coppa Italia, Ronaldo made the switch back to Manchester ahead of the 2021-22 season. MESSI’S EUROPEAN DOMINANCE The list of Lionel Messi’s personal and club achievements is almost endless. Since his debut back in 2004, the diminutive attacker played over 750 matches for Barcelona and scored at a rate of almost one goal every game. He has also won the Ballon d’Or/FIFA Ballon d’Or award – the most prestigious award in soccer – a total of five times. Messi led FC Barcelona to four of their five total Uefa Champions League titles, and a staggering 10 domestic league titles. Barcelona is one of the most valuable sports team brands in the world, valued at over four billion U.S. dollars. However, following months of speculation, Messi finally left his boyhood club in 2021 to seek a new challenge at French champions Paris-Saint Germain. – statista.com Cristiano Ronaldo Annual: R542 473 427 Monthly: R45 206 118 Weekly: R10 432 181 Daily: R2 086 436 Lionel Messi Annual: R618 284 287 Monthly: R51 523 690 Weekly: R11 890 082 Daily: R2 378 016 Neymar Annual: R1 432 609 934 Monthly: R119 384 161 Weekly: R27 550 191 Daily: R5 510 038 Kelian Mbappe Annual: R485 050 546 Monthly: R40 420 878 Weekly: R9 327 895 Daily: R1 865 579 Mohamed Salah Annual: R566 824 415 Monthly: R47 235 367 Weekly: R10 900 469 Daily: R2 180 093 Robert Lewandowski Annual: R334 066 239 Monthly: R27 838 853 Weekly: R6 424 350 Daily: R1 284 870 Andres Iniesta Annual: R512 723 555 Monthly: R42 726 962 Weekly: R9 860 068 Daily: R1 972 013 Paul Pogba Annual: R308 203 207 Monthly: R25 683 600 Weekly: R5 926 984 Daily: R1 185 396 Gareth Bale Annual: R481 911 964 Monthly: R40 159 330 Weekly: R9 267 537 Daily: R1 853 507 Eden Hazard Annual: R481 383 260 Monthly: R40 115 271 Weekly: R9 257 370 Daily: R1 851 474 Credit: mywage.co.za
