MDUDUZI Mabaso says his DiepCity character Mgedeza’s struggles can spark an important dialogue. The character recently learnt that he was infertile and the baby he was raising was not his. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mduduzi said: “Playing Mgedeza is emotional and challenging because a lot of men are facing the same predicament. “The story is a reflection of our society and directly talks to gender-based violence. When I was presented with this storyline, I felt these were conversations we should be having.” The actor said playing Mgedeza is a walk in the park. “In real life, I know men who are raising children that are not theirs. When the truth comes out, consequences can be deadly. I wish society could learn from the storyline,” he said. ALSO READ : MANTSOE POUT LEAVES STAR FM!
