Mamelodi Sundowns have paved the way for new signing, Bolivian Erwin Saavedra, by sacrificing Brazilian Ricardo Nascimento, as they balance their required foreign quota. SunSport has it on good authority that Nascimento is no longer training with the club, polishing way for incoming 25-year-old Saavedra who hails from Ururo. The South American is confirmed as a Sundowns player, even his club Bolívar FC have already bid their farewell to the player. "After almost 300 games and more than 50 goals with the light blue, we say goodbye to Erwin Saavedra. Together we live immense joys and great moments.We wish you the best of success in this new stage, Erwin. Thank you for everything! Bolivar will always be your home," the club said in a statement. The Bolivian midfield general spent a good nine years with Bolívar, though he was loaned out to Goias in 2017. With Sundowns having already reached their full foreign quota before Saavedra - Brian Onyango (Kenya), Peter Shalulile (Namibia), Gaston Sirino (Uruguay) and Pavol Safranko (Slovakia), one had to make way, and it was Brazilian Nascimento. Efforts to get comment from Sundowns proved fruitless as Yogesh Singh, who deals with player contracts, was not immediately available.
