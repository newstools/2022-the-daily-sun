SHE used to be called “big momma” in high school and this prompted her to start Curvish Queens to encourage plus-size girls to love and accept their body shape and size. As a plus-size model, Kamogelo Baloyi (21) realised a lot of girls shaped like her lacked confidence, so she approached plus-size queen Prudence Sekhudu and they started the initiative. On Saturday, 12 February, the Curvish Queens hosted a pool party at Mabopane Island Resort to encourage plus-size girls from Mabopane and Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, to carry themselves with pride and to love what they see in the mirror. Kamogelo from Mabopane said: “When we started this initiative in July, we wanted to do more in terms of women empowerment. We want to teach girls from an early age that if being thick is in their genes, they should embrace it. I come from a family where almost everyone is thick, and I tried to lose weight in the past, but it never worked. This brand doesn’t promote unhealthy living. We’re just saying if it’s in your genes, then accept it. We’re saying to society, accept us and stop judging us.” Prudence (25) from Soshanguve said most plus-size people have a low self-esteem. “We hosted this event to promote body positivity. We want people to accept their bodies the way they are, especially after trying to lose weight,” she said. Prudence said they wanted Curvish Queens to grow and spread to other kasis. Bridgette Maluleka (25) also from Soshanguve said she hasn’t always been big, but struggled to get back to her old shape after she gave birth in 2014. She’s now accepted herself as she is. Dimpho Leso (21) said she went to the pool party to celebrate her body and urged those who felt ashamed of their bodies to be positive.
