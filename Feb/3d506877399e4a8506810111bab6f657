THE Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa has condemned Operation Dudula, saying it will push people who are already vulnerable further into poverty. The non-profit human rights organisation said the operation was an attack on informal traders and migrants’ rights to make a living in Mzansi. In a statement issued on Tuesday, 15 February, the institute said the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the past two years has seen people from all walks of life being pushed into poverty. “In recent weeks the informal sector, which was the hardest hit by the prolonged lockdown compounded by policy neglect, is now being subjected to unlawful, discriminatory, and politically motivated conduct orchestrated by some political parties under the pretext of protecting employment for vulnerable South Africans,” said the organisation’s director of litigation, Jason Brickhill. He said the operation was an unlawful conduct which undermines constitutional values and democracy. Operation Dudula claimed most criminal activity in Mzansi were committed by undocumented foreigners. Brickhill said the Constitutional Court had long established and confirmed everyone’s right to work which cannot be separated from the right to dignity. “The unlawful victimisation of poor people is counterproductive. We urge all South African citizens to desist from the unlawful victimisation of the vulnerable members of our society,” said Brickhill.
