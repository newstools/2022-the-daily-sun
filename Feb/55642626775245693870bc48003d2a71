THE Bapedi kingdom visited Chief Kgoputso Phala ka Ga Matata in Mamelodi, Tshwane, on Saturday, 19 February, to be recognised by the leadership of King Thulare III. Phala said people should now know that Pedi people were represented in Tshwane. “I was unknown to the public, now I’m known. Let people understand and be proud of our culture.” Phala also condemned violence. “Let’s teach people our tradition and culture, and not undermine it. That will be undermining our ancestors,” said Phala. Kingdom spokesman Ntoampe Mampuru said they honoured the invitation so people could be exposed to other cultural practices and traditions. “By promoting cultures, we are promoting humanity as nowadays, people live like animals. We are here to offer support,” he said, adding that joblessness and crime were a concern. “But what is important for now is for people to regroup, get back to their senses and support one another,” he said. King Kegomoditswe Tlhapane of Bapitseng Ba Gotswe Le Thotwe said: “We are introducing ourselves and want to be recognised by government. We are also learning from other chieftaincies and kingdoms.” Gauteng Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa’s Funny Mbele said: “We are fighting with government to implement what is written in the Constitution, that says the chief must work with government.” Ambassador of Traditional Healers’ Organisation Francina Tema said: “Traditional leaders and healers must work together. We need to teach young people about our cultures.” Jack Simelane of Mamelodi Concerned Residents said: “Our concern is the morale degeneration, unity and rebuilding of our nation.”
