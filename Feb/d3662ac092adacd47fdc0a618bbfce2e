COMMUNITY builder Shaun Unterslak said he wants to use his bakery to empower unemployed people. The bakery would be a factory supplying the unemployed with products they can sell directly to residents. Mlungu Shaun’s bakery is situated in Refilwe squatter camp, a mining community outside Cullinan, Tshwane. He told Daily Sun that bread could become unaffordable for the masses reliant on government grants. “Our vision is to replicate the project in other rural communities once this project is operating at full potential,” Shaun said. “We would also like factories with canteen facilities, whose employees have had to take retirement due to becoming injured, to consider buying our products so that retired former workers can act as resellers and earn additional income.”  One reseller Patricia Maphakane (49) said she was glad that through the bakery project, her kids did not go to bed on empty stomachs. “Most of us are not working, so this project of selling bread gives us extra money. One loaf of bread costs R12 and I take R2 from each one I sell.”  Another reseller Jamaica Modila (59) from Phumzile Park said she started reselling bread Shaun started giving to jobless people last October. “The project has changed my life as I am able to make ends meet for my family,” he said. Gladys Jafta (27) said she started selling bread after meeting Shaun while he was delivering to her kasi. “I get to sell 30 loaves per day and with the profit I make, I can sustain myself and my family. I depend on social grants and it’s never enough for me and my three kids. This extra money helps a lot.”
