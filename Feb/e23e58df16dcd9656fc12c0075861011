HIGHER Education, Science and Innovation Minister Blade Nzimande has urged students to vaccinate in order for classes to resume with full contact learning, as well as campus activities. Nzimande briefed the media on Tuesday, 1 February on their readiness for the 2022 academic year. He said information gathered through the system used by the Department of Health reported that Mzansi has exited the fourth wave. “This development means 2022 is promising to be an academic year less disrupted by lockdown periods and restricted access to classes, if no new waves or variants surge again,” said the minister. “In line with the approach of the National Coronavirus Command Council and cabinet, I’d like to encourage everyone in our higher education and training community to get vaccinated.” Nzimande said Higher Health, which guides institutions on the management of the pandemic, is consulting scientific experts to draw up guidelines that institutions could follow in determining various matters around vaccination. He said they were awaiting the finalisation of these guidelines. Speaking on fees and other financial matters, Nzimande said: “I would like to point out that fee increases are agreed upon in the sector as part of a social compact that has been in place since 2016, the only year when fees were not increased.” He said for the 2022 academic year, a consumer price index increase to a maximum of 4,23% for tuition fees and CPI+2 to a maximum of 6,23% on accommodation fees was proposed. He said student debt has grown and the unaudited data showed that an estimated R6,1 billion was owed by students at the start of the 2021 academic year. “Audited accumulated gross student debt as at 31 December 2020 is R16,5 million. The amount is inclusive of students who have exited universities with debt,” he said. He said the survey also showed National Student Financial Aid Scheme students owed R5,3 billion.
