STHWANDWASENKOSI Sibanda had a difficult school year in 2021, due to Covid-19. However, the 19-year-old studied day and night to make up for lost time and ended up getting eight distinctions in her matric exams. Now the star performer of Bass Freedom College in Joburg is facing another hurdle. She was accepted to study a bachelor of Bachelor of Health Science at Wits University but she cannot afford to pay her fees.  Although she won a scholarship worth R42 000 from the university, it does not cover all her expenses and she needs a further R42 000. The overall cost for the first year of study is R84 000, not including accommodation. A heartbroken Sthandwa told Daily Sun she was desperate to study and needed help.  Her mum Nosipho Mpofu (38), who works as a domestic worker, said Sthandwa applied for other bursaries but she was turned down because the family was originally from Zimbabwe and she was not a South African citizen. Sthandwa said she was raised by a single mum who struggled financially. Nosipho said: “I don’t earn much and I have family back home I’m taking care of. We are appealing for help.” Nosipho said seeing her daughter crying broke her heart because she didn’t know how to help her.
