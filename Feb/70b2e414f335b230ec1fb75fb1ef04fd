THE Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit apprehended a 32-year-old stepfather for rape on Monday morning, 31 January in Joburg. Johannesburg Central police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele told Daily Sun the man allegedly raped his 11-year-old stepdaughter before Christmas at a flat on the corners of Delvers and Albert streets. “The victim was sleeping with her siblings when he raped her. He threatened to kill her if she screamed,” said Mbele. The girl shared the details with her mother and the suspect was on the run until the long arm of the law apprehended him. Mbele said just last week, another stepfather raped his 13-year-old stepdaughter. “The investigation is underway and the suspect will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court soon,” he said. The Joburg Central station commander, Brigadier Ivan Perumal, urged women to expose men who are abusing them and their children.
