TAXI drivers fear an ongoing protest about electricity is putting their businesses and even their passenger’s lives at risk. Drivers in Soweto said they were usually included in protests but they have been left out of the one currently underway in Protea South. Soweto Taxi Services, an industry representative, said drivers had been forced to change routes since the protest started on Monday, 7 February.  Spokesman Joe Ximba said it was dangerous because those routes were run by other associations. “We understand they’re frustrated because of electricity but we need to work together to address this issue,” he said. Joe told Daily Sun that during a protest in 2019, drivers even took residents to Eskom’s headquarters at Megawatt Park in Sandton, Joburg, in 20 taxis.  “Now they’re just doing as they please. We understand they have rights but they can’t hurt others,” he said. The SunTeam spoke to residents, who said they were not going to wait for them to get involved as that would have taken time. Solomon Ngwenya (41) said he just wanted the electricity problems in the area resolved. He said he understood taxi drivers had concerns but they should not interfere with what residents were trying to do.  Bongani Gumede (38) said he didn’t understand why taxi drivers had an issue with the protest at first but after hearing their concerns, he encouraged the residents to work with drivers to keep passengers safe. “At the end of the day, we’re all faced with this electricity problem, so let’s work together.”
