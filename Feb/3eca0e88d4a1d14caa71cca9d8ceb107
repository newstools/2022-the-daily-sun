PITSO Mosimane’s Al Ahly have set new records following their historic 4-0 victory over Saudi Arabia side Al HIlal to win a bronze medal in the Club World Cup third-place playoff at Al Nahyan Stadium on Saturday. This was Ahly’s second consecutive bronze medal under Mosimane’s guidance, and their biggest win in the history of the Club World Cup. The Red Eagles secured six victories to become the African team with the most wins in the competition's history.  Ahly are third behind Real Madrid, who won ten matches, and FC Barcelona, who won seven games. They also made history as they became the team with most games (18 matches), surpassing Auckland City FC’s record of 16 games. Yasser Ibrahim became the second defender to score for Al Ahly in the FIFA Club World Cup after Mohamed Hany, who scored against C.F. Monterrey of Mexico. Nine Red Eagles players managed to put their names on the scoring sheets of World Cup. Mohamed Aboutrika comes in first place scoring four goals, while Flávio Amado scored two goals together with Yasser Ibrahim and Emad Meteb , while El Sayed Hamdy, Hussien El Shahat, Mohamed Hany, Ahmed Abdelkader, and Amr El Soulia scored one goal. Ahly captain Mohamed El Shenawy said: “I would like to congratulate the players. They were up to the challenge. We wanted to reach the final. We were focused and concentrated on the game. This medal is our gift to the fans who have been supporting us in the past period.” However, Mosimane was not happy to have received a bronze medal despite making history. “I am not happy despite winning the bronze medal. I wanted one of a different colour this time, but after all, we made a huge achievement to Al Ahly and Egypt.”
