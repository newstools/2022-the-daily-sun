NO FUEL levy increase and personal income tax raise, and more money for grant beneficiaries will offer some relief to poor and working class South Africans. This was good news from Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, tabling his budget for the 2022/2023 financial year in parliament on Wednesday, 23 February. Admitting that households and businesses were under pressure in the wake of Covid-19, Godongwana said: “Now is not the time to increase taxes and put recovery at risk.” The minister also announced that the employment tax incentive would be expanded by 50% and a maximum monthly value of R1 500. The budget contained good news for grant beneficiaries as old age, war veterans, disability and care dependency grants would go up by R90 with a further R10 to be added in October. Foster care and child support grants will increase by R20 in April. Godongwana also announced the allocation of R44 billion for the R350 social relief of distress grant that had been extended for 12 months. But there was bad news for boozers and smokers as he announced sin tax increases. A can of beer or cider will cost 11c more, bottle of wine 17c, bottle of sparkling wine 76c, bottle of spirits R4,83, a packet of cigarettes R1,03 more, 25g of piped tobacco an extra 37c and 23g cigar increase by R6,77. Godongwana said tax collection had increased and was estimated revenue would be R1,55 trillion. “This positive surprise has come mainly from the mining sector due to higher commodity prices. “Improved revenue performance is not a reflection of an improvement in the capacity of our economy.” He announced that state coffers had a R182 billion windfall, which is why he decided to give back to the people.
