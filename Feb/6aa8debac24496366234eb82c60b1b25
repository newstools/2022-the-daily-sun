  Mbeki is in the Free State to meet with the provincial leadership to find a middle ground as the province struggles with deep divisions. The province has an interim leadership following a court order, which disbanded the elected structures. It is divided along factional lines, with Mxolisi Dukwana acting as a coordinator for the interim provincial committee. A provincial conference is expected this year, ahead of the ANC's policy conference. The divisions have grown deeper as the political future of former leader Ace Magashule hangs in the balance. Mbeki was handpicked as the ideal man to attempt to unify the province. The interim provincial committee said it would be engaging Mbeki and other leaders of the ANC. Mbeki's visit began on Thursday, and it is expected to conclude on Saturday. Mbeki told a gathering the ANC may need to audit its membership to entrench the renewal project.
