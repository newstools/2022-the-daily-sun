LATE maskandi star Mtshengiseni “Indidane” Gcwensa’s son, Siphesihle “Ithole LeNdidane” Gcwensa is following in his footsteps. The 24-year-old musician from Msinga in KZN recently released his EP, titled Ishoba Lezangoma. His father, who was dubbed maskandi king because of his unique sound, died in 2015 after a long illness. Siphesihle worked with his father’s old studio team, Mbhodobhodo Mdlalose on the lead guitar, Madoda Ntshingila on bass guitar, and Mzamo Ndlovu on sound engineer on the EP. He said this was to make sure that he brings back his father’s original sound. The maskandi newbie started his music career when he was featured by his late dad’s band, Amageza Amahle, in 2017 on their album, Game Over. ALSO READ : LUSANDA MBANE PAYS TRIBUTE TO MUM!
