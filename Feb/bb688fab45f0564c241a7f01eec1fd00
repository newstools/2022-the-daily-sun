THEY had just been paid and wanted to go buy themselves some clothes. However, when they took a taxi, they ended up getting a ride from hell. The friends from Mpumalanga wanted to go shopping in Joburg. Their nightmare started when they stopped a Quantum taxi from Etwatwa on Sunday morning, 6 February, after getting off a lift on Etwatwa N12 offramp going to Springs, Ekurhuleni. There were three people, two women and a man, inside. The woman pointed a gun at them and demanded all their belongings. When Titus Mbewe refused, the two men stabbed him several times. After they were robbed, the thugs dumped them in an isolated spot in Welgedacht, Springs. Titus ended up dying while waiting for an ambulance. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said the victims worked on a farm in Delmas. The surviving victim said Titus was from Malawi and he is from Mozambique. “We had been working together and developed a close bond. I never thought I would lose him this way,” he said. He said they were robbed of two cellphones, a laptop and cash. Ramphora said the suspects were unknown. Cases of murder and armed robbery are being investigated.
