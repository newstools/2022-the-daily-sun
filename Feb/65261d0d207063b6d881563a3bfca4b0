FIVE wanted gangsters who have been terrorising businesses and residents in Hluvukani in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, were attacked by an angry mob on Friday, 4 February, while drinking at a hotel. Luckily, the police rescued the thugs and arrested them. They were linked to a robbery and the murder of a 67-year-old man at his business premises in Acornhoek on Thursday, 3 February. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said: “About eight armed suspects entered the victim’s business and demanded cash. They reportedly shot and robbed him of an undisclosed amount of cash. They then hijacked a white VW Polo Classic parked outside and fled the scene. “On the same day, cops received information about suspicious people in possession of a firearm at Hluvukani Hotel. “They went to the scene and found suspects allegedly assaulted by some community members. They managed to whisk them off and apprehend them.” Mohlala said the suspects were found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. One was taken to hospital for medical treatment, where he’s under police guard. Another one (33) appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Monday, 7 February and the case was postponed to 17 February. Others, aged between 32 and 45, appeared in the Acornhoek Magistrates Court on Monday, and the case was postponed to 11 February. Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela welcomed the arrests, saying: “We hope through the investigation in relation to the suspects, more could be unfolded as a lot of robberies occurred in the area.”
