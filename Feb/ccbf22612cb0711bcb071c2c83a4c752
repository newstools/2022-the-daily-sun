GAUTENG police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said there was never a faceless John Wick and he does not exist! Mawela said they have also stabilised the threat caused by the Boko Haram gang in Mamelodi, Tshwane. On Saturday, 5 February, Mawela led Operation O Kae Molao in Mamelodi together with law enforcement officials. “John Wick doesn’t exist. “There no such thing called John Wick. We are dealing with criminals,” he said. “Car hijackings are still an issue and we already positively identified two stolen vehicles at roadblocks,” he said. Mawela told thugs in Mamelodi their days are numbered. He said they’d also ensure they work closely with contractors to identify those threatening them from doing their work. Furthermore, Mawela said they came to Mamelodi as it is one of the national hotspots for gender-based violence and that it has problems of assaults, hijackings and other violent crimes. He said during the operation, four drunk driving suspects and 16 undocumented immigrants were bust, while five shebeens were closed for operating unlawfully.
