AL Ahly coah Pitso Mosimane has again questioned why there’s still no Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in the Caf Champions League group stages. This comes after Mosimane and his charges were held to a goalless draw by Sudanese side Al-Hilal in Omdurman on Friday afternoon. Talking after the match Mosimane seem to be not impressed that there’s still no VAR at this stage of the tournament. “How do we still not have VAR yet? It should be used in the Champions League group stage,” Mosimane said as per Egyptian online publication KingFut. “Our group is difficult, it has strong teams. Al-Hilal are good on both attacking and defensive sides, they have a chance to qualify to the next stage.” Mosimane said three points would have been better in their opening match than a single point. He stated: “Winning was going to be a better start, but an away draw against Al-Hilal is okay. They are performing better compared to last year and they have a very good coach.” “Now we will focus on the upcoming Egyptian Premier League game, but we will do our best to qualify for the next stage as soon as possible.” This is not the first time Mosimane calls for the VAR in the tournament. Last season Mosimane also mentioned the same saying that African football chiefs must prioritise introducing VAR after the Caf Champions League title-holders drew 1-1 at Gendarmerie Nationale of Niger in a last-32 first leg. Al Ahly’s next clash in the Champions League will be against Mosimane’s former employers, Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday (26 February) in Cairo, Egypt. Mosimane will be facing Sundowns for the third time since arriving in Egypt. The previous two games took place last year in the Champions League quarter-finals, with Al Ahly coming on top 3-1 on aggregate (2-0 win and 1-1 draw).
