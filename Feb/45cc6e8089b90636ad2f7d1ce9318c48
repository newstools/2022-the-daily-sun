EASTERN Cape police have freed a man caught with 93-year-old Neville Vimpany’s bicycle, stolen while he was withdrawing money in Gqeberha. The Raleigh Western Flyer was given to him by his parents on his 21st birthday. After a week of searching and issuing a reward of R5 000 by sons Richard and Chris, a man was caught by the Greenshields neighbourhood watch on Monday, pushing it down the road. They handed him over, but the bicycle was booked and the man freed. On Tuesday, cops told News24 they freed him as a probe was ongoing. Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said: “SAPS Walmer confirmed the bicycle was recovered, but no one was arrested. Investigation into the theft is ongoing.” Chris said the suspect allegedly told cops he was on his way to hand it over and claim the reward.
