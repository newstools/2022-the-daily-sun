ERNST Middendorp's job as Maritzburg United coach is still safe, for now! This comes after the Team of Choice defeated SuperSport United 2-1 in a DStv Premiership match last night at Harry Gwala Stadium. Prior to this match, Maritzburg had played 11 matches without a win. They had last won a match four months ago when they defeated TS Galaxy 1-0 at Harry Gwala Stadium on 23 October. The poor run saw the KwaZulu-Natal club flirting with relegation which saw the club chairperson Farook Kadodia giving Middendorp a lifeline of three matches. The well-travelled mentor was told to win the first three home league games when the league resumed, the match against SuperSport (which they won 2-1), KZN derby against Golden Arrows (25 February) and Mamelodi Sundowns (5 March) to save his job. Nevertheless, striker Sunday Samu who joined Maritzburg in the January transfer window, repaid Middendorp helping the team take the first step towards saving the coach's job Samu, who was making his DStv Premiership debut, scored the opening goal for Maritzburg at the stroke of halftime and assisted Rowan Human when he scored the match's winning goal in the 71st minute to help them earn all three points. Maritzburg controlled the first half and were rewarded in the 45th minute when Samu broke the deadlock. However, they relinquished their lead on the 55th minute when Jesse Donn snatched an equaliser from Kudakashe Mahachi free-kick. In the 71st minute, Maritzburg re-claimed the lead through Human, and they were able to protect it until the final whistle. Maritzburg moved from position 13 to 12 spot on the log with 18 points from 19 matches.
