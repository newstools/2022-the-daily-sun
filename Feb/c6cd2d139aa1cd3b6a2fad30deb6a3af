SA Football Association president, Danny Jordaan, has indicated that the job is not done for Banyana Banyana who have qualified for the Africa Women Cup of Nations (Awcon) finals in Morocco on 2-23 July. Jordaan has made it clear what this qualification means, saying Banyana will have to qualify for the Fifa Women’s World Cup finals, penned for Australia and New Zealand next year. Banyana booked their spot in the Awcon finals after progressing 3-1 on aggregate against Algeria when they drew 1-1 at Stade Omar Hamadi on Wednesday in Algiers. Banyana won the home leg 2-0. Banyana will now be aiming to win the Awcon for the first time, which will be good enough for a World Cup spot. “Congratulations to the head of delegation, coach Desiree Ellis and the team,” said Jordaan, who confessed Safa was interested in hosting the Women’s World Cup in 2027. “We are going to the Awcon in Morocco to qualify for the World Cup and win it. “The team showed courage and football intelligence. I have no doubt this team will compete at the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Morocco.” In order to qualify for the 2023 World Cup finals, Banyana will have to reach the semi-finals of the Awcon to be one of the four automatic qualifiers. Two more teams will go into a continental play-off. Banyana qualified for the World Cup in France for the first time in 2019 when they finished runners-up to Nigeria at the 2018 Awcon in Ghana. Other nations that have qualified for Awcon finals are Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Togo, Cameroon, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia. The Afcon finals draw will be held in the coming weeks. Ellis admitted their finishing was poor. “We could have been three or four up before they scored the goal (in the second leg),” she said. Without a doubt, the two matches gave Ellis a clear indication on areas they need to improve on before the finals.
