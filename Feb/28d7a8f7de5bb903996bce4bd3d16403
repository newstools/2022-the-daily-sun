TS GALAXY players are motivated! And their 1-0 win against giants Kaizer Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup has lifted the lid on their demoralised pots, and looks like they’re now ready to keep the steam going on. Ethan Brooks, the club’s top Rockets, said he hopes the win will boost their morale in the fight against relegation from the DStv Premiership. Their big win against the Soweto giants made them believe that they will add to Swallows FC’s frustration woes in this bottom-of-the-table contest at the Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday (6pm). The Bafana Bafana international is optimistic they will avoid relegation: “It is not going to be easy, but we can do it.” The Mpumalanga-based side are bottom of the table with 13 points from 17 games, while Swallows are third from the bottom with 15 points from 19 games. Brooks told SunSport the Rockets are not entertaining any thoughts of going down to the lower league, and that the players will fight tooth and nail to survive. The 20-year-old midfielder said there is an air of optimism in camp, and coach Sead Ramovic motivates them every day not to give up. “He had conversations with everyone to hammer the message home. “He told us to take all the remaining games seriously and try not to concede silly goals, and keep it tight at the back,” added Brooks. “We believe in ourselves, and we will put up the fight until the end. We are in a good space mentally because of the win (against Chiefs). Our target is to collect as many points as we can in the first few games.” The Rockets will rely on the experience of well-travelled veteran defender Vuyo Mere to guide them in the battle against relegation.
