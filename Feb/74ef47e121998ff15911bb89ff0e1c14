KGOTHATSO started doing drugs in 2012. Now he has finally quit and he wants to warn Mzansi about the dangers of drugs. He said his family’s tears motivated him to stop and he’ll never look back. Kgothatso Makgae (24) from Naledi, Soweto told Daily Sun he started using drugs when he was at school. He said his parents never suspected anything and they were even proud of his good grades. But then he got to grade 9 and his life changed. He asked a friend who always passed his grades with flying colours how he did it. The friend told him he smoked crystal meth and it kept him up all night and that’s how he was able to study for long hours. “I wanted to pass as well as he did, so I experimented and it worked. Little did I know I was setting myself up for failure in future.” He said after high school, he attended college at South West Gauteng TVET College in Dobsonville. Later after his N6, he got an internship with a car company. He said he was still able to control his drug abuse but then his internship ended. “I thought I would get a permanent job but they didn’t renew my contract,” he said. At the time his girlfriend was also pregnant and he felt as if his world was crumbling. “I lost my mind, I literally went crazy. I would set things on fire – and that included my clothes and things in the house. “The madness got worse and my parents took me to rehab and the rehab transferred me to a psychiatric hospital,” he said. After his discharge early last year, he never looked back. His ex has also given him access to see their child. His mum Elma Makgae said Kgothatso’s drug use shocked her because her son was a bright kid and well-behaved. “When he stopped using drugs, I was so proud of him and his journey. We’re very happy,” she said. Neighbour Kenelwe Lusaba said she was disappointed when she heard Kgothatso was into drugs. “I’m so proud of the man he’s become today. I pray he gets his life back on track and gets a job.”
