DRESSED LIKE mourners, the thugs join the funeral procession. But under their coats they carry crowbars, jamming kits and the tools of their evil trade. WHILE THE MOURNERS BATTLE THE SADDEST MOMENT OF THEIR GRIEF, THE THUGS STRIKE! The robbers have no interest in the funeral or who the dead person may have been as they are after what mourners have left behind in their cars. Once the mourners move away from their cars the thugs go to work. Kagiso police in Mogale City said they had noticed the new trend by criminals during funeral services at cemeteries. “Unsuspecting mourners park their motor vehicles at the cemetery to attend and pay their last respects to their loved ones or friends, only to become the victims of crime,” said Captain Solomon Sibiya. Girly Diphatsoe (28), who had recently attended a funeral, said she left her bag under the seats thinking it was safe but when she came back, it was gone. “Inside was R800 cash and two cellphones, a Samsung and a Nokia, worth R4 200.” She was attending a friend’s funeral in Swaneville, Kagiso. Mourner Themba Dube said he had lost his laptop when thugs broke open the door of his Toyota Yaris with what looked like a crowbar. Sibiya said they had received complaints from mourners who had lost their personal belongings such handbags, laptops, cellphones and other valuable items. “Thugs break into cars to steal whatever they can lay their hands on,” he said. “We want to warn people who attend a funeral service to avoid leaving their valuable assets where criminals can see them.” Sibiya advised those who have got valuables to rather carry them with them and not to leave it in the car. “Do not leave anything on the car seats that might attract criminals,” he said. “Criminals have no mercy and don’t even respect the dead. “They are opportunists who monitor your level of alertness and will prey on unsuspecting individuals in a split second,” he said.
