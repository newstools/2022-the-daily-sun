CAMEROONIAN head coach, Antonio Conceicao, has put his head held up high despite the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) hosts ending the tournament in third place following their penalties win against Burkina Faso. Their 5-3 penalties win, following a 3-3 stalemate at the Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde, Conceicao reckons they demonstrated the strength of character “of this group and we won on penalties”. The Cameroon coach told cafonline that their dream of reaching the final of the competition was dashed by Egypt, with another penalties defeat, 3-1. “We had a first objective, which was to play the final, but it was decided on details in the semi-final against Egypt,” he told Africa’s football controlling body. “Forty-eight hours after playing extra time, I couldn’t take any risks with the players and that’s why I reshuffled my team. “We saw several players play tonight and I’m satisfied with their performance” Ambroise Oyongo used his experience to score the decisive penalty for the Indomitable Lions to win it. The two sides came into the match after losing their semi-final matches and they showed zeal to fight for the bronze medal. The Stallions’ workhorse, Bertrand Traore, won man of the match for his marauding energy in the field, which helped the Burkinabe hold on to their lead for the better part of the regulated time. But they lost it at the death, which led to the lottery of penalties stage where all went horribly wrong. “I’m very disappointed after this result. “We had the game in our hands. We were leading 3-0 before being caught a few seconds from the end of the game. It’s professional misconduct because we had everything to win the game. This result comes to ruin our course,” shouted Traore. ” His coach Kamou Malo said it was hard to explain what happened. “We were leading 3-0 and then the Cameroonians came back,” he added.
