IQRAAM Rayners’ late goal helped SuperSport United beat Maritzburg United 1-0 at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday night to secure their place in the Nedbank Cup last 16 round. Rayners got the better of Maritzburg defenders – Clayton Daniels and Alfred Ndengane – in the 89th minute to curl the ball past keeper Marcel Engelhardt into the roof of net. The Tshwane side have now gone past the first round of the competition for the first time since they lifted the trophy in 2017. Matsatsantsa a Pitori continued with their dominance over Maritzburg in all competitions, having registered eight victories in 11 meetings compared to one win for Ernst Middendorp’s side, with two draws. Maritzburg have now gone 14 games without a win. The teams met in September last year in a league match with SuperSport winning the game 2-1 at home. SuperSport started a post Teboho Mokoena era with youngster Jesse Donn marshalling the midfield alongside Jamie Webber. Mokoena joined city rivals Mamelodi Sundowns during the January transfer window. SuperSport also played without their influential strikers Bradley Grobler and Thamsanqa Gabuza due to injuries, while Sipho Mbule was also a notable absentee. Tembo had a bench full of youth promoted from their reserve side as he is on a rebuilding phase. His counterpart, Ernst Middendorp introduced four new signings in his starting line-up out of the six players he signed with Nicholas Lukhubeni, Lucky Baloyi, Zambian Friday Samu and Zimbabwean Macheke Tamanda getting the nod. They started life without Bafana Bafana striker Bongukuhle Hlongwane who joined MLS side Minnesota United in USA.
