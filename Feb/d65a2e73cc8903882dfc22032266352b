GOLDEN Arrows have acquired the services of midfielder Sera Motebang. The 26-year-old was among the seven players released by PSL rookies Royal AM on 12 January. Ironically, Motebang was reported to have joined Chippa United together with defender Ronald Pfumbidzai and striker Siphelele Luthuli. However, when Pfumbidzai and Luthuli were finally unveiled by the Eastern based side, Motebang was not in the Chilli Boys den. The Lesotho International has now resurfaced in Durban where he has reunited with coach Lehlohonolo Seema having worked together at the now defunct Bloemfontein Celtic. Motebang struggled for game time when the club relocated to Durban after being bought by TV personality Shauwn “MaMkhize” Mkhize as he made only three appearances in John Maduka’s coached side. He went down the pecking order and struggled to reproduce the form that made him the darling of Celtic fans which led to his release.
