ORLANDO Pirates coach Mandla Ncikazi has explained why the club did not bring any new faces in the January transfer period. Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs are two teams who were expected to add new faces to their squads in order to wrestle the league title from runaway leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. But the two Soweto giants did not open the cheque books, which is something that left their fans with a lot of question marks. Ncikazi explained why the Buccaneers did not sign or release any players. Talking to members of the media at the Nedbank Cup Launch on Tuesday evening, Ncikazi said: “As much as I would have loved to sign players in this window, we respect the people that handle that aspect of operations in the club, therefore we have to be in line with the vision and processes at the club.” “If we had the resources like other teams, maybe we would even try to bring Lionel Messi to Pirates. We never have a perfect team therefore we can always bring people on board. There are areas that you would wish (to strengthen) but the timing of bringing players into the team is also important in our team, with regards to when and how they bring the players.” Ncikazi said they are looking at continuity as they aim to finish in a Caf Champions League spot this season. In the past campaign, Pirates qualified for the Caf Confederation Cup. They are currently in the group stages of the tournament. Ncikazi added: “The club is looking towards a direction of continuity. We would rather welcome back a player that has been in the system for a while, a player that already understands what’s expected of them and has already acclimatized to the way we do things at Pirates,” he said.
