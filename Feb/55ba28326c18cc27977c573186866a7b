SERGEANT Mpe Teme, who bust Ntuthuko Shoba, took to the witness stand on Wednesday, 2 February. Teme, who is stationed at the Roodepoort Police Station in Joburg, said he called Shoba for an interview because he was the last person to be seen with his pregnant girlfriend Tshegofatso Pule before she was found dead in June 2020. He said at the time, Shoba was not a suspect. “On the day I interviewed Shoba, he gave me his statement and when I asked if he had a problem with me checking his phone, he said no. I checked and found nothing incriminating or linking him to Pule. I kept the phone.” Teme said Pule’s name wasn’t even saved on the phone, so he assumed Shoba had saved her number under a different name. “I realised the phone was no longer active. The accused did not ask for permission to do a sim swap,” said Teme. He said after Pule’s killer Muzikayise Malephane pleaded guilty and confessed he was instructed to murder her by Shoba, he was arrested. He said after the arrest, he found another phone in Shoba’s house. Teme said the second phone had Whats­App messages between Shoba and Pule. Teme will return to the stand on Thursday, 3 February, to be cross-examined by Shoba’s lawyer Norman Makhubela.
