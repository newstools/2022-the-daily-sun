THE Zondo Commission has been granted another extension by the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane. The court ruled on Wednesday, 23 February, that the commission had until April to complete its work. The ruling also granted President Cyril Ramaphosa four months to make a submission to parliament about how he would implement the commission’s findings after receiving the final version. On Friday, 18 February, commission secretary Itumeleng Mosala said it would not be possible to release the final part of the three-part report by the end of February, as was previously planned. Mosala said the failure was regrettable but there were a number of reasons for it, including that acting chief justice Raymond Zondo had to take time off to prepare for his Judicial Service Commission interview for the permanent chief justice position. Zondo has to submit the remainder of his report either at the end of April, or part thereof, at the end of March and the last bit at the end of April.
