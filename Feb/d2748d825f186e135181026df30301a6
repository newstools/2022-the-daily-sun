ROYAL AM climbed to third spot on the DStv Premiership table after rallying back from two goals down to rescue a point in a 2-2 draw against relegation-threatened Chippa United at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday. Mxolisi Macuphu  pulled a late show when he scored an equaliser for Royal AM in the last minute of the match to complete his brace of the match.  Abafana ka Mam’Mkhize were 2-0 down in the first 23 minutes of the match. Veleyeke Zulu opened the scoring for the home team in what was a surprise with Royal AM having dominated the game.  Four minutes later, new signing Siphelele Lithuli who joined Chippa from Royal AM in January doubled the lead. The two goals in the first half saw the Chilli Boyz rewriting history today as they managed to score two first-half goals for the first time in six years. Royal AM were abe to pull one back through Macuphu on the 30th minute of the match. The Chilli boyz thought they had done enough to earn all three points but defending at the edge of their goal saw them throw away a lead and a chance to move 12 on the log after 19 matches as Macuphu completed his brace in the 90th minute to make it 2-2. Royal AM missed a chance to move second on the log with Orlando Pirates in the DStv Premiership this weekend. They occupy the third position after 19 matches with a total of 30 points.
