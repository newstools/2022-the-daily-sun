THE gates at Sahlumbe High School have been locked since Monday, 14 February. Gatvol parents shut down the school in Ladysmith, KZN, and demanded the education department provides seven teachers for grade 8 pupils. They apparently took action after a meeting with school management came to naught. The problem started last July during a service delivery protest. Protesters blocked seven teachers from entering and they applied for transfers to other schools. Mfundo Dladla (28), who has three siblings at the school, said they were forcing the department to take them seriously. “My siblings were supposed to start grade 8 but were sent home. They came home with a letter stating grade 8 pupils must stay home until further notice as there were no teachers to teach them,” he said. A parent, Ntombenhle Mazibuko (47), said the department left them no option but close the school. SGB chairman, Siyabonga Ngubane, said they wrote to the department to ask officials to intervene as the school couldn’t continue with unpaid volunteer teachers. “They responded by asking us to recommend local teachers who can fill the vacant posts. We called a parents’ meeting and the school management was there,” he said. “We made a list of the teachers and attached their CVs with the hope that the matter would be resolved but nothing happened. “Give the school teachers and everything will return to normal.” KZN education spokesman, Sihle Mlotshwa, said: “It is only grade 8 pupils that are affected by the teacher shortage. Parents must allow schooling to continue while the teacher shortage is attended to.”
