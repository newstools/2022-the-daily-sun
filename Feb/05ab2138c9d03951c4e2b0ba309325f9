AJAX Amsterdam star, Sébastien Haller, became the first player to score in each of his first seven Uefa Champions League games. On Wednesday, he extended his tally to 11 goals in a 2-2 draw away at Benfica in the first leg of their last-16 clash where he also scored an own goal. Haller has scored more goals in seven Champions League matches for Ajax than he did in 48 Premier League matches for West Ham United where he scored only 10 goals. The Ivory Coast international surpassed Liverpool’s Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah’s record of 10 goals in the Champions League. He became the first African player to score 11 goals in the tournament. Haller told the Champions League website that scoring 10 goals in the group stage was not in his dreams although scoring is a great feeling for a striker in the best competition. “Of course, I didn’t expect (to score 10 times in the group stage), especially in my first games,” said Haller. “The only thing you want to do is perform well and be in the flow of the game.” He stated that he didn’t score a lot of goals for West Ham because the pieces of the puzzle just didn’t fit. “A football team is like a puzzle, the pieces have to fit together. At West Ham, it was not quite right for me. I was not the right part. No matter what I tried, it didn’t work. But at Ajax, the coach knows me well and I know what he wants,” he told the website.
