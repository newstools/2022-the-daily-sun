STELLENBOSCH FC will only have themselves to blame after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Swallows FC at Danie Craven Stadium last night. Steve Barker’s charges took the lead as 10th minute against the Dube Birds, but poor game management and lack of killer instinct saw them conceding with the last kick of the match to earn a point at home. Much improved Stellenbosch had appeared to be cruising to register their eighth win of the season as the final whistle approached. However, Wandisile Letlabika had another plan as he scored right at the death. The 32-year-old struck when it mattered the most, levelling the matters from a rebound after Stellies failed to clear a corner kick. Relegation-threatened Swallows players and the technical team celebrated as if they had won the match to show how important a point away from home was for them. Zitha Kwini, formerly known as Macheke, scored the match’s opening goal in the 10th minute to put Stellies in the driving seat. The hosts suffered a blow in the 32nd when Solomon Letsoenyo had to go off with what looked like a severe knee injury and was replaced by Marc van Heerden. Stellies could have scored a couple of goals, but they were not clinical enough, like their opponents Swallows, who could not bury their chances. It looked like Swallows will lose their ninth match of the season until the late drama where Letlabika saved them. However, the Dube Birds remain in danger as they are in position 14 with 15 points. Despite the draw, there is still immense pressure on Swallows players to turn around things as they have only won twice this season. On the other end, Stellies leapfrogged Kaizer Chiefs to the third position with 30 points. Chiefs remain in fourth place with 29 points from 17 matches.
