FORMER public enterprises minister Malusi Gigaba has slammed the second part of the Zondo report, calling it umbhedo. He claimed the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, chaired by acting chief justice Raymond Zondo, was a waste of time and money. “Three years and R1 billion later, deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo has found no evidence to warrant a recommendation that I be charged with corruption,” he alleged. “Instead of clearing me, he asks that I be investigated some more in the hope that this will kill me politically.” Zondo recommended that criminal charges be laid against Gigaba, Gupta associate Salim Essa, former Transnet chief financial officer Anoj Singh, former Transnet CEO Brian Molefe, former Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama, former Transnet chief financial officer Garry Pita and former Transnet chief procurement officer Thamsanqa Jiyane. “Gigaba in fact knew all the Gupta brothers and their mother, was especially a friend of Mr Ajay Gupta (who he would visit at Sahara Computers) and made regular visits to the Gupta Saxonwold compound while he was minister of public enterprises,” said Zondo. The report said three witnesses testified to the commission that Molefe, Singh, Gama and Gigaba were recipients of cash bribes from the Gupta enterprise. All three witnesses were drivers and close protection officers to these officials.
