KAIZER Chiefs defender Mulomowandau Mathoho says it would be suicidal to take struggling Baroka lightly when they battle it out in a DStv Premiership match at Polokwane’s Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (7.30pm). Mathoho is aware that Bakgaga will give them a tough time like they did in the first round when they bounced back from two goal down to hold them to a 2-2 draw at FNB Stadium in August last year. Baroka are desperate for points to move away from the basement of Premiership having collected 14 points from 19 matches while Chiefs are hoping to close the 19 points gap between them and leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. The Soweto giant are sitting in fifth position on 29 points from 17 matches. Said Mathoho: “We respect Baroka and this won’t be an easy game. We are expecting a tough match. We have prepared well, and we’ve had a good training session. I know that sometimes history doesn’t work, we need to focus and follow the coach’s instructions to ensure we take three points.” Mathoho says he is ready to deal with whatever Bakgaga attack led by Evidence Mokgopa will throw at them. “Personally, I am fit to play and ready for anything because I know this will be a big encounter and we are going there with that mentality not to undermine Baroka. They always make things tough for us. We need to work extra hard, and we are ready for whatever they will throw at us.” The lanky defender says they won’t give up on the title race until the last day of the season. “I won’t say the league title is gone because there are still matches still to play and anything can happen. I mean other teams will drop points and we need to push to win our remaining games. That’s when we will be able to gauge how our chances are in our last league game.”
