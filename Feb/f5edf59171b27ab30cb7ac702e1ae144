POET Ntsiki Nazwai has responded to the claims that she demanded R70 000 from Podcast and Chill with Mac G to be on the show. On social media she admitted she did ask for the money but it was to help with her legal fees and she did make that clear to MacG. Two weeks back, the podcaster claimed they had invited Ntsiki to the show to talk about gender-based violence and she demanded R70 000. Ntsiki said she was disappointed with MacG for making her plea public. “It was with great disappointment to learn of MacG trying to use a private conversation with me for personal gain. I thought I would ignore it, but owing to the false narrative being created that I get paid for activism, I must protect my integrity.” ALSO READ : BET PRESENTER'S BABY JOY! Ntsiki said MacG’s team initially offered to help her and then later insulted her. “The R70 000 discussed was to help pay for my legal bills and this was made very clear. They gave me the impression they wanted to help as they felt I was not treated with justice by the system. Their office was very vocal about the people who have sued me and they wanted to help,” she said. “When the deal wasn’t coming together, it was followed by a string of insults on WhatsApp which ultimately resulted in them choosing to frame the narrative to cause harm to my image,” claimed Ntsiki. She then apologised to all GBV victims and said she would never take money for their pain. “I apologise to all the victims and everyone affected by GBV for this false narrative created about me, I would never take money for your pain,” she said.
