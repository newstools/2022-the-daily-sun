It’s 2022 and
surely it is time that we ‘reimagined’ Valentine's Day. The annual day of love
is no longer just for traditional couples and ‘Mills & Boon’ style romance,

if you’ll be woo’ing your partner, spoiling your sister or bonding with your
bestie this Valentine's Day weekend, choose an active endeavour that will have
you both laughing, moving and having fun. Claire Bowen from
the brand for active people, Shower to Shower says that being active together
has so many benefits beyond just having fun! “The second your body is active,
the brain releases endorphins, which make you feel immediately lighter and happier.
