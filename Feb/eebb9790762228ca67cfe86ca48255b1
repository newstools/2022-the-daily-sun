NDEBELE Queen Sekhothali Mabhena has urged women to believe in themselves. She said women should believe they are capable of doing anything they’re interested in. Queen Sekhothali was speaking to 200 women at a business seminar at the AFM Phola Assembly in Phola, near Ogies in Mpumalanga, on Saturday 5 February. The seminar was organised by the SoGutjhe Royal House under the direction of newly-inaugurated Chief Sipho Mahlangu. “The women of this area have the power to develop the area and improve its economy,” she said. “As women, we should not be scared to start our own businesses. We are capable of doing anything we put out minds to and we need to believe in ourselves.” Queen Sekhothali said she hoped the seminar would inspire local women to implement what it had taught them. “You will choose among the type of businesses that were discussed at the meeting,” she said. At the seminar, women were encouraged to focus on agriculture, manufacturing, transport, construction and tourism. Kgomotso Mohlala from the Business Skills for South Africa Foundation said she was happy to empower the women. “Women in Mzansi have the right to take part in the economy. All they need is to focus,” she said. Dinah Mtsweni (41) and Getrude Msiza (35) said the seminar was an eye-opener and they felt motivated to start their own businesses.
