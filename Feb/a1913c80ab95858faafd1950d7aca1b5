RICHARDS Bay coach Sifiso Dladla says there was no better match to prepare his side for the second half of the GladAfrica Championship season than playing DStv Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns in the last-32 of the Nedbank Cup. Dladla said it is no disgrace to lose 4-0 to Downs, after the Tshwane giants ran rampant at Princess Magogo Stadium on Friday. He said that match will help to toughen up his players when the Championship resumes in two weeks. Dladla was thankful to Downs co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi for his words of advice after the match. He said they will come in handy when the season resumes: “He’s nurturing us as young coaches. “He’s giving us advice. After the game we had a chat and he’s a very well grounded coach.” Bay and JDR Stars are joint-top of the Championship table, with 32 points after 17 matches. The two pacesetters will face each other at Richards Bay Stadium on 19 February. “There was no game we were going to play that is better than facing Mamelodi Sundowns (to help us prepare for the resumption of the league),” said Dlala. “This one showed our weaknesses more than our strengths, which is something that we needed. We learnt a lot about defending in our box.” Dladla said he was pleasantly surprised when he went to the changing room after the game and found players were not subdued or upset due to the loss. In fact, Dladla added: “After the game, players were celebrating, you would have thought we have won the game. I was so impressed because they are different players now, so we learnt a lot.”
