SOUTH African veteran referee Victor Gomes will be in charge of the Africa Cup of Nations final (Afcon) match between Senegal and Egypt at the Yaounde-Stade Olembe on Sunday. Caf confirmed the news on Friday. Gomes will be assisted by Southern Africa based officials, country-man Zakhele Siwela and Lesotho’s Souru Phatsoane. Jean-Jacques Ngambo Ndala from DR Congo was named the fourth match official of the highly anticipated fixture. Senegal will be hoping to secure their first-ever Africa Cup of Nations title, while Egypt is looking to win their eighth and first since 2010. Liverpool star will lead the two countries with Mohamed Salah leading Egypt while his Liverpool teammate Sadio Mane will be carrying Senegal on his shoulders, hoping to make history. Mane suffered heartbreak at the last Afcon final two-and-a-half years ago, losing to Algeria in the final of the tournament, which was held in Egypt. Salah has also tasted defeat in the final, as a late Vincent Aboubakar goal gave Cameroon a 2-1 victory against Egypt in Gabon five years ago. Congratulates to our #COSAFA match officials!
