MAMELODI Sundowns striker Pavol Safranko is doubtful to make the trip to Egypt for their Caf Champions League clash against Sudan side Al-Merrikh on Saturday (3pm). The Slovakian International striker was stretchered off the pitch with a hamstring injury in Downs 1-1 draw against Baroka FC on Monday. Safranko was replaced by newly signed Bolivian striker Erwin Saavedra. Downs co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi revealed that Safranko’s injury doesn’t look good. He went on: “It’s a bit of a touch and go for Pavol. He is still going to be assessed, but it doesn’t look good.” Meanwhile, Mngqithi revealed that he will take over more than 25 players for their trip to Egypt as they will remain there for their date against Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly next Friday. Explained Mngqithi: “Normally we take 25 players for one match, this time we will take a little bit more because we know there are Covid-19 issues, and some players are not yet ready to play the first match, maybe they will play the second one.”
