SEX dolls have become very popular with many people in Mzansi saying they would not mind having one because it does not come with girlfriend allowance. While some might be using it because they do not have sexual partners, some are having their late partners cloned into sex dolls and all they need is a photo. A sex robot company, Lux Botics, is offering clones of dead partners using groundbreaking 3D modelling, the Daily Star reported. An artist uses sophisticated modelling to create a mold and place a skeleton inside it. They are also hoping to create sex robots that “truly walk on their own” in the near future. The sex robot comes with speech control, a facial recognition function, and artificial intelligence capabilities. Initially, a 3D model would be created using sophisticated modelling before being printed out in a fine resolution. “We can make robots that talk but we have not made robots that truly walk on their own. We hope to develop this in the near future. We can make a large number of body parts that can move in a realistic manner,” Lux Botics co-founder Bjorn Johnsson told the Daily Star.
