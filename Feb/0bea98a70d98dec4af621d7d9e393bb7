FORMER Rhythm City actress Nolo Phiri has embarked on a new journey to impart her knowledge onto the next generation of actors. She will be doing TV and acting masterclasses, that will take place virtually on the YouDeh app – co-owned by award-winning musician DJ Tira. YouDeh, an app that allows users to connect with people around the world through paid-for private meeting requests, was started in 2021. With her knowledge and experience in TV performance and production, Nolo will offer masterclasses in television. She will break down the different elements of what goes into performing for TV, and take people into the world of production.

My hope is that these masterclasses open the same doors I enjoyed to new and better opportunities for aspiring creatives.” Founder of YouDeh Thulani Ngwenya said he was excited to have Nolo running classes on the app. “This will give aspiring TV personalities an opportunity to learn from one of the best in the industry,” he said.
