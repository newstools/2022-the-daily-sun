PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa is due to deliver the State Of the Nation Address (Sona) later today, Thursday, 10 February. Many people have expectations of what he must address, including the Southern African Alcohol Policy Alliance in SA. The association has called on Ramaphosa to ensure he makes clear government’s plans to address alcohol harm and reaffirm his commitment to making Mzansi a booze-safe country. It says the ANC’s January 8 statement last year was very direct in addressing harmful use of alcohol, saying: “Throughout the country, communities are still confronted by high rates of crime and violence. The lack of safety threatens and undermines their sense of well-being and hampers social and economic development. Other social problems, such as drug and alcohol abuse, contribute to violence and cause many families great misery.” ALSO READ: BAE AND 9 MEN GANG-RAPE WOMAN! Director Maurice Smithers said Ramaphosa was also on record as saying that increasing the age limit, reducing trading hours, raising the tax on alcohol and limiting advertising should all be considered possible interventions to reduce the negative impact of harmful drinking.  He said despite these statements, very little happened to address alcohol-related harm over the last year. Progress should have been made on processing the Liquor Amendment Bill approved by Cabinet for public comment in 2016.  Smithers said temporary restrictions put in place to manage Covid-19 infections have shown strengthened legislation to be effective in reducing harmful drinking.  “What is needed is permanent legislative change and not reactive temporary measures that don’t deal with social challenges effectively and consistently. “As an organisation, we find the absence of any reference to addressing alcohol harm in the January 8 Statement very disappointing after the robust call in last year’s statement and the president’s follow-up newspaper interview in mid-January last year,” he said.
