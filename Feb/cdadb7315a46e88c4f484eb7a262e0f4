Moral of the story, never compare your situation to others for your circumstances are very different. At that time, I was raising my kids, breastfeeding and the other and working.” “It wasn’t easy, felt like dropping out a lot of times but those little faces needed someone to look up to, needed an inspiration and I had to make sure that I’m that inspiration. I had to make sure I help them see the possibility of achieving in a world that says they can’t,” she concluded. Lerato is not the only media personality who recently went back to school.
