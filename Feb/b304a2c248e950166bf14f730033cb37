WEST Ham United manager, David Moyes has backed his decision to start Kurt Zouma against Watford despite circulating videos on social media showing him kicking and slapping his pet cat. On Monday, a video of the Hammers defender circulated on social media where he was seen kicking, slapping, and throwing shoes at his pet cat as it tried to escape. The video is believed to have been recorded by his brother, who then later posted the video on Snapchat, Sky Sports reports. Social media users, ex-football players, and analysts shared their opinions about the incident and hinted that Zouma shouldn’t play for West Ham again. Despite their opinion, Moyes named Zouma in his starting line-up when West Ham beat Watford 1-0 at London Stadium on Monday night. Moyes told BBC Sport after the match that they’re all disappointed with what Zouma did and believed that he will learn from it. However, he said he picked Zouma to give himself the best chance of winning the game. "I know how people feel, but I'm also a football manager here,” he was quoted by the website. My feeling was that Kurt has apologised and I understand a lot of people will not just be accepting of an apology. But to me, he came out and (apologised) honestly and I had to do my job," Zouma was booed by both sets of supporters during Tuesday's match despite his apology earlier on Tuesday. A video obtained by The Sun allegedly shows footballer Kurt Zouma kicking and hitting his cat. It’s absolutely disgusting and disturbing footage. I hope he is prosecuted for animal cruelty. pic.twitter.com/3K7xMeHh5j
