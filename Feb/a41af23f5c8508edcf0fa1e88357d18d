Two rhino poachers from Mozambique have been handed over a hefty sentence by the Skukuza Regional Court in Mpumalanga. The two poachers that were arrested in May 2019 were each sentenced to 23 years behind bars and the South African National Parks (SANParks) have welcomed the jail terms. The two men were found guilty of trespassing in a national park, killing protected rhinos, possessing an illegal firearm and ammunition, and contravention of the Immigration Act. Gareth Coleman, managing executive of the KNP told News24 that: "We welcome the resumption of trials in Skukuza and congratulate the prosecution for presenting a compelling case to the court which led to the two convictions and sentencing." Coleman added that there was still more to be done, especially outside the park, to arrest those responsible for destroying natural heritage
