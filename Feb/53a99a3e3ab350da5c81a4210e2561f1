KAIZER Chiefs, who are going through another bad patch this season, have had some good news with the possible return to training of star left-back Sifiso Hlanti. The defender, who joined Amakhosi at the start of the season, will, according to a SunSport source, start jogging sometime next month after he completes his rehabilitation from his long-term injury. Hlanti, who joined Chiefs from Swallows FC, suffered what Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter said was a devastating Achilles rupture during training last November, just days before the Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates. Such an injury can take seven to nine months to heal, depending on the severity of the injury. Hlanti is said to be making good progress. According to the source, the Bafana Bafana defender can feature for Amakhosi before the season ends. “Hlanti will start jogging with the club next month and they expect him to be fully fit in May,” said an insider. The insider even said Bafana coach Hugo Broos has allegedly spoken to Hlanti and may, depending on his health and Chiefs medical team, consider him for the Bafana squad that will face France in a glamour friendly game in Lille on 29 March. But he fears Chiefs management will not accept Hlanti’s call up to the Bafana squad so soon because he could aggravate the injury. When the injury occurred, the 31-year-old Hlanti had just started eight matches in all competitions, with a solitary goal. He was looking in good form before the injury.
