TV AND radio host Sibusiso “DJ Sbu” Leope recently sent Mzansi into a frenzy after he encouraged his followers to hug trees. Though his fanbase loved him for encouraging and advising the youth to make something out of themselves, his recent advice left many thinking he needed mental help. The saying goes: “The healing power of nature.” And this was coined because nature has the power to heal and is an essential part of our health. A large body of evidence has been reported that spending time in nature is responsible for many measurable beneficial changes in the body, and so is hugging a tree. Tree-hugging is not a weird act as many people may think. Recent studies have also linked nature to symptom relief for health issues like heart disease, depression, cancer, anxiety and attention disorders. Here are the benefits of hugging a tree: 1. It increases your happy hormones Oxytocin is a hormone responsible for feeling calm and emotional bonding. As you begin to practise tree-hugging, you stimulate parts of your brain that make you happier. 2. Transfers good energy According to Healthline, there is a scientific explanation for why the world has had a tree-hugging movement. “You are a living energy field. Your body is composed of energy-producing particles, each of which is in constant motion. So, like everything and everyone else in the universe, you are vibrating and creating energy.” 3. Healing A study found that spending time in the forest and around trees included four key benefits. These were reduced stress, improved immunity, lower blood pressure and accelerated recovery from illness or trauma.
