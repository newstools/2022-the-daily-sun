TATTOOS are seen as a visual expression of our personalities and identity. Many tattoo artists agree that most tattoos have a personal story to it, often linked to who we are. According to TatRing magazine, it is a snapshot of an idea, feeling, or memory you want to carry with you forever. It can also be visual proof that something or someone really happened. So what makes a great tattoo? According to Inked magazine, a good tattoo should be fully saturated in black, colour and shading. When it heals, there shouldn’t be any gaps or shapes to show it wasn’t filled in properly. If you are looking at getting a great tattoo this year, here are some ideas from The Trend Magazine: 1. Small tattoo  Less is more. The great thing about tiny designs is you’re not limited in terms of placement, and you can get them inked behind your neck, or even on your finger. These also tend to be more discreet, which appeals to people who want to cover them up, or don’t want to stand out. 2. Animal tattoo  If you have a favourite species or are inspired by certain qualities an animal is associated with, then it makes sense to get such a tattoo. 3. Portrait tattoo  Portraits tend to be the most expressive and call up the most emotions in terms of tattoos. Honouring a loved one or a celebrity who’s inspired you can be done through a portrait tattoo. It is a beautiful way to have a constant reminder of the significance of the person you have chosen to ink, but it requires a lot of skill. 4. Music tattoo  Music plays a vital role in our lives and uplifts us, improves our moods, and inspires us. This is even more true for those who play an instrument or have a deep passion for songs and sounds. 5. Angel tattoo  If you want to honour a loved one who has passed on or show your devotion to your faith, get an angel tattoo.
