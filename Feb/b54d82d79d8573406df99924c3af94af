A DAY after Police Minister Bheki Cele announced Inanda Police Station had registered the most murder cases, another killing rocked the area. On Saturday, 19 February two men were killed in a drive-by shooting in Inanda. Reaction Unit SA spokesman Prem Balram said the two victims’ bodies were discovered in a sugarcane plantation. “A motorist contacted Reaction Unit after he saw the occupants of a white BMW opening fire on a Toyota Avanza with high calibre rifles. “The caller informed the controller the Toyota was travelling from Inanda when the BMW overtook and opened fire. It veered off the road and into a sugarcane plantation.” Balram said officers and paramedics were sent and were met by Metro police. “First responders located the Toyota 50 metres from the road. It had been shot in excess of 20 times. There were no occupants. “Two separate blood trails were leading into the cane field in different directions. Officers followed the trails and discovered the bullet-riddled bodies of two men.” Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said charges of murder were being investigated.  “On the M27 Jabu Ngcobo Road, a vehicle was found in the sugarcane fields with bullet holes. Police found two bodies of males believed to be in their 20s with gunshot wounds. Both victims were certified dead at the scene. The circumstances are being investigated.”
