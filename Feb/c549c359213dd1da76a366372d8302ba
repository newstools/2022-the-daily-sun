Petrol hikes, which have become a norm in South Africa, are really worsening poverty. When petrol prices go up, poor people are the most affected because petrol prices affect food and transportation costs. The government needs to come up with a strategy to control its fuel levy. In a society where inequality, poverty and unemployment have skyrocketed, it is suicidal for government not to come up with a means to curtail petrol price hikes. Expecting the poorest of the poor to fork out more money to buy food at higher prices is painful. Not only that, the possibility of the taxi industry increasing transport fares can’t be ruled out because they are bearing the pain of petrol prices hiking too. Things are tough for almost everyone due to the economy not growing well and it is the responsibility of the government to cut the levy or come up with any strategy that doesn’t create a burden on motorists and all South Africans. There are some neighbouring countries such as Botswana that buy petrol from us but sell it cheaper to its citizens. So, our country needs to learn from other countries.
