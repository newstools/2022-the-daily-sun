HARARE cops found the body of an unknown male at Monwabisi Beach in Cape Town on Tuesday, 1 February around 7:30am. A spokesman for Harare SAPS Captain Siyabulela Vukubi said the deceased was wearing a white T-shirt and blue underwear. “He was certified dead on the scene,” said Vukubi. An inquest docket has been opened for investigation. Nangamso Sixhonto (45) said pastors need to go and pray at Monwabisi Beach. “Every week a body is found in Monwabisi Beach, people are being killed in the area and dumped there,” said Nangamso. He said it is time for pastors to organise a big prayer on that beach. “Pastors need to go there, light candles for all those who were killed there or dumped and also prayed that it stopped,” said Nangamso. He said Khayelitsha people need to stand up and do something about this. “If they have they must have people patrolling there, I am not sure if it is possible, but the killings that are happening are chasing investors away, who will want to invest their money in an area where people are being killed like flies?” asked Sixhonto. Zodumo Mvinjelwa said staying in Cape Town is very dangerous. “Staying in Cape Town especially in the townships is very dangerous, when going to work you are not guaranteed that you are going to make it, because you might get robbed and killed on the way to work,” said Zodumo. She believes that people staying in Cape Town kasis need prayers. “I know that most people that have been found don’t even get killed in Khayelitsha, people kill other people and dump them in Khayelitsha.” On Sunday morning, the body of an unknown man was found in Khayelitsha. A resident said every day forensic employees are picking up bodies in Khayelitsha. “We are used to this and we know that in the morning a body will be found, and there is nothing that can be done about this as I believe that the bodies are being dumped at night,” said the resident.
