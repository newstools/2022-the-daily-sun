PEOPLE call him Madala Sibancane because he’s young at heart and he loves it. And they call him this because he dresses like a skhothane. Madala Steven Kgabutle said he dresses to inspire other gogos and madalas to not look like they’re on life support. The 60-year-old from Chiawelo in Soweto, who makes belts for a living, said he has been dressing like this since he was 16 years old. He told Daily Sun he’s always loved fashion and what he wears has always been important to him, despite his age. But not everyone admires madala Steven’s fashion, but that does not bother him.  “It’s their opinion and it’s none of my business. I never let negative and silly comments get to me. I’ve always been like this. I just focus on the positive comments and move forward,” he said. Madala Steven said he’s bothered by elderly people who look like tired and worn out. He exercises by taking long walks every day. “The walk keeps me fit. I know that no matter how old I get, I won’t be sick because I eat healthy and take walks,” he said. His son Kabelo (29), who’s always loved his fashion sense, dresses in pantsula style.“I want to inspire more people to be fashionable, especially people my age. Looking good is good for your confidence. “If you feel good, no one will have power to make you feel small or weird, the power is in your hands,” he said. Kabelo said he’s always loved how his father dresses and that’s why he decided to dress like a pantsula. He said it’s special and represents kasi culture. “I also plan to dress beautifully until I go to my grave. I’m grateful my father taught me well.”
