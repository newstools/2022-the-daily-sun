Senegal were by far the better side in the 2021 Afcon final, far better than Mo Salah's Egypt, but failed to capitalise on numerous opportunities to win the game with Sadio Mane missing a penalty earlier on. But again it was Sadio Mane who stepped up to make history for the West African nation in Cameroon’s Olembe Stadium, scoring the penalty that secured his team’s 4-2 victory in the penalty shoot-out. That kick made history for the West African nation on Sunday at the Olembe Stadium in Cameroon’s Yaounde, and banished the memories of the team’s 2019 failure when they lost the final to Algeria. It was the first time that Senegal win Afcon, and they will also spot a star on their emblem. Dakar became the centre of massive celebrations after they erupted on Sunday night after Senegal claimed their first Africa Cup of Nations title in a penalty shoot-out over seven-time winners Egypt.
