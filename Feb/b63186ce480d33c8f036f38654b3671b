HIGH heels might seem like cool feminine shoes for women, but it has not always been like that. The origin of high heels can be traced back to 15th century Persia when soldiers wore them to help secure their feet in stirrups. According to reports, Persian migrants brought the shoe trend to Europe, where male aristocrats wore them to appear taller and more formidable. A pastor from Togo has been trending on social media after photos of him in several different types of heels were posted. The unidentified pastor seems very comfortable in his heels as he is seen changing his footwear choice and colours. A post shared by GossipMillNaija (@gossipmilltv)
