TAXIMEN at Bosman Taxi Rank in Tshwane said by the time the Taxi Relief Fund comes, it will be too little, too late. They said they will never recover from the negative impact caused by Covid-19, which left many without jobs while others had to return vehicles as they couldn’t pay. Speaking to Daily Sun, Daniel Mashao, a taxi owner and member of Pretoria Mabopane Pietersburg Taxi Association, said they have been waiting for this money for too long even though it will not make a difference. “We applied and received messages that our applications were approved, but we are not going to bank on this money because it’s too little,” he said. He said many drivers had to stay home as owners had lost their vehicles. “We’re told we will get R5 000, but what will I do with it? We complained that this money was too little and even held protests, but that didn’t help. The minister needs to do something,” he said. George Lusenga, also a taxi operator from Pretoria Mabopane Pietersburg Taxi Association, said it will take time before they recover. “A lot of vehicles were repossessed. The money we are supposed to get won’t even pay one instalment.” Lusenga said the delay in the permit renewal process was a major problem. On Tuesday, 22 February, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, said the taxi industry was the biggest industry with lots of challenges, which should be resolved. “We must do everything to help taxi operators access the money as little as it is.” Mbalula told taxi operators the department was working to extend the date for relief fund applications.
