GROWING up, Thomas Khumalo wanted to be a mechanical engineer, but due to his home situation, that never happened. Now, the 61-year-old from Mangweni Village in Nkomazi, Mpumalanga, goes around his community picking up rubbish and steel pieces to build small boats, aeroplanes and other models. He said this helped him develop his skills and keeps the environment clean. “I used to be a cattle herder and came across toys like boats and aeroplanes. I became so interested in how they were made. I imagined myself creating them,” Thomas said. “So, I started collecting rubbish and began my project.”  Thomas told Daily Sun people mocked him because they didn’t understand his initiative. They only realised later that he was doing something educational for young people. “I’m doing this to help young people realise that they don’t need to have a lot of money to turn their dreams into reality. Start with what you have,” he said. Thomas goes around collecting stuff other people consider useless and makes them. In the process, he helpss keep the environment clean. “I will continue crafting more things and transfer my skills to the youth who look up to me. “Some children are inspired already. “They come to my place and show interest.” Thomas hopes to get a bigger place and funds to keep his project going. “I’m not planning to sell my stuff. I want to keep use it as learning tools,” he said. His dream is to one day be able to craft moving boats and aeroplanes for people to use.
