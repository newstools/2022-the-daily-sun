ESKOM has launched an investigation after the power utility’s security guards were attacked at a substation in Winterveld, Tshwane. Eskom said on Sunday, 20 February, two-armed response security guards went to the substation and joined two static guards for a routine patrol. “At around 10.30pm, the static guards opened the gate for the other two to leave the substation. As they were about to get inside a car to drive off, four suspects suddenly appeared. They started shooting randomly while advancing towards the four guards,” read a statement the utility issued on Thursday, 24 February. Three guards sustained gunshot injuries and were robbed of their firearms and cellphones. “The suspects fled the scene and one guard reported the incident to the control room. The injured guards were treated in hospital and discharged two days later,” Eskom said. Quality and security manager Kith Maitisa condemned this act of criminality, and pleaded with the public to help. “Public members are encouraged to report suspicious activities anonymously to Eskom Crime Line on 0800 11 27 22 or go to the nearest police station. The case is under investigation by Eskom and the police,” Maitis added.
