Moonchild spoke to Daily Sun about her engagement back then and said they’d always spoken about getting married and were planning on getting married outside of the country. “I haven’t been planning the engagement for a long time, but Gontse and I always spoke about it. The way we’ve spoken about marriage is pretty cool. I’m not scared because I know it’s not necessarily attached to permanence by force. It’s about how you manoeuvre. So I’m excited,” she said. Moonchild also advised MacG and his co-hosts how to better their wording to avoid being cancelled by people on social media.
