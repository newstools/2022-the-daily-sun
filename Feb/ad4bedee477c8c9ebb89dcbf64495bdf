CULTURAL and Creative Industries Federation of South Africa president Joy Mbewana has landed a role on Durban Gen. She will be playing Nontobeko, a sickly mum. Speaking to Daily Sun, Joy said: “I’ve started shooting and will start appearing in April. “I can’t disclose much except that I am excited to be back on screens. The cast and crew gave me a warm welcome.” Joy said acting had always been her first love. “I’ve been longing to go back to acting but time wasn’t on my side. I recently got a role on Imbewu: The Seed, but I had to turn it down due to my schedule. “This time around, I decided to go back to acting full-time. I’m an actress before I’m the federation leader.” Joy said she saw many similarities between herself and her character.

We haven’t been able to work so when this opportunity came, I grabbed it with both hands. “I was born an artist and one day, I’ll leave leadership roles and focus on my craft. My talent will never leave me but leadership roles will.”
