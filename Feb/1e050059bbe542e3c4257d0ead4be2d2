Soldiers picking through charred debris scattered near the smouldering remains of a truck and a few civilians taking fresh air before a curfew were among scarce signs of life in Ukraine's capital on Saturday, after a second night of artillery barrages. Russian forces have been pounding the centuries-old capital Kyiv and other cities with cruise missiles and shells since the start of an invasion on Thursday morning. Many shops were closed, including those selling food, and the streets were empty except for a odd car - a contrast to the columns of vehicles choking roads in recent days as tens of thousands of residents fled west - and a few pedestrians pulling suitcases. "I was smart enough to stock food for at least a month, we have everything," said Serhiy, a middle aged man who said he started buying extra groceries for his family well before the violence broke out. "I did not trust politicians that this would end peacefully," Serhiy said, taking a walk before a curfew that kicked in at 5:00 p.m. Four heavily armed soldiers manned a checkpoint near a government building. Amid reports of Russian saboteur groups in the city, passengers in cars were required to keep their hands in the open and show identification papers without sudden moves, a Reuters team reported.
