NICK Cannon received an amusing gift, and the perpetrator of the prank has now been identified. On Monday, 7 February, comedian Kevin Hart revealed via Instagram that he was the one who delivered a vending machine full of Magnum condoms to the Wild ‘N Out host – a not-so-subtle hint that he preferred Nick to have protected sex rather than continue expanding his growing fleet of children. According to HipHopDX.com, Nick and Kevin have been embroiled in an ongoing prank war for months. Last September, Nick redesigned the outside of Kevin’s private jet by slapping an image of his own face across the side. Nick then surprised Kevin with a leopard for his birthday last July. Then a few weeks later, Kevin plastered Nick’s phone number on massive billboards in multiple major cities across the USA, instructing his fans to call him for parenting advice.
