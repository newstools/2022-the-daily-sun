A NEW
Zealand couple has gone viral for trying to sell their house in a bizarre way. Lawrence
Simpson (34) and wife Clarissa Turner (29) took a creative and cheeky approach
to sell their home by posing naked in listing photos of their cute A-frame
cottage in the foothills of the Southern Alps near Queenstown. According
to Stuff, as of earlier this week, the post had received 11 000 views on local
listing site Trade Me. “Lifestyle
getaway, plus glacier views!” the couple advertised their home, for which they
were currently asking $315 000 (about R4,7 million) for the house listed in
September. Meanwhile,
nothing was said about the owners appearing naked, though rather with a
watering can and book strategically placed to keep the images PG-rated. The listing
further noted that the home was on two acres of land, had a greenhouse,
rainwater tanks, solar lighting, composting toilet and lofted bedroom. The New
York Post reported that the two said they had a decent amount of interest on
the listing so far. “Most of
that has come from Christchurch residents seeking a holiday home as well as
individuals curious about whether the naked couple comes with the property.”
