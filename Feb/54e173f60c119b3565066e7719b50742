BAROKA coach Kgoloko Thobejane says his lads are hungry for football and cannot wait for their Nedbank Cup last-32 showdown against Stellenbosch FC at Danie Craven Stadium on Friday (6pm). Bakgakga have not been playing competitive football for almost two months as the Premier Soccer League was closed last December for festive season and the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals in Cameroon which ended on Sunday. “It has been a while since we played competitive football,” said Thobejane. “Practising and playing friendly matches is not like playing a league or cup game. “We are excited and looking forward to this clash. The boys cannot wait to play again.” The Ga-Mphahlele-based outfit rose to prominence when they reached the Ke Yona semi-finals in 2011 while playing in the Vodacom League (third tier) beating Premiership giants such as Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows with Sello Chokoe leading the then minnows. And now Thobejane has vowed that his side’s goal is to do better in this competition, which has a purse of R7m to the winners than in 2011. “South African started to know about Baroka because of the Nedbank Cup and we want to do well this time,” Thobejane added. “So we are in the tournament to fight to go all the way to the final. “Since the league closed last year, I had enough time to work with the boys without unnecessary pressure. “I am confident that we will do well in our league run and move away from the relegation zone soon. We are heading to Cape Town confident we will advance to this competition’s next stage.”
