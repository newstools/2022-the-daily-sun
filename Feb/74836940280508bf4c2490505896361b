INKATHA Freedom Party (IFP) has appointed Sanele Zondo as leader of its youth brigade. Zondo, who is currently IFP Youth Brigade’s deputy national chairman, will fill a vacancy left by the late Mthokozisi Nxumalo, who died in a car crash in August. Speaking to Daily Sun, Zondo said he was honoured to be trusted with such a huge responsibility and it gave him pleasure that the party trusted young people to tackle their own issues. He said his job was not to fill Nxumalo’s shoes, but to continue with the plans they had talked about before his death. “I am my own person and I have my own shoes to wear, and Nxumalo was his own person. We had the same ideas that I am going to continue to fight for in Parliament.” Zondo said he also wanted to address the issue of ex-convicts’ criminal records. “I will need to engage with Minister of Justice Ronald Lamola. We can’t continue to call our prisons rehabilitation centres when ex-convicts are unable to do anything when they are released. “They are called rehabilitation because a person gets rehabilitated but when this person has gained qualifications in prison, where are they supposed to work when they are blocked by criminal records?” said Zondo. IFP national spokesman, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, congratulated Zondo. “We are confident that like his predecessor, he will boldly represent the youth of South Africa and champion issues that impact their daily lives.”
