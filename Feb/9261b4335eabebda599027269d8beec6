FOUR men were arrested for allegedly robbing and murdering two pensioners, aged 64 and 83. Police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said the arrest of the four suspects, aged between 18 and 30, came after the victims’ bodies were discovered at a house in Carolina, Mpumalanga, on Tuesday, 22 February. “At around 7.10am, police were called to attend to a crime on Voortrekker Street. According to information, some residents at a communal home became worried when they did not see their elderly neighbours for a while and contacted the police,” Mdhluli said. “Members discovered the two bodies and they were certified dead at the scene. Police found items belonging to the victims appeared to have been taken by the suspects. These included a Toyota Corolla and a firearm. “The vehicle was abandoned not far from the scene.” Mdhluli said cases of murder and robbery were opened. “Information regarding the suspects’ whereabouts was obtained from certain members of the public. Details were followed up and the four men were nabbed at Carolina,” he said. “They are facing charges of two counts of murder and robbery as well as possession of suspected stolen property.” The suspects will appear in the Carolina Magistrates Court soon.
