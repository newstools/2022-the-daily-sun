THERE are massive fuel hikes well above R1 per litre on the cards for all grades of fuel going into March. This was according to the Automobile Association (AA), commenting on Central Energy Fund (CEF) fuel price data released today. “Data show an increase of R1,25/L for 95 octane petrol, R1,24/L for 93 octane, R1,29/L for diesel and a significant increase of R1,22/L for illuminating paraffin,” the AA said. An analysis of the movement in fuel prices so far in February showed that international petroleum prices were contributing entirely to the expected increases, with the stronger Rand buffering what would have been more significant increases. “The Rand is currently trading in a more positive band than it has for some weeks, with the local currency shaving around 17 cents off oil’s negative movement. Without this, the expected increases could have been between R1,40/L and R1,47/L for fuels across the board,” the AA said. Given the current outlook, petrol prices in Mzansi would skyrocket above R21 for the first time, with 95 octane petrol in Gauteng costing around R21,39/L and 93 octane petrol costing R21,13/L, outstripping the record high of R20,42/L last December. The coastal price of 95 octane would also now breach the R20/L mark for the first time, rising to R20,67/L based on the current data. Diesel and illuminating paraffin would also increase to levels never before seen. Seen year-on-year, these increases, forecast by the CEF, showed substantial percentage increases from March 2021. The price of 95 octane petrol inland, for instance, could rise from R16,32 a year ago to R21,39 in March, a 31% increase. Diesel could rise from R14,12 in March 2021 to R19,33 in 2022, a 37% hike. The biggest leap, though, was in illuminating paraffin – a fuel used by many for heating, cooking and lighting. In March 2021, the cost of IP stood at R8,45/L. Considering the expected increase of R1,22/L for this fuel, the price in March 2022 could reach R13,19/L (off its current R11,97/l), which would represent a whopping 56% increase year-on-year. Although the expected increases were significant, Efficient Group chief economist Dawie Roodt noted they were in line with current economic data. “These increases aren’t unexpected, and are supported by the numbers, especially those related to international oil prices,” he said.
