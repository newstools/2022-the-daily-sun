ZULU traditional prime minister and Inkatha Freedom Party founder Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi has been discharged from hospital. The 93-year-old spent a week in an undisclosed hospital after he experienced high blood pressure last Monday and subsequently felt unwell and was admitted to hospital on Tuesday, 25 January. Buthelezi, who is also one of the oldest Members of Parliament, was discharged from hospital on Tuesday, 1 February and he is preparing himself for the upcoming opening of parliament and the State of the Nation Address Debate. Family spokesman Dr Bhekuyise Buthelezi said as the family, they wish to thank the many friends and supporters who expressed good wishes for the speedy recovery of the prince. “We are pleased to report that, following a brief period of recuperation and testing, he has been given a clean bill of health and he was discharged from hospital on Tuesday. “It is good to have him back at KwaPhindangene, where he is preparing for the upcoming opening of parliament and State of the Nation Address Debate,” he said. Dr Bhekuyise said they also extend their deepest gratitude for the excellent medical care that he received. His sudden hospital admission at the age of 93 shocked many people after the prince survived after contracting Covid-19 twice – in 2020 and 2021. As the Zulu royal family is divided into two factions in the throne dispute between King Misuzulu and King Zwelithini’s first son Prince Simakade. Buthelezi, as the traditional prime minister, is leading the preparation of the official crowning of King Misuzulu as the Zulu king. Buthelezi led late Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu’s lawyers in reading the will that named Misuzulu king in April last year. He is the longest-serving Zulu nation traditional prime minister as he has served under his cousin King Bhekuzulu, King Zwelithini and he is currently serving under King Misuzulu.
