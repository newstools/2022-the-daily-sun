RESIDENTS came together recently to show ubuntu to a needy family. After seeing that a family at Browns Farm phase 6 in Philippi, Cape Town, was struggling, neighbours came to their rescue with food parcels. Community leader Phelisa Khanzi said after seeing a woman from the family going around and asking for food or piece jobs, they knew they had to do something. “I decided to ask other community members if we could assist. I knew they would agree because we are united and support each other,” she said. Phelisa said they held a meeting and agreed that everyone would buy what they could afford. “We are trying to bring back her dignity because not everyone will be welcoming when she asks for food,” she said. Phelisa said they couldn’t sit back and watch while someone was struggling. “What we did shows if we can work together, we can achieve a lot of things. We managed to buy her groceries and we will also try and involve other people to see if we cannot get a bed for her.” Beneficiary Nonikise Mafeyi (58) couldn’t hold back her tears. “I never expected this. Yes, they have been giving me food when I went to their houses but I now I’ll stop doing that,” she said. Nonikise said she lived with two other family members. “I would wake up in the morning like someone going to work because I wanted to get leftovers people throw away in the morning. I’m very fortunate to have a loving and caring community,” she said. Makalinde Mangi (47) said they would continue supporting Nonikise.
