A "highly virulent" variant of HIV-1 has been discovered in the Netherlands and according to Oxford University scientists, it appears to cause more rapid disease progression than other versions of the virus but you do not have to panic. People infected with this variant, named VB (virulent subtype B), have an average viral load that is between 3.5 and 5.5 times higher than usual for an HIV infection. (Viral load is a measure of the level of virus in the blood.)
