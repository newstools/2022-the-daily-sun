WILLIAM Maluleke started drinking booze at high school and has been doing so heavily since 2005. The 51-year-old from Ivory Park near Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said being an alcoholic had brought him suffering. He told Daily Sun he only thought of booze when he had money. “I am struggling to cope because of drinking. “I am living a miserable life and scared to lose my wife. I want to get clean and start living a good life with my wife and family,” he said. William said he was starting to suspect that he was bewitched. “I don’t want to return home when I am drinking alcohol. “I make sure there is no money left. And when I’m drunk I disrespect people.” He said his ID was with a mashonisa and he sometimes pawned his cellphones to buy booze. He said he currently owed four loan sharks more than R1 000. “I desperately need help. I am struggling to get jobs because of alcohol. “I want to work again and be a good father. “Please help me quit booze because it’s destroying my life,” said William. He added that he preferred his wife to be left out of his problem. Niece Selina Mathe (28) said: “My uncle needs help because he is an alcoholic and rehab will help him.” Social development spokeswoman Feziwe Ndwayana said: “William will get help. “We need an address so our social workers can conduct a house visit, and contact number of the next of kin.”
