RESIDENTS of C section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, are still shocked after they witnessed what they described as an assassination in broad daylight. This comes after a man believed to be a taxi owner was killed while another man, also a taxi boss, was injured. They were ambushed on Saturday, 12 February. The men were allegedly driving along Mzumbe Road and when they got to Malandela Road, a white Toyota Fortuner stopped in front of them and a group of armed men shot at their car. Apparently, the one taximan died from multiple gunshot wounds. The survivor was shot in the right hand as he jumped out and ran away. A resident said she was busy with her washing when she suddenly heard gunshots. “The shots sounded close to my home so I panicked and ran for cover.” ALSO READ: 74 YEAR MARRIAGE: EVERY DAY IS VALENTINE'S DAY!
