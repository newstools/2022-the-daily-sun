WHEN a couple is expecting a child, the two look at this as a blessing from God and their ancestors. Happy as they would be about the news, things can take a turn for the worse if they find out that the child isn’t theirs. This can happen through a hospital making the mistake of switching the children at birth or as a result of infidelity. These unfortunate incidents can lead to turmoil for the partners, and affect the well-being of the child. The Sun Team asked readers on social media what their reaction would be if they found out that a child they had been raising as their own, for four years, wasn’t theirs. Jonas Thapelo Wa-Nape Motloung said: “I will want the identity of the father and take the child there as a child needs to know who the father is, period.” Then Temabhele Bhelekati Gwebu said: “I would continue supporting them because chances are that you ran away from supporting your own flesh blood.” Doughlassaid: “Only women know the real father to their children.” Fanahsaid: “You have already started, finish what you have started.” Gamasaid: “After six years, my friend from high school found out that the first child is not his.” Seanego said: “By the way, it’s not men only. People need to learn to apply their minds. Women are also raising children that are not theirs. Babies are swapped at hospitals after birth.” Zamabhele said: “Let them burn; they can’t raise their own kids, mos.”
