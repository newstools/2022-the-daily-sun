A MUM and her five kids have been left homeless after her makhi accused her of stealing her husband and doing evil deeds. The 55-year-old mum from Doornkop in Soweto said her shack was destroyed last Sunday, 23 January. She said the residents held a meeting earlier that day, but she didn’t feel like attending. “But I was called to the meeting after my makhi brought a 5 litre bucket full of muthi, accusing me of an evil deed. “I was so shocked and didn’t believe what I was seeing,” she said. The woman told Daily Sun she had never used muthi in her life and was not even friends with the makhi’s husband. “We greet whenever we see each other. When she asked me what was going on between me and her husband, I told her nothing was happening. “I didn’t think she’d be this vindictive,” she said. The mum said she left the meeting and went to her mkhukhu but a few hours later, there was another meeting where they spoke about destroying her home. “Only one person questioned why they would do that without evidence, but I guess she was overpowered,” she said. The woman ran to the police station but was allegedly told cops didn’t deal with such cases. “When I came back from the police station, my home and furniture were destroyed. “I’m not safe,” she said. She said her kids came back from school crying as other kids said their mum was doing evil deeds. The mum, who has since been living with a friend, asked for help from SunReaders to rebuild her home. When Daily Sun contacted the neighbour, she hung up as soon as the reporter identified herself. Gauteng provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said a member of the community couldn’t be sent away by the police without help. Sello said this was unacceptable and asked for the woman’s contact details so she could help her.
