Minister of Police Bheki Cele has accused Economic Freedom Fighters leader of conniving with Mzansi’s top cop to kick Cele out of his position as a minister of Police. Cele said this while presenting his Sona debate at the City Hall in Cape Town today. Before he could present his speech, he gave the EFF leader Julius Malema his piece of mind, stating that he is not a president and must not tell Ramaphosa what to do. “Honourable Malema must wait and win elections, and appoint a cabinet, you don’t appoint a cabinet of other presidents. Wait, wait, maybe the time will come,” said Cele. He went on to claim that Malema met with the national police commissioner at a cops’ college in Tswane on 10 December 2020 where they hatched a plan to have him removed as minister of Police. “I’m not going to go back to the 10th of December 2020 where there was a meeting by yourself and the national commissioner and a plan and plot were hatched that I must be chased. I’m not surprised that today this is happening(calling for my removal),” said Cele.  Malema’s deputy Floyd Shivambu stood up on a point of order and demanded Cele withdraw his remarks which he said was “casting aspersions on the Commander in Chief”. Shivambu went on to say Cele “must be removed because he is useless” but insisted that the removal must not be read as if it is because of the alleged Malema meeting with the top cop. Malema stood up and denied ever meeting anyone on the 10th of December, and dared Cele to repeat it outside the House. “I want him to repeat this 10 December statement outside where there is no Parliamentary privilege so that I can take him on. I have never met anyone oE3``1n the 10th of December. If he is truthful about it let him repeat it outside,” said Malema.
