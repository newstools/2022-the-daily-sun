RESIDENTS of Ledig village outside Rustenburg, North West, have called on the total shutdown of Bakubung Platinum Mine. This after the forced closure of the mine started on 24 January. On Thursday, 10 February, community members blocked the entrance to the mine as it attempted to start operations, barricading it with burning tyres. This followed their march to the mine to hand over a memorandum of demands on 26 January. They warned that the mine would remain closed until a formal agreement was made between the community and mine.  Bakubung ba Ratheo office spokesman Disele Phologane said the community was not happy with response from the mine, leading them to blocking the entrance again on Thursday. Phologane said the response did not have a tangible programme of action, as requested by the community. In a statement, the mine management said a formal engagement was held with the community, where a response was given on 27 January. “Further demands were made against the mine and a response was given on 8 February. The mine said it had obtained a court interdict but despite this, intimidation of employees and damage to property carried on. At this stage, law enforcement will have to deal with anyone who violates the interdict. The mine is working tirelessly to ensure a safe start-up of operations.”
