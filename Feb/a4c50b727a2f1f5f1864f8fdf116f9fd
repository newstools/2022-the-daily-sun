PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa’s commended the leadership and all members of the armed forces for fulfilling their duties even when the country is struggling with many challenges. Ramaphosa was speaking during Armed Forces Day in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, on Monday, 21 February. The day is commemorated every year after the sinking of the troopship SS Mendi in the English Channel on 21 February 1917, during World War 1. More than 600 South African labour soldiers drowned when the troopship was struck by the SS Darro. Ramaphosa said the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has more than lived up to its task, particularly over the past year. He said they showed perseverance although they were under pressure. “As the commander-in-chief of the SANDF, I could not be prouder of you. Our nation could not be prouder of you. As a people, we are reassured that no matter the circumstances our nation faces, the SANDF will always be there. SANDF is one of the last lines of defence to restore order, maintain calm, support our people and defend the territorial integrity of our republic.” Earlier on, Ramaphosa, accompanied by Defence Minister Thandi Modise and the SANDF leadership laid a wreath at the Barberton War Memorial site. He said this was to honour all the men and women in uniform who lost their lives in the line of duty, at home and abroad. “Today, we pay homage to Corporal Tebogo Radebe killed in Cabo Delgado last year as part of the Mozambique SADC Mission. We remember all our soldiers who have fallen in the DRC, the Central African Republic and Sudan,” said the president. He also said government would look at ways to better resource the defence force to fulfil its amandate.
