 THE long Christmas and Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) break seems to have disturbed Kaizer Chiefs’ momentum. The Glamour Boys appear to be finding it hard to get going again, struggling to replicate some of their performances before the recess. They laboured to a goalless draw against Cape Town City at the Cape Town Stadium yesterday. And with that, Chiefs’ already slim chances of challenging Mamelodi Sundowns for the DStv Premiership got even smaller. They are a whopping 19 points behind the leaders having played four fewer matches than the men from Tshwane. It would take something close to a miracle for Amakhosi to pull off an upset and wrestle the title away from Downs’ firm grip. Chiefs have given their supporters little to be excited about since the resumption of their campaign. They are still looking for their first goal this year having failed to find the back of the net in two matches. Amakhosi came into the encounter against the Citizens smarting from a painful defeat at the hands of TS Galaxy in the Nedbank Cup. They crashed out in the Last-32 of the Ke Yona Cup for the second season running – suffering a 1-0 loss to bogey team Galaxy. The Citizens were also in pain having been sent packing in the cup by Royal AM after a  2-1 defeat. Amakhosi were hoping for their fourth win against City in their last five meetings in all competitions. But they were put on the back foot early with the Citizens the stronger team for the better part of the first half. Chiefs found their feet slightly in the second stanza, but they still lacked the cutting edge and had to settle for a share of the spoils.
