MAMELODI Sundowns cruised to the last-16 of the Nedbank Cup when they thumped Richards Bay FC 4-0 at Princess Magogo on Saturday evening. Sundowns went to this encounter as favourites, and they did not disappoint their fans as they did it in style, netting four goals with Keneddy Mweene keeping a clean sheet. Downs new signing Surprise Ralani scored on his debut to put his side in the driving seat in the 24th minute of the encounter. After that, Sundowns gained control of the game, not giving Richards Bay chances on transitions, but they also lacked the final pass in the last third and went to the break with a 1-0 lead. Sundowns flexed their muscles in the second half and scored three goals through Rushine De Reuck, Pavol Safranko, who came in as a sub and Peter Shalulile. Teboho Mokoena, who joined Sundowns from SuperSport United late last week, also made his debut when he was introduced in the second half of the match, replacing Rivaldo Coetzee. Natal Richboyz spent almost the entire second half of the match chasing shadows, with Down dominating them.
