THREE tsotsis were driving around, looking for targets to rob. Then they snatched a phone from a pupil who was walking by, and they paid a heavy price! One is dead and another in hospital while their car was also set alight by an angry mob in Makhulong in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. The incident happened on Thursday, 17 February. Constable Patricia Mgijima, spokeswoman at Tembisa Police station, said thugs had to be saved from the angry mob by cops, but one died. She said three men, aged between 20 and 30, were being accused of robbery by residents. “It is alleged that the three men, driving a white VW Polo sedan, snatched a pupil’s cellphone. The child cried for help and the alleged would-be-thugs were cornered, beaten to a pulp and their car set alight.” Mgijima said after receiving a complaint, cops rushed to the scene, where they managed to rescue two men, but the community turned their anger on them. They had to call back-up to help disperse the mob. She added that the third suspect was saved by paramedics who ferried him to hospital, but he later succumbed to his injuries. Mgijima said no one came forward to open a case of robbery against the three men, but cops opened one of assault GBH and murder. Residents said they were tired of crime in the area. “We don’t know who called the police. We wanted to teach them a lesson,” said one resident. Brigadier Roopchand Sookraj urged community members not to take the law into their own hands, and to open a criminal case because if not, then they were left with no choice but to release alleged suspects. “Police have a mandate – to protect and serve the community, maintain law and order, prevent crime and investigate, thus protecting anyone’s life is a priority.”
