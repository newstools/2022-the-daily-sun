GLENCOE detectives in KZN are appealing for assistance in locating Bheki Buthelezi (47), who is a murder suspect. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala, it is alleged that on 11 February at 9pm, Siyabonga Buthelezi (23) was asleep in his house with his girlfriend at Sithembile township in Glencoe when the ex-boyfriend arrived. “He kicked the door open and the girlfriend ran out of the house to get help from neighbours. Buthelezi was stabbed in the neck and chest. He managed to run out of the yard to a house nearby, where he fell down and died shortly afterwards,” Gwala said. She said the suspect fled the scene after the incident, and has been on the run ever since. Gwala said a case of murder was being investigated by Glencoe cop shop. “It is suspected that he might be in Empangeni. We appeal to anyone with information regarding his whereabouts to contact Captain Maharaj on 082 411 7162 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111,” she said.
