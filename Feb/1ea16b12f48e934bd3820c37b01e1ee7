MABOPANE licensing operations were suspended from Thursday, 24 February to Monday, 28 February. Driving school owners blocked entrance to the centre in Tshwane with burning tyres, threatening all who wanted to go inside. Gatvol of the NaTIS online booking system and the service from the Road Traffic Management Corporation, they described it as a tuck shop. They said people pay for poor service. Thapelo Moeketsi (31) said they used data to book appointments online, only to be told there were no openings. They wanted the department to revert to a walk-in system. “The job of government is to give us services, not sell them.” Driving school owner, Sibusiso Nkosi (50), said his area had network problems. “How do you expect me to use the internet when I didn’t even go to school? This is killing our businesses.” Resident, Bob Monyai (65), said he struggled with the system. “Kids are jobless when they could be working to assist us at these centres.” Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesman Simon Zwane said protesters never spoke to them. “Glitches were resolved and the system is now stable. We’re getting feedback and making necessary improvements.”
