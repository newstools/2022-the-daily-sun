AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy stressed “we want to show people we belong at this level” and progress to the Caf Champions League knockout stages. Usuthu host Guinea’s Horoya AC in their second group stage match at the Moses Mabhida Stadium this evening (9pm). McCarthy wants to emulate Kaizer Chiefs’ performance of last season in the Champions League and reach the final. Chiefs punched above their weight to reach the final even though they had a depleted squad. McCarthy said he was encouraged by the fighting spirit against Raja Casablanca over the weekend despite losing that away opening group clash 1-0. However, McCarthy cautioned that they will need to be clinically good as that was their downfall in Morocco. Winning home matches in the group stages is vital and McCarthy has prioritised victory over Horoya in Durban. “If we can show the same mentality and be clinical in front of goals, I think we have a chance to progress,” said McCarthy. “We don’t want to just make up the numbers, we want to compete and we want to show people that we can belong here for many seasons to come as long as we are in this football club.” While Usuthu are new to this Champions League Horoya coach Lamine N’Diaye has tons of experience at this level. The 63-year-old has won the Champions League with DR Congo outfit TP Mazembe in 2010. Mazembe became the first African club to reach the Fifa Club World Cup in the UAE. Mazembe lost to Italian giants Inter Milan in the Club World Cup final. N’Diaye also helped Mazembe win the Caf Super Cup trophy twice in 2010 and 2011. But McCarthy said N’Diaye’s experience will count for nothing because he himself was a good player. “What you have done in the past counts for nothing. “As much as he’s got a brilliant coaching career, I also had an unbelievable playing career and that doesn’t make any difference. Having lots of credentials, that doesn’t win you games,” said McCarthy.
