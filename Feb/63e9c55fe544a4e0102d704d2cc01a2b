Police Minister Bheki Cele was ordered to withdraw his accusation that EFF leader Julius Malema conspired with national police commissioner Khehla Sitole to have him removed. Cele made the allegation during Monday's debate on President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address (SONA) after opposition speakers roundly criticised him. He said Malema met with Sitole on 10 December 2020 in Pretoria, where "the plot was hashed that I [Cele] must be changed". "It is not a surprise he [Malema] comes here and changes a Cabinet he does not have. The Honourable Malema will have to wait, win an election, have a Cabinet and appoint the Cabinet," Cele added. Malema challenged Cele to repeat this outside Parliament, where he would not be protected by parliamentary privilege. Cele said he would repeat it on Friday when he presented the latest crime statistics. EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu objected, saying Cele "cast aspersions on the Honourable Malema, the commander-in-chief". "He must, of course, be removed because he is useless," added Shivambu, to which ANC MP Bheki Radebe objected, saying it was "offence language" to call a minister "useless". Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said Shivambu had raised a point of order and then broke the rules himself.          EFF MPs Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, and Natasha Ntlangwini then raised several points of order, complaining Cele did not withdraw on a microphone. "You are not useful if you do not become fair," Ndlozi said to Tsenoli. "Let him show us how big his balls are. Let us hear it," Ntlangwini said, presumably about Cele. ANC deputy chief whip Doris Dlakude said: "We are supposed to be honourable members of Parliament, and the use of offensive language is not allowed."
