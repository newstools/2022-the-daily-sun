POPULAR producer DJ Stokie has rubbed Kabza De Small up the wrong way. This after the award-winning producer spoke about his music journey and the birth of amapiano. Stokie, whose real name is Setoki Mbatha, shared on how Kabza (Kabelo Motha) was there for him and helped when he was putting together his album. However, he also revealed that things between them changed along the way, and the brotherhood was no longer what it used to be. “Even now, if Kabza called me in the wee hours saying he’s stuck somewhere, I would wake up and go help him, but I won’t necessarily get the same from him. It’s life, that’s how it goes. I love the guy, but I know now it’s better not to have too many friends,” he said. The claims were made by Stokie in an explosive interview that has since been widely circulated.

I did your first album yonke bra, and that is how you thank me? I gave you hits,” he wrote. But his response didn’t sit well with fans, who called him out for being big-headed. Others felt that he was right as they felt Stokie was attacking him. Social media user Thami Mnguni said: “Stokie was straight up attacking Kabza on that interview. He somehow feels like Kabza owes him for all he did back in the day, and that mindset is total bull. They should just talk it out. Sicela i-peace magents.”
