FORMER Miss South Africa Shudufhadzo Musida is set to host a Valentine’s gala concert, to take place at the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Speaking on his reasons for roping in the beauty queen, chief executive and artistic director of the popular orchestra Bongani Tembe said he was impressed by Shudu’s advocacy campaign that was built around bringing awareness to issues of mental health. “Her work done to empower women and children has been admirable. She is a role model for us all, whom we have invited to be part of the first of many concerts we intend to host. We asked her to introduce and describe the musical items,” he said. According to organisers, this will mark one of Shudu’s final appearances before she returns to compete in the Miss World pageant in Puerto Rico in March. The prestigious pageant, supposed to be held in December 2021, was postponed due to health and safety issues. The glittering line-up for the first concert, to be held at The Linder Auditorium on 12 February, includes acclaimed soprano opera singer Zandile Mzazi, internationally recognised jazz saxophonist Karendra Devroop and accomplished musician Khanyi Mthetwa, principal flautist of the JPO – conducted by Daniel Boico. The programme features favourites by Strauss, Tchaikovsky and Debussy, as well some smooth South African jazz sounds. “Curfews imposed during Covid-19 have changed audience goers’ time expectations, hence we introduced the earlier time of 6.30pm. This means we will conclude at 8.30pm, allowing people to enjoy the concert and still go on to dinner if they want,” Bongani said. He added that in adherence to current regulations, there would be a reduced capacity audience. “To guarantee the health and safety of our patrons, we will insist on proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test that is not older than 72 hours to gain entry. Early booking is advised,” he said.
