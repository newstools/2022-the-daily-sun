Around 60 Wits University students were hospitalised after they fell ill at a student residence in Johannesburg. Paramedics were called to the scene in Parktown at around 18:00 on Sunday, after " numerous students complained of shortness of breath",  ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "On arrival, emergency workers found that numerous students, aged 18 and upwards, had already evacuated the buildings and were...crowding the sidewalk and street," Meiring added. "Medics set up a triage area and began to tend to the patients, assessing approximately 170 people." Wits University spokesperson Shirona Patel said the incident took place in a dining hall. The hall has been closed since. Around 60 people were transported to hospitals in the area. The rest declined further treatment, Meiring added. "The exact details surrounding this incident are unknown, but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations," Meiring added. He said a gas leak was suspected. However, Patel said the cause of the illness was unclear. "The university can confirm that a group of students from one residence cluster presented with similar symptoms last night. It seems like they were all eating at one dining hall. All the students have been treated and are back on campus and recovering well. We take this matter very seriously and we are earnestly investigating the source of the problem - we should know more about the cause later [on Monday]." City of Johannesburg EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi did not have any details about the incident at the time of publication. SOURCE: NEWS24
