UNIVERSITY of Pretoria pulled a giant-killing act when they defeated Chippa United 2-0 to knock them out in the Nedbank Cup last-32 on Saturday afternoon at Tuks Stadium. Goals from Lulama Maqoko and Kamohelo Pheeane in the 80th and 81st minute of the match were enough to send AmaTuks in the last-16 of the tournament. Chippa United, last seasons runners up, had a promising start to the match and nearly took the lead in early as two minutes when Ronald Pfumbidzai saw his looping header tipped over the goal by Tuks keeper Thakasani Mbanjwa.The hosts threatened to break the deadlock five minutes later as Thabang Sibanyoni raced through on goal, but his attempt to round Ayanda Mtshali did not succeed. The match was then halted for nearly half an hour due to lightning strikes in the area, and when the action eventually resumed, Etiose Ighodaro wasted a glorious chance to open the scoring on 19 minutes when he headed wide at the back post from Ayanda Mvambi's cross. Thokozani Sekotlong should have done better for the Chilli Boys after being fouled just outside the box on 27 minutes, but the forward failed to hit the target from the resulting free-kick. The cup-tie remained goalless at the break, although Chippa were quickly on the attack in the second half, and Veluyeke Zulu missed the target with a header in the 49th minute. Pfumbidzai was presented with an even better opportunity 10 minutes later but somehow steered his header over the crossbar from inside the six-yard box. Substitute Mogakolodi Ngele tried his luck from a distance in the 70th minute after being afforded time and space, but his shot sailed wide of the mark. However, AmaTuks ramped up the pressure in the closing stages, and their efforts were rewarded with two goals in quick succession. The visitors were caught cold after Maqoko beat Mtshali in the 80th minute. Pheeane scored the second goal moments later to secure victory for the Pretoria outfit.
