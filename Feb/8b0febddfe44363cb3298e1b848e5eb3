A FERRARI 488 Pista has been wrecked after crashing on a highway in Poland. The incident happened near Wyrzysk, when the driver of the R10 million 488 Pista lost control along the S10 highway. Carscoops reports that the mid-engined Italian supercar lost control and slammed head first into a crash barrier.  While an ordinary vehicle would have been brought to a quick stop by this barrier, the Ferrari was so low that it slid under the barrier, destroying its front end, windshield and roof.  Details about events leading up to the crash are unknown, but it is likely that the driver was caught off guard by the slippery road surface and simply pressed the throttle a little too hard, spinning up the rear wheels and sending the supercar straight into the barrier.  The Ferrari is clearly unrepairable as not only has the front been destroyed and roof caved in, but both sides have been trashed, as has the rear-end because of the crash with the barrier. There’s a possibility that the engine and transmission are still intact and might be salvageable but apart from that, we suspect almost every part of the car will be scrapped. The 488 Pista is the hardcore, track-focused variant of the 488 GTB and features a 3,9L twin-turbocharged.
