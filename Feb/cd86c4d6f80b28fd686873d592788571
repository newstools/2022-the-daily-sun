AN alleged rapist is on the run after he was granted bail early last year. Cops in KZN have now appealed to the community to help find the wanted suspect, Senzo Landlord Mbeje. According to Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the 35-year-old was bust for raping a 27-year-old woman at Cato Crest in Mayville eight years ago. “Allegedly on 6 September 2014 at 4.15am, the victim was on her way home when she came across three armed suspects. At knifepoint, they demanded money and cellphones. When she told them she had nothing, the suspects became irritated and threatened to harm her. One suspect pushed her down on the road and raped her, while the other two were keeping a lookout,” Mbele said. She said a case of rape was registered at Mayville cop shop and the docket was transferred to the Brighton Beach Family Violence Unit for further investigation. “The suspect was arrested and appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court but was released on a warning due to ill health. The case was adjourned to 28 January last year, however he failed to appear in court,” Mbele said. The suspect has been on the run and a warrant for his arrest has been issued by the court. The cops appealed to anyone with information about Mbeje’s whereabouts to contact Detective Constable Travis Bouvrie on 081 046 3162/ 081 418 1264 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
