TS Galaxy coach Sead Ramovic says his players should avoid getting into the comfort zone. This after they maintained their three games unbeaten run in all competitions on Tuesday when they held AmaZulu to a goalless draw in a DStv Premiership match at the Moses Mabhida Stadium to increase their chances of avoiding relegation. The Mpumalanga side are now sitting in 13th position on 17 points from 19 matches, and are three points ahead of bottom side Baroka FC. Said Ramovic: “We should not fall into the comfort zone or else we will fail. We need to work hard to improve and slowly start getting points against other teams because we still have 11 games in front of us.” Ramovic was unhappy that winger Orebotse Mongae missed a clear cut chance that could have secured them three points. “We didn’t start the game well, but became better after 15 minutes. We wasted a great opportunity to score and also AmaZulu. But in the end I think it’s a well-deserved point.” The enthusiastic Zulu leaner is aware that it won’t be easy to extend their unbeaten run as they face run away leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in their next league game at Mbombela Stadium on 2 March. “Sundowns is a bench mark in South Africa. They have a great team and great coaches (Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena). But when they come to us we will be underdogs and we are prepared to fight because we are representing our supporters, they have expectations and of coarse we have to win. “We need every point and it will be exciting to fight. We have to keep going, the confidence is high in the team. This is great for every coach.”
