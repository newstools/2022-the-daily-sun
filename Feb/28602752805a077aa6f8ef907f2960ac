Free State Stars coach, Duncan Lechesa, has quit the club to join Polokwane City again, according to our sources. In fact, according to our mole, Lechesa has been in constant conversation with City boss Johnny Mogaladi for weeks. This will be Lechesa's second spell with the Limpopo club after having spent almost a year with the club in 2013. It is unclear when will Lechesa take over the coaching reins, but SunSport understands that he is still in talks with his new employers about the structure of his technical team. Stars chairman, Rantsi Mokoena, confirmed that Lechesa has resigned on Tuesday. Innocent Mayoyo, who joined Stars in December last year, will take over the reins. Efforts to get hold of Lechesa proved fruitless having failed to respond to calls. Lechesa's mandate is to help City gain promotion back to the DStv Premiership, or even reach the play-offs stage. And this should not be a too bigger request from Mogaladi as the club is placed third on the GladAfrica Championship log with 28 points. Stars are seventh on the log with two less.
