THE different types and shapes of the human lips say a lot about our personalities, while the size of our rear end is often linked to our sexual appetite. This simply shows that our body parts can inform us about a lot of things and this can also be seen when we look at people with big toes. According to some studies, the length and shape of your toes say a lot about you as a person. According to Story-Pick, people with big toes are more intelligent and are creative thinkers. According to the publication, people with big toes often come up with ingenious solutions to problems and can see things from different angles and are never starved for ideas. This is also seen in people who suffer from what medical experts call Morton’s toe or Greek foot. This is a condition where the second toe is bigger than the rest of the other toes. According to Health magazine, having a Greek foot is associated with being a natural leader, having great intelligence, and even showing a royal demeanour. The magazine used public figure Meghan Markle as an example. The Morton’s toe was named after Dr Dudley Morton, who studied this curiosity during a career spent arguing that most foot issues come from one’s toes rather than weak or fallen arches.
