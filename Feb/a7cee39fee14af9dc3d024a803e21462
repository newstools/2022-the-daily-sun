Five people
have died in an accident involving a petrol tanker in Johannesburg. The
accident was reported on Wednesday just before 22:30 by an off-duty
firefighter. On arrival at the scene, emergency crews found that a car and a
petrol tanker had been involved in a collision. The petrol tanker was on its
side. The accident
took place at the intersection of Swartkoppies and Kliprivier roads, next to
Mall of the South in Johannesburg. "Both
vehicles were alight," said Ekurhuleni metro spokesperson William Ntladi. Firefighters
from the City of Ekurhuleni were assisted by crews from the City of
Johannesburg, and a specialised foam tanker and water tanker fire engines were
used to contain and extinguish the blaze, he said. According
to Ntladi, the five victims were travelling in the car and had been burnt
beyond recognition. They appeared to be family members, he added. The truck
driver and his assistant both sustained critical injuries and were transported
to a nearby hospital. "The
cause of the crash is undetermined and still under investigation by law
enforcement officials," added Ntladi. SOURCE:
