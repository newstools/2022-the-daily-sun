BONKO Khoza, who plays Mqhele in The Wife on Showmax, set tongues wagging after taking a bite off a hun’s plate of food in a restaurant. Luckily, she took it well and laughed it off. As much as she didn’t make a fuss out of it, this left Mzansi shocked. Some said they wouldn’t have minded if he took a bite of their food, but some were judging him, saying his actions were disrespectful.

I don’t think Brenda Fassie was out here biting people’s burgers but Mqhele has decided to take it to THAT level. Pioneer!” Kay Mahapa tweeted. Another tweep didn’t understand why people were so pressed when the lady didn’t have any problem with what Bonko did. “Mqhele overestimated his celebrity status a little bit. I don’t think he’s reached the level of celebrity where you can take a bite off someone’s plate and be met with expressions of both shock and excitement,” tweeted Mamcane Kim.
