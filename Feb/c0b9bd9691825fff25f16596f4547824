GOGO Mantsane Sekese (78) needs help to reclaim her identity before she dies. The gogo, who lives in Mzimhlophe Hostel in Meadowlands East, Soweto, has no one to take care of her. Her biggest challenge is not having an ID as she can’t get a grant. She told Daily Sun she was raised in Moletsane along with 11 siblings, but they had all died. “There were many of us and I was forced to leave home at an early age, staying in different places and sometimes with boyfriends,” she said. Mantsane wasn’t home when it was time for her parents to apply for her ID, and this has become her biggest frustration.  She went to Home Affairs but was told to bring a relative for a DNA test. “I had five children but they all died. I’m left with one grandchild, who treats me as if I don’t exist,” she said. “I can barely stand or walk long distance and I look very old. Who would give me a job? I struggle for food. If it wasn’t for my neighbours and the community forum, I would be dead.” She said her family had a home in Moletsane, but were unlawfully evicted. They moved to Kliptown but because of floods, then moved to Mzimhlophe. “I’ve been staying here for over 30 years,” she said. Daphne Makhavhu from Sizanani Community Forum said gogo was suffering. “Her health is bad and she hardly has healthy food to eat. “Sizanani hasn’t been able to help for the last two years because of Covid-19.” Daphne said gogo had the death certificates of two of her siblings and one child, and was hoping they could help. Home affairs spokesman David Hlabane said this was normally taken as a late birth registration. “The department wants a DNA test from an applicant because it is trying to establish whether or not she is a South African citizen. For gogo, we at least need to know the schools she attended to get records. We will do our best to assist.”
