Three people have been arrested in the Free State after they were allegedly caught red-handed drawing diesel from a parked truck. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said the trio was arrested near Ficksburg Port of Entry on Friday evening after police officers noticed a blue Toyota taxi with Lesotho licence plates parked next to a truck on the side of the road. "They decided to stop their vehicle and investigate. Three suspects were found busy draining diesel from the truck into 25l containers using a hose pipe. "Upon further investigation, they noticed that two 25l containers were already loaded in the taxi. The three suspects were immediately placed under arrest," Mophiring added. The driver of the truck later arrived and told police he had parked it on the side of the road and walked to the Port of Entry to declare the goods in the truck. Mophiring said the trio, aged 30 and 40, were expected to appear in the Ficksburg Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of possession of suspected stolen property and theft of diesel.
