EXPECT another action-packed and extremely busy year for top boxing promoter Joyce Kungwane of TLB Promotions. Kungwane has promised Mzansi boxing fanatics that an abundance of action is in the offing this year as she continues to deliver one event after another. TLB has quickly grown into one of the most dependable promotions for boxers in the province, with Kungwane making a name for herself in the process. Kungwane is set to deliver her first tourney of the year later this month in Kagiso, and this will whet the appetite for plenty more action that is to come. It will be a six-bout boxing spectacle at the Kagiso Memorial Hall on 27 January, with the main bout between Mzansi’s Junior Makondo and Jacques Muvud from the DRC. This bout will be for the vacant WBF middleweight title. In the main supporting bout, Khaya Busakwe will make his first defence of the Gauteng lightweight title. “This will be the first of many tournaments from TLB this year,” said Kungwane. “This tournament was supposed to have taken place last year, but we had to cancel. There are some changes here and there but most of the fights are the same. “We are looking forward to an exciting tournament. We always bring the action, and it will be no different this time around. “The fighters are ready to go, they look fit, they look sharp and ready to deliver a spectacle on the day. “The most exciting thing is that fans are allowed and they should purchase their tickets and experience a lovely afternoon of boxing.” In other bouts on the bill, Kholosa Ndobayini will take on Cecilia Pitisani in an international female lightweight battle. Youssof Mwanza from the DRC will face off against Alick Gogodo from Malawi in a cruiserweight fight, while Cayden Truste faces Rirothe Radima.
