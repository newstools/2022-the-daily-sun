MEDIA personality Lerato Kganyago shut down Valentine’s Day once again. This comes after people waited all day for her to show off what her man got her for the day and waiting to see if he is going to live up to last year’s extravaganza at FNB Stadium. As expected, the Metro FM host went live on Instagram and showed off what her husband, Thami Ndlala, had planned for her. Lerato has been working towards opening her own boutique hotel and the businessman gifted her with the renovations of the place that she had been planning to open, leaving everyone’s jaws on the floor and with many saying the day should be renamed to Lerato Kganyago’s Day.
