They spoke to Daily Sun after the pregnancy reveal and Ziphozenkosi said she is carrying a miracle baby. “This is a miracle baby. We were going through a lot. My mum was admitted to the ICU with Covid-19 and while we were trying to focus on my mother’s health, my workplace was looted. In the middle of all that, I fell pregnant. It was through the grace of God. I say this because we were not expecting this to happen,” she said at the time. Ziphozenkosi also revealed the baby was expected towards the end of March or beginning of April. Watch the gender reveal party video below. A post shared by ZiphozeNkosi Nzimande (@dr_ziphozenkosi)
