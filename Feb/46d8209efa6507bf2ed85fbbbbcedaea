AN INDIAN woman was recently arrested for adding drugs to her husband’s food over six years to kill him. According to India Today, the 36-year-old got married to her husband in 2006. It’s reported that soon afterwards, she started fighting with her 38-year-old husband over minor issues. The troubled man then decided to go to a doctor after noticing his health was getting worse. “This went on for six years and his health condition kept getting worse, despite medication. “Last September, he started avoiding the food cooked by his wife and noticed a significant improvement,” the article said. It is also reported that the husband suspected his wife of adding something to the food and asked his friend to investigate. Without hesitation, the woman allegedly confessed she was mixing medicine in his food. The husband apparently retrieved CCTV footage from inside the house and opened a case against his wife after which the police arrested her. The cops said she confessed to adding drugs to her husband’s food and water, saying he did not give her a share in his property. “He said he would share the property with siblings, therefore, I decided to take this step,” the woman told the cops. Investigations into the matter are continuing.
