SHE was invited to her friend’s house on 31 January. And when she arrived, she found her neighbour there. They enjoyed themselves until 9.30pm when she wanted to go home. “I was ready to sleep and I was not drunk at all. My neighbour said there was wine and some chocolate in his room. He said I can pass by and take them and I didn’t see anything wrong with that because he is my neighbour,” she said. So the 27-year-old woman from Blue Downs in Cape Town said: “As I was taking the wine, he grabbed me from the back and I couldn’t move. He then pushed me onto the couch, pulled down my jeans and panty, and raped me.” The suspect was arrested on Saturday, 5 February, after the woman posted his photos on social media. “I decided to help the cops by posting on social media and left my contact details there. Someone contacted me saying he knows where he is and they called the cops,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk said the 41-year-old man appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrates Court on Monday, 7 January.
