A TEENAGE boy became a hero after he saved his cousin from getting raped. Speaking to Daily Sun, the mum of the 14-year-old from Strand, Cape Town, said the boy went to stay with his father and his stepmother in the Eastern Cape along with her younger sister’s twin daughters. The woman said the stepmother’s 18-year-old son tried to rape one of the girls three times but her son stopped him. She said when her son reported the matter to his grandfather, the madala moered and accused him of causing fights. The mum then went to fetch her son and the girls, who are 12, and they were with her in Cape Town. The boy told Daily Sun that in October, he walked into his cousin’s bedroom while he was undressing one of the girls. She was then able to get dressed and leave. In November, he saw his cousin dragging the crying girl to his bedroom and in December, the cousin attempted to drag the girl again. On both occasions, he stepped in. After the last incident, the cousin slapped him. “When it happened the first time I told my grandfather, but he said I would cause a fight. I then told my mother, who asked him what was going on. He moered me for telling my mum.” The boy said after the first incident, he made sure he was always near the girls. “Whenever she was dragged to his room, I’d follow them to make sure he could not proceed with his plan. Even after he slapped me, I never stopped protecting the girls,” he said. The grandfather refused to speak to the Sun Team and said: “Get all the information from those who told you about this.” The mum opened a case, which was confirmed by police spokesman Joseph Swartbooi. “A case of sexual assault was registered at Lwandle Police Station,” he said.
