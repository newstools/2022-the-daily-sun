BAROKA FC coach, Kgoloko Thobejane, is a worried man and concerned about his charges failure to convert an avalanche of chances created in their matches. He made this statement on Monday after his boys bounced back from a goal down to score a last gasp equaliser via the boot of striker Richard Mbulu to hold Mamelodi Sundowns to a 1-1 draw at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. Thobejane believes the game was theirs to lose in the first half, but they wasted all the chances created. “We need to be deadly in front of goal at home and make this venue our slaughterhouse,” he said. “But sometimes it doesn’t pan out the way you planned it. There is only one challenge in football: the one that is killing us is poor finishing.” Thobejane was also not happy that youngster Basel Mphahlele missed a penalty that could have increased their chances of winning the match. “We missed a penalty,” he said. “We had to motivate the boys to say ‘keep pushing, you can make it’. “In the second half, they caught us off-guard very early. But we kept pilling pressure on them hoping we can score. “But at the end we managed to get a draw. I mean half a loaf is better than nothing.” Thobejane is aware they will need to start winning more games if they are to retain their PSL status, come end of the season. Bakgaga are third bottom on the Premiership table tied with Swallows FC on 14 points. Only a point separates them from bottom club TS Galaxy. The Limpopo side will face rookies Sekhukhune United in their next league game at Emirates Airline Park on Sunday (6pm). Added Thobejane: “It’s not that we are happy to get a point, we all want maximum points because the position we are in is not good. Hopefully we will do better in front of goal in our next game to win the match.”
