SUNSPORT has reliably learnt that Banyana Banyana defender Lebogang Ramalepe has been affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Ramalepe was stuck in Turkey on Thursday night due to the cancellation of flights to Belarus. She was part of the soccer team that recently defeated Algeria 3-1 on aggregate to qualify for the Women’s Africa Cup of Nation, set to take place in Morocco in July. Ramalepe left her teammates in Algeria to connect in Turkey as she was going to her club in Belarus. However, the airline made alternative arrangements for passengers, putting them in local hotels for some time. “All the flights going to areas, including Minsk, had their flights cancelled,” the informant told SunSport. “The SA Football Association (Safa) has now secured her a flight to Doha, Qatar, where she will link up with the homebound Banyana team expected to land back in Mzansi on Saturday morning.” Safa head of communications Dominic Chimhavi told SunSport that he had not heard anything about the incident, and asked for queries to be sent to Banyana coach Desiree Ellis. However, Ellis could not be reached for comment.
