OSCAR Mabuyane has called on the cops to leave no stone unturned as they investigate a recent spate of shootings. The Eastern Cape premier and provincial ANC chairman was responding to recent killings in Nelson Mandela Bay. On Sunday, 13 February, Councillor Mzwandile Booi was killed execution style after his car was ambushed by a gunman wearing a balaclava. This came just two days after former ANC councillor Mazwi Mini was shot while watching TV with his family at his home in Kariega. The shootings came as branch general meetings are taking place across the province to nominate candidates ahead of the provincial elective congress in March. Mabuyane and Babala Madikizela are competing for the provincial chair position. Mabuyane said: “According to the report we received, the attempted murder of Mini came after he was threatened at a ward 42 branch meeting. Our branch meetings can’t be scenes of violence simply because there are comrades desperate to deliver certain factional outcomes that have nothing to do with the interests of the ANC or the people. We are calling on the police to act swiftly in ensuring those behind these hits and violence at our meetings are brought to book.” He said they would not be intimidated in their struggle to cleanse the ANC of wrongdoing and rot in the ranks of the organisation.
