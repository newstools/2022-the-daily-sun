ACCORDING to cosmetic experts, there is more to applying make-up than meets the eye. From one’s forehead to their chin, what and how you apply it has a lot of aspects to it. According to dermatologists, if one did not cleanse properly, dirt and texture would build-up on the skin. This allowed for make-up products to not stick to your skin due to lack of adequate moistening and treatment. However, skin experts have said there is a golden rule to applying make-up. According to Her Campus, here below are some of the tips: 1. Make-up doesn’t transform Before applying anything to your face, it is important to understand that the purpose of make-up is not to change your face, but to enhance your natural features. Many people make the mistake of thinking they need more. But, less is more when it comes to make-up. 2. It doesn’t define you When you feel good, you look good. One of the most valuable life lessons is maintaining balance. Do your make-up, look in the mirror once and confidently walk out the door. You don’t need to touch up every 10 minutes. 3. Quality over quantity A great quality foundation and skincare range are important when it comes to make-up. These items provide the base for the rest of your make-up; therefore, quality must be top notch. These include eyeshadow, liner and mascara. 4. Give your skin a break Many people have it engrained that they can’t leave the house without make-up, which is not mandatory. Your skin deserves a break, especially after a long weekend of going out. Allowing skin to breathe also minimises the risk of unwanted breakouts, resulting in a happier, clearer complexion. 5. Practise makes perfect Make-up is a form of art, and coming up with new looks is a great creative process. But, you lose that creativity when you’re not confident. Beauty faux pas are almost inevitable, so keep an open mind when it comes to trial and error.
