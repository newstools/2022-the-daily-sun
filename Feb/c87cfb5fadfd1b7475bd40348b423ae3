KAIZER Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has explained Nkosingiphile Ngcobo’s omission from the match squad against Cape Town City. Ngcobo, who has been impressive for Amakhosi of late, was not part of the squad that took on the Citizens in the DStv Premiership on Tuesday. And this did not go down well with many of the club’s supporters who voiced their frustration on social media. Baxter has come under increasing pressure recently to field fan favorite Ngcobo. The British mentor has given the reasons for Ngcobo’s absence. “We changed personnel because we wanted a bit fresher legs,” explained Baxter. “Mshini (Ngcobo) didn’t play because he had a bacterial infection. He couldn’t play and we had sort of created a little role for him in that little number 10 position because he had been doing so well. “But we went away from that, and the changes had a positive effect. Of course, you’re not completely happy when you don’t win the game. ”Chiefs, who have collected 29 points from 17 matches, will now enjoy a brief break before they return to action next weekend against Baroka FC.
