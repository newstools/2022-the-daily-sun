THE delay in implementing the fourth industrial revolution in the police force may have led to the poor police response to the July unrest. Gauteng deputy police commissioner Major General Thomas Mthombeni, who was acting commissioner at the time, believes if the police had drones the response would have been better. Mthombeni was in the hot seat at the Human Rights Commission hearing into the unrest in Joburg on Tuesday 22 February. “Should we have had drones at the grassroots level, we would have been in a position to deploy. We would have been in a position to deal with some of the incidents precisely,” he said. With a few resources at their disposal, Mthombeni said the police did their best to end the unrest but admitted they were outnumbered.
