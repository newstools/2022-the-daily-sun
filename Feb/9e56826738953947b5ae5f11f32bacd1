THERE are certain things in life that we just can’t run away from. From personal hygiene to health matters, some things one just has to live by on a daily basis. These include eating food. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or supper, we all have to eat in order to keep our bodies functioning. While in-between snacks and cheats can also be counted as eating, the big question is: When is the right time to eat and enjoy your food? According to most dieticians, obesity is also a result of frequent and unmeasured eating patterns. And according to North-Western Medicine publication, there are ideal times of indulging in your favourite meal: 1. Breakfast This is all about breaking the fast of a night without eating. It also sets the stage for your nutrition for the entire day, giving you the energy you need to face what lies ahead. According to experts, plan to eat breakfast within an hour of waking up. This way, your breakfast doesn’t blend into a mid-morning snack. 2. Lunch time This meal should be about four to five hours after breakfast. For example, if you ate breakfast at 7am, eat lunch between 11am and noon. If it is not possible for you to eat lunch until 2pm on a particular day, then plan a snack in-between. 3. Dinner According to nutritionists, people tend to overeat at dinner because they have not eaten enough throughout the day. Dinner time should follow the same schedule as your earlier meals, making sure there is no more than a four- to five-hour window between lunch and dinner. Some people will need to eat a snack between lunch and dinner because eating this meal at 4pm or 5pm is not always realistic.
