CONSIDERING where they are coming from this past weekend, Swallows’ nest must be shaking in fear of Sekhukhune United’s sjambok for their DStv Premiership clash on Saturday. Sekhukhune’s midfielder Vusimuzi Mncube is aware the Emirates Airline Park will be a hive of activity tomorrow (5.30pm) where Birds will be fighting for their lives. On the other end, Sekhukhune will be determined to prove their incredible 4-0 DStv Premiership hammering of Baroka FC was no fluke, and they’d be out to repeat it against Swallows. Relegation haunts Swallows and they could dangerous if taken lightly, an impression created by Mncube. Babina Noko harbours hopes of ascending the log table, currently perched at sixth spot, tied on 28 points with AmaZulu who are behind them. Swallows are second bottom on 15 points from 20 games, and are a point ahead of basement side Baroka. “The preparations are going very well,” said Mncube. “As professionals, we know very well we need to guard against complacency. We need to replicate what we displayed on Sunday against Baroka.” The 28-year-old hopes to continue where he left-off against Baroka as he scored his first goal in the top flight. Sekhukhune are favourites going into the match having beaten Birds 1-0 during the first-round match played in November last year. MacDonald Makhubedu’s coached side also have a better home record having won four times, drawn three and lost twice. Swallows away record leaves a lot to be desired having won just one match with four draws and four defeats in nine outings. Explained Mncube: “It feels very good scoring my first goal for the team, and I am hoping to score more. It’s my first goal in the PSL, and I am hoping to help the team win more matches. “The mood in the camp is very high and the guys are in high spirits, and that’s what a win does to you.” The former JDR Stars player has appreciated their fans’ patience in good and bad times.
