SHE started being a sex worker five years ago. And today, the 35-year-old from Nyanga, Cape Town, services both men and women. She also services her old clients on credit. “I have loyal clients that I service on credit because I know they will never run away with my money,” said the woman. But, clients cannot just show up and expect a poke on credit. They discuss it on the phone before they go to her place. “My clients and I have an understanding and we respect each other. None of them come knowing they don’t have money,” she said. The woman said servicing both genders was not a problem for her. “At first, I was offering my services to men only. But one day, I received a message from a woman who asked if I also serviced them. I didn’t hesitate and said yes,” she said. She said she knew exactly what the woman needed and she didn’t disappoint. “If you don’t know how to do something, just askGoogle. You will get all the answers there.” The woman then started to service both men and women – as long as they were 18 and older. She said sometimes she got so busy that clients had to wait outside for their turn. She prices start from R100 for both genders. “The price depends on what the client wants. One short and sweet round is R100. Those who want more are not afraid to pay close to R500.” She urged people to stop criticising others. “Let’s respect other people’s hustles. If you were fortunate enough to get a decent job, that doesn’t mean you must look down on other people’s hustle,” she said. A resident applauded what the woman was doing. “I don’t care if she is selling to both genders, as long as she is making money without killing or hurting anyone.”
