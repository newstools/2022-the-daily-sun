ACTRESS Pebetsi Matlaila has shared that she might give love a second chance. The talented actress, who announced late last year that her marriage ended in tears, shared that she was open to getting married one more time. “Yes, I am open to the idea of getting married again. But first, we need to heal. Who knows, maybe the second time around I will experience what they call happily ever after. But for now, I am allergic to men,” she said. This comes after the Skeem Saam actress opened up about surviving near-death abuse. Speaking to Daily Sun at the time, Pebetsi said the abuse was unexpected. “I don’t want to bad-mouth him or reveal too much of what happened but yes, I suffered unexpected abuse from my ex-partner. We are both currently going through a process of healing, and we are no longer living together. I have been attending therapy and my journey of healing has been going well so far,” she said.

Emotionally, it has been a strain and physically, one has been trying to stay strong for the kids,” she said. She also revealed that to overcome the tough situations she was facing, she had been praying and giving everything to God. Late last year, Pebetsi’s long-term boyfriend paid lobola and shortly thereafter, she announced that she was pregnant.
