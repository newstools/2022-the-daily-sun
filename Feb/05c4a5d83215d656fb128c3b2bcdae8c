CHIPPA United coach Kurt Lentjies wants to go one step better this season by winning the Nedbank Cup. Last season, the Chilli Boys successfully juggled the Ke Yona Cup and the relegation battle. They won both battles, reaching the final of the tournament and were beaten 1-0 by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the cup final and avoided the relegation axe Chippa finished 15th in the DStv Premiership log to avoid automatic relegation and retained their PSL status via the promotion/relegation play-offs. Chippa kick-off their Ke Yona tournament with an away clash against the University of Pretoria at Tuks Stadium on Friday afternoon (3pm). “We are excited to get started. We are in the tournament to win it. We are looking at winning all the matches we play. We don’t have any mandate, but it would be great for us if we can do better than last season.” He admitted that it would not be a walk in the park. He stated: “Last season, we went all the way to the final. I don’t think we should think that it is going to be easy to get there again. AmaTuks will be motivated that they’re playing a PSL team and they won’t make things easy for us.” With the Nedbank Cup 15th edition kicking off today, the Chilli Boys find themselves in what looks like a similar situation. They are not safe in the Premiership, sitting in 12th position with 16 points. They are just three points ahead of bottom club TS Galaxy. But that does not faze them as Lentjies vowed that they are going for the jugular in both the league and Nedbank Cup. Lentjies, who was a player when Chippa lost in last season’s final, said they are aware of the danger posed by AmaTuks, but they are well prepared. “We want to strike the balance in the cup and the league, and obviously take the good form from the league to cup and vice versa,” Lentjies. AmaTuks will be returning to the Nedbank Cup last-32 for the first time in five seasons.
