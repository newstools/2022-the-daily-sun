BAROKA head coach Kgoloko Thobejane admitted that Bakgaga have a serious goal-scoring problem and needs to get it right, to avoid relegation. Thobejane was speaking following Baroka’s 1-0 defeat against Kaizer Chiefs in their DStv Premiership encounter on Saturday at Peter Mokaba Stadium. Chiefs goal was scored by Khama Billiat. The defeat has left the Limpopo-based side stuck at the bottom of the Premiership with 14 points with 10 league matches remaining. They face another crunch league clash tomorrow (5pm) when Baroka host Marumo Gallants in a Limpopo derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium. “We have a serious problem and need to work on it and fast,” said Thobejane. “We are creating chances but we just can’t score and this is a serious problem. We lack finishing and it is now a challenge.” On their defeat against Chiefs, Thobejane was full of praise for his players, especially goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke, who was named Man of the Match after the game for his impressive performance. “I think the performance from the boys was good,” he explained. “They worked hard and you can see that with Masuluke being named Man of the Match. We need to build on this form going to next game (against Gallants). We played according to our plan but it was not meant to be.” The under-fire Thobejane is optimistic that his side will avoid relegation. “We are under pressure because of the position we are on,” he said. “We are going to fight until the end. We still have 10 games to go and are fighters. The only thing we need to do is to solve finishing problems. I believe in my boys and we will still be in the Premiership next season.”
