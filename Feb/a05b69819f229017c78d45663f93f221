EVERYTHING in parliament is ready for President Cyril Ramaphosa to deliver the State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday, 10 February. National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and National Council of Provinces chairman Amos Masondo held a media briefing on Tuesday, 8 February about parliament’s readiness to host the Sona. Mapisa-Nqakula said it was not easy to plan the Sona after the fire in parliament last month. However, she said after hard work, they were ready to host the president. She said some members of parliament would be physically present, while others will attend virtually. “The eleventh-hour change in the venue has caused a serious setback in the planning and preparations, which ordinarily begin several months in advance,” said Mapisa-Nqakula. The presiding officers said this year’s Sona will be held under the theme: “Following up on our commitments: making your future work better”. They will maintain traditional activities that are done during the address despite using a new venue. Mosimanegape Jeremiah Jason, an imbongi from Manthe Village in North West, is expected to usher Ramaphosa into the chamber with a Tswana poem. “We can confidently say we are ready to host this important event. “With crisis comes opportunities and we hope this event will go down in history as another proud moment for our nation, notwithstanding the circumstances under which it is being held,” said Mapisa-Nqakula Invited guests who have confirmed their attendance include former president Thabo Mbeki, former deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and former speakers of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete, Max Sisulu and Dr Frene Ginwala. Sona will now be held at the Cape Town City Hall.
