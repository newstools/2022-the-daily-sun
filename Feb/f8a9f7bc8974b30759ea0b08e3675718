SABC 3’S popular show Celebrated Love is back with another season. According to the producers, the new season of the show will feature some of South Africa’s most high-profile couples such as Tumi Morake and her husband Mpho Osei-Tutu. They met at the University of Witwatersrand and have since worked together behind the scenes on several productions. The show will also feature veteran actor Jerry Mofokeng wa Makhetha and his wife Claudine, who have been married for so long that they finish each other’s sentences. The couples, whose lives are always in the spotlight, will be celebrating their incredible journeys in life, love, and marriage, as they navigate the challenges that come with their high profiles and public scrutiny. “Through the narration of the couples, Celebrated Love explores relationships that survive and even thrive through the highs and lows of long-term commitment and tells the love stories of the five couples whose marriages have stood the test of time, proving that love can still flourish in contemporary times,” the statement by the channel reads. Other couples who will be featured on the show include Ebrahim Rasool and Rosieda Shabodien, Nicky van der Walt and Lee-Ann Liebenberg and Jay Naidoo and Lucie Page. Comedian Tumi took to Instagram to announce the show and said: “Yho I had even forgotten we did this Mpho Osei-Tutu.” Celebrated Love premieres tonight, 2 February, at 9pm on SABC 3.
