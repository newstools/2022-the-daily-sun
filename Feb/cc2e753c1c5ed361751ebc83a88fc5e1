SINGER and songwriter Lady X has decided to take a break from social media. The talented songbird, whose real name is Xolisa Mvula, said she made the decision because she wants to focus more on herself and her mental health. “I am taking a break from social media because I need to process how all of this has triggered me and affecting me, I hope all of you pause and take Riky Rick’s decision to take his life into consideration with how much you are truly present with the people in your life and maybe before posting his picture maybe process what has been happening internally and open your eyes to the people in your life,” she said.

She recently told Drum magazine that in 2019 she walked away from the music industry because she was emotionally exhausted from the unfair treatment. “That was the last straw. I had previously experienced too much emotional abuse from men with power in this industry. I had reached a point when it was too much. I have three degrees, I can be anything I want to be,” she said.
