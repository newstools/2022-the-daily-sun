UNATHI Mabunda (38) said she wrote the book Girls Prepare, Boys Show Up because she wanted to give women advice on living successful, free and effective lives while single. “Nothing is said about women’s ability to lead successful lives on their own while there are many women, raising families successfully on their own,” she said. Unathi told Daily Sun her book also covers the financial burdens that come with marriage. “In the past, a woman knew what was expected of her and so did the man. The golden rule was whoever made the gold makes the rules,” she said. “These days it becomes a challenge when a woman makes more money than her husband but has to submit to her husband, despite her financial position.” She said readers will learn about this and other social norms in the dating game. “Due to the pressure society puts on women to get married to earn respect and dignity, many women have taken to proposing to men,” she said. Her message is for people to live their best lives and not wait for marriage. “Let it find you. If it doesn’t, that is okay,” said Unathi, who released her book in December and sells it for R260.
