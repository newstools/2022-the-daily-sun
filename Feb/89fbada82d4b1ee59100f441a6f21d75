MARUMO Gallants started their Nedbank Cup defence on a high note when they beat ABC Motsepe League outfit Santos FC 2-0 in the last-32 round match at Polokwane’s Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday afternoon. The win is a huge morale booster for Gallants in their fight to move away from the bottom half of DStv Premiership table where they are not entirely safe from relegation. Sede Dion scored a brace, with his first goal coming in the 18th minute via an easy tap in from inside the penalty box, while he grabbed his second after the break to put matters beyond Santos’ reach. Dan Malesela’s lads had a good game toying around with the minnows from the start until the end. In fact, Gallants should have won this clash with a bigger margin, but their players Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo, Joseph Malongoane and Mvelase were the main culprits, playing like they were at training as they took their foot off the pedal. As for the 2001/02 PSL champions, this was a good opportunity for their youngsters to test themselves against players they admire and watch on TV. To show that Santos’ lads were up against the big boys, they didn’t trouble Bahlabane Ba Ntwa goalkeeper Washington Arubi that much as they failed to take a shot on target, especially in the first half. And now it remains to be seen how far Gallants will go in the tournament they won last year under coach Dylan Kerr when they were still called Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. The positive news for Gallants is that they have a good coach in Malesela who also knows how to win the competition that has a purse of R7m to the winners. Mslesela made history in 2019 when he lifted this competition with TS Galaxy while they were still campaigning in the GladAfrica Championship.
