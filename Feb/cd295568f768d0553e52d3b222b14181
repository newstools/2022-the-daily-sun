EIGHT months after the murder of a policeman, his widow has been arrested! The 41-year-old woman was bust at her home in Sekhukhune, Limpopo on Friday, 18 February while a man, believed to be her makhwapheni, was arrested in Mashashane. Warrant Officer Mogokolodi Digama was on his way from home on 27 June last year when he was attacked and killed at a spaza shop in Apel. The killers fled in his car, which was later found burnt in Madibong Village. The widow and her alleged boyfriend are expected to make their first appearance in the Sekhukhune Magistrates Court on Monday, 21 February for murder. Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said a massive manhunt was launched. “The first two suspects, Mpusheng Malata (31) and Nosky Mabitla (31), were bust in June and July last year. “They were denied bail by the Sekhukhune Magistrates Court and are due to appear again on Thursday, 24 February.” Hawks head of the directorate for priority crime investigation in Limpopo Major-General Thobeka Jozi said an attack on a police official was an attack on the state. “We are going to utilise all available resources to make sure those who find pleasure in killing the police are brought to book and dealt with accordingly.”
