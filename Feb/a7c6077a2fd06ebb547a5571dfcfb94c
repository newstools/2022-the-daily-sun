Orlando Pirates co-coach Mandla Ncikazi says his side’s thumping 6-2 victory over Royal Leopards in their Caf Confederation Cup group B clash was important as they head into Soweto Derby week. Pirates trailed 2-0 inside seven minutes but proved the much better side by the end of the game and Ncikazi admits that, had they not won it, it would have been a huge downer heading into Saturday’s clash with bitter rivals Kaizer Chiefs. They must still face Cape Town City at home before that on Wednesday, but the players should be brimming with confidence after what was, in the end, a very good performance. “We have a very heavy schedule ahead of us and this week is difficult,” Ncikazi said. “Playing today, then on Wednesday in a tough match against Cape Town City. Then Kaizer Chiefs on 5 March, then on 9 March in the Nedbank Cup [away at Marumo Gallants]. “I am happy we got this result because it allows us to look forward at other matches. “It was the worst start I have ever faced in football. I thought they [Leopards] were the more passionate in the beginning and we took things too easy. We warned our team against that and then we had to fight back. “But what was pleasing was once we had equalised, we had that attitude to keep going forward. I am happy that we scored [six] because I think this group will be decided on the number of goals (goal difference)” Ncikazi says he gave the players a rollicking at the break, despite the fact they were leading 3-2 at that stage. He admits such a poor start against Chiefs at the weekend could well see them go on to lose. “We had to kick some chairs and raise some desks because I thought the mentality that the team brought in the first half was not what we expected. We warned them about that, you cannot start matches like that, it is unlike us,” he said. “Sometimes you don’t have the opportunity to come back like we did today, so a positive start is important. We need to start on the front foot, and we did not do that.” -SuperSport
