KAIZER Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter remains optimistic that the club will win their case against the PSL and still play their two December matches filled with controversy. The club is due to appear before the PSL DC on 25 February, after their initial appearance was postponed last week to allow the arbitration processes to be completed. “The whole global football has been suffering,” said Baxter during the Nedbank Cup launch this week. Chiefs were slowly grasping momentum towards the end of last year before being hit by more than 50 positive Covid-19 results, resulting in their no-show in DStv Premiership matches against Cape Town City and away against Golden Arrows. On 3 December, the club applied to the league to have their four fixtures of the month postponed due to an outbreak of the deadly virus at the Village, which the club said required them to shut down their headquarters for all to isolate. However, the PSL rejected the application and then referred to the executive committee, which also turned it down. Chiefs appealed against that decision with Safa’s arbitrator. PSL prosecutor Advocate Zola “Java Lava” Majavu has ordered Chiefs to appear before a disciplinary committee over the two matches they failed to honour at home. “What I would say is that many leagues have been learning this,” said Baxter, presumably referring to the virus.
