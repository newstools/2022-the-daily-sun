A VIRAL video of pupils in a clinic, crying while holding their stomachs, is being investigated. A total of 85 pupils from Mvuzane Primary School in KwaMaphumulo, northern KZN, were taken for medical treatment after experiencing stomach pain on Tuesday, 1 February. It was suspected that they ate lollipops they bought at the school gate. The nine-second video shows pupils crying, with some wearing green uniform and others normal clothes. They’re all holding their stomachs and crying. Another video was later circulated, in which a woman can be heard warning people that she has one of the lollipops that made the kids sick. She warns people not to buy them for their kids. ALSO READ: COPS ARRESTED FOR FRAUD!
