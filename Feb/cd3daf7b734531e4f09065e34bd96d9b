AL Ahly were knocked out of the Fifa Club World Cup by Brazilian side Palmeiras in their semi-final clash on Tuesday evening. Pitso Mosimane's charges were beaten 2-0 and finished the match with ten players on the field after center back Ayman Ashraf was sent off in the last 10 minutes of the match. The Red Devils, who were without some of their key players due to injuries while some were in the Africa Cup of Nations, gave a good credit of themselves in the competition. Palmeiras scored took the lead just before the end of the first half, which saw them going to the break on a driving seat. The Brazilian side doubled their lead four minutes after the break through Dudu. The Egyptian side was making their second consecutive appearance at the tournament. Despite being 2-0 down, they showed character as they did not sit back; they pushed Palmeiras looking for an equaliser. Eventually, their efforts paid off when they pulled one back through Mohamed Sherif, but his effort was ruled offside. Palmeiras will now play the winner of the other semi-final between Premier League giants Chelsea or Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia, while Ahly contests the bronze medal match between the loser of the other semi-final. "Al-Ahly played well and we tried to consolidate during the second half through substitutions, but things did not help us," Mosimane said after the game. "The game was very difficult, especially in the last thirty minutes. We tried to come back in the score despite conceding two goals, but we were unlucky.” “We played a good game and we tried to add more attacking power in the second half.” “The team’s performance was affected by Ayman Ashraf being sent off. It happened in a crucial time of the game, as we were trying to ‏score and equalize the result.” Depite the defeat Mosimane remains on a mission to get the bronze medal for the continent. He said: "We should try and get a medal for the continent. We have to try more and come again next year and do better."
