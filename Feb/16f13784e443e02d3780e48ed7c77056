WHATSAPP is a cross-platform centralised instant messaging and voice over internet protocol service that many of us in Mzansi are using. It is also ranked six in the most downloaded apps in Mzansi. WhatsApp launched an array of features in 2021, and there are more expected to follow this year. The new features are expected to enhance the messaging experience and introduce some new use cases for the app. All of these features are part of WhatsApp beta, which is a test version of the app. You will have to wait for these features to finally make their way to the general release version of the app. The updates shared are from WABetaInfo, a website dedicated to uncovering new features in WhatsApp beta. Some of these features may change or could even be scrapped before making it to the live version of the app. Here are the new WhatsApp updates: 1. Hide Your “Last Seen” From Specific Contacts This feature is for when you want to hide your last seen status from specific people in your contacts but not all of them. Once the feature goes live, you will be able to hide your “last seen” status from only specific contacts and be able to see the “last seen” status of all the other people in your contacts. 2. No Time Limit For Deleting Sent Messages WhatsApp allows users to delete sent messages but there’s a time limit of up to 4 096 seconds (68 minutes and 16 seconds) to delete a message after it was sent. According to testing on the beta version of the app, the company might be planning to remove this limit as a time limit for executing the delete action was not found during the testing. 3. Message Reaction You might react to messages the same way you do on Instagram and Facebook. The preview of the feature was allegedly spotted by WABetaInfo. The feature will reportedly be dubbed as a message reaction and will allow users to react to a message using a total of six emojis. 4. A New Community Feature WhatsApp is working on a new community feature that is reportedly similar to Discord groups and channels. This is not the same as the groups feature that already exists on WhatsApp. The new communities feature would give admins more control over the different aspects of the app. Admins will be able to create multiple groups inside a community, just like you can do in Discord. 5. WhatsApp Logout WhatsApp logout will replace the “Delete Account” button and support the upcoming multi-device feature.
