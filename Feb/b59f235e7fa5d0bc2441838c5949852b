ON MONDAY, 21 February, the De Aar Regional Court in the Northern Cape sentenced a 35-year-old man to life imprisonment for raping his niece. According to Captain Olebogeng Tawana, in October 2017 the accused raped his 13-year-old niece. Tawana said on the day of the incident the victim was in the care of her uncle, while her mother was at work. “Subsequent to raping the victim, he threatened her not to tell anyone about the rape incident, threatening to kill her,” Tawana said. “On 26 January 2018, the victim reported the rape incident to her mother. Medical examinations confirmed that the victim was pregnant and the rapist immediately arrested.” He said DNA tests were conducted and the results positively linked the uncle to the victim’s pregnancy. Following a series of court appearances, the De Aar Regional Court found the uncle guilty on charges of rape on 26 November 2021. “The De Aar Regional Court sent a strong message by convicting the uncle and incarcerating him for life. The hefty jail term should serve as a deterrent to criminals who continue abusing women and children,” Tawana added.
