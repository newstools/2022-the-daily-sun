Dear MizzB MY girlfriend is pregnant and I recently found out that she is cheating on me. I don’t believe the baby she’s carrying is mine. I dislike this baby already. Will it be a good thing to leave her until the baby is born and we do DNA tests? Dear Brada It’s understandable that you are doubtful about the paternity of the baby. As frustrating as it may be, it’s vital to keep in mind that making decisions when you are hurt is not a good thing. The baby is innocent and doesn’t need to be punished because of the mum’s sins. You have the right to choose to leave or stay in the relationship, as long as it brings you peace. DNA tests once the baby is born will help clear the confusion.
