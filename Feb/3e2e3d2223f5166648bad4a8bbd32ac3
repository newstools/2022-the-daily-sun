ZULU King Misuzulu is a member of Shembe Church in Ebuhleni, led by inkosi Mduduzi “Unyazilwezulu” Shembe. Misuzulu normally attends the church services at Ebuhleni church on Saturdays, but on Saturday, 19 February he attended the service at Ekuthuthukeni temple in Westonaria, Gauteng. He was accompanied by his brothers, Prince Bambindlovu and Prince Simangaye.  His spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu told Daily Sun the king has been a loyal church member even before he was appointed king. “He joined Shembe Church many years ago when he was still a prince. “He attended the service in Gauteng because he received the invite from his church to attend. It was the normal church and he attended it as he normally does,” he said. The prince said Misuzulu also joined the church for their holy mountain church service last month. Ebuhleni spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe said Unyazilwezulu Shembe has been in Gauteng for three weeks to worship with local congregants. “We were joined by Misuzulu for the Sabbath church service as he normally did for a long time. It was a normal church to bring the Sabbath closer to those who live in Gauteng because they normally go to Ebuhleni in Durban, KZN. “Inkosi is following his spiritual calling. If it says he must go to the Gauteng temple, then he will go there and worship,” he said. Unyazilwezulu visited Misuzulu at KwaKhangelamankengane Royal Palace in Nongoma in November with thousands of congregants to have the Sabbath and umgidi.
