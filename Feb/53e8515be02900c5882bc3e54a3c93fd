KAIZER Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has admitted disappointment after they were knocked out in the last-32 of the Nedbank Cup on Saturday. Chiefs were sunned 1-0 by TS Galaxy. Augustine Kwem scored the only goal of the match in the 54th minute to end Chiefs dreams of winning a silverware this season. The defeat means Amakhosi’s trophy draught, which dates back to May 2015, will go on to the seventh year as the  DStv Premiership title which is the only competition remaining for them is far from their reach. “Well to sum the game up in one point, I think we didn’t play with the quality that we have,” Baxter told members of the media after the match. “During training this week it was first class and I was certain that we would give a better performance than that. “But when you play cup football you’ve got to build momentum, you’ve got to take the initiative, you’ve got the opponent on the back foot and we made far too many technical errors to build that momentum. Baxter continued explaining: “After the first team 10 minutes I thought we played with a little bit of structure but then I’m sure that after the first 10 minutes Galaxy felt they were in the game. “Because the more mistakes we made, because the more they got hold of the ball, the more they got into our last third, the more they felt they could get something. At no point did we play with that consistency that you need and that’s very, very disappointing.” This was for the second season in a row Chiefs suffering a first-round exit in the Ke Yona Cup. Last season they were knocked out by Richards Bay FC who defeated them 2-1 at the same FNB Stadium.
