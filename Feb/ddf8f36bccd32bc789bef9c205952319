MADALA Joseph Vilakazi (63) looks at the huge cliff the floodwaters have left in front of his house, and wonders if his RDP might be washed away by the river. Joseph from Zakheni Village near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun the sound of the flooding river on Friday was so scary he had to escape his house. “The water came in through the door. I had to quickly leave and go to neighbours. The house is no longer safe and can collapse into the river at any time. The cliff is right at the doorstep and the yard has become very small.” Pastor Piet Motha of the local St John church said the rain had left him heartbroken. “Two buildings at the church collapsed and were swept away by the raging river. When I came to check on Saturday morning, I found them gone. There was a lot of water in the yard. Two others are hanging on the cliff. I have no choice but to destroy them as they pose a danger.” He said if the stormwater drainage was good enough, this would not have happened. Thembisile Hani Municipality spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane-Mokako said officials from the disaster management team were busy visiting affected areas. She said they would compile a report on the damage, and urged people to stop erecting structures near the river.
