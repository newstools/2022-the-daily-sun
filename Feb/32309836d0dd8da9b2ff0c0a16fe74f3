A 39-year-old mayor of one of the local municipalities in the Vhembe District, Limpopo, has been arrested. He allegedly assaulted and injured Carris Munzhelele (25) using a beer bottle at a local tavern in Muswodi Village outside Musina around 3am on Saturday, 26 February. Details of what led to the fight are not known but Carris apparently had to run for his life to his parents’ house to hide from the mayor and a group of men, who allegedly chased after him after the brawl. Carris’ mother Renadni Mavhundavhe (48) said she took her son to the police station to ask for transportation to the hospital after he arrived home. “The police then accompanied us home because it was still dark,” she said. She said when the mayor arrived at the house in his car they thought he was there to ask for forgiveness. “That man showed no remorse,” she said. “He started swearing at me, pointing his finger and spitting on me right in front of the police.” She said she is disappointed that someone of his standing is still at the taverns at 3am in the morning fighting with a young man. “He has a group he buys booze for and when he starts fighting they help him,” Renadni said. She said she doesn’t know how they are going to live with the mayor as they stay in the same village. She said she will be going to local magistrates court to obtain a protection order against the mayor. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo has confirmed that the Muswodi police have arrested a 39-year-old man for assault with grievous bodily harm. Mojapelo said the suspect will appear in the Mutale Magistrates Court today, Monday 28 February.
