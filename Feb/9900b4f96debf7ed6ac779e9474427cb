Dear MizzB MY boyfriend has three kids while I have one. He’s not comfortable that I have a good co-parenting relationship with my baby daddy, but he speaks to all the mothers of his kids whenever he wants. How do I make him realise that I can’t compromise my son’s happiness because of him? ) Sistas Dear Sistas A relationship is built on trust, respect, honesty and courtesy. Be clear about where you stand when it comes to communicating with baby daddy, and let your boyfriend know that you will always put your son’s needs first.
