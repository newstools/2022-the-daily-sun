ABONGILE Mahashe was last seen by his family on Saturday, 12 February. His father Ntsikelelo (58) from Khayelitsha in Cape Town said he last saw the 26-year-old at about 8pm when he went out. “I woke up on Sunday morning and noticed that he didn’t come back home. “I went to church hoping he would be back when I came back, but surprisingly he was not home,” said Ntsikelelo. He said he became worried and started searching for him on Monday, 14 February, but didn’t find him. Ntsikelelo then heard that an unidentified body was found in an open space next to Homba Primary School. “I went to Tygerberg Hospital to check the unidentified body and sadly it was my son’s. “I was told his penis and hands were tied and had a weave on his head,” he said. Abongile was doing his third year in teaching at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. “He was working as a teacher’s assistant at Ntwasahlobo Primary School and we were happy he will finish his diploma soon,” he said. Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said Lingelethu police are investigating a murder case.
