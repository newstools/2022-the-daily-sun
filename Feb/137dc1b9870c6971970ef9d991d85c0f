AT LEAST, 18 senior posts at Gauteng Health Department have been vacant, some for over 10 years. These include head of department, which has not been filled for over a year, and since 2020, chief financial officer. This was revealed by the Gauteng health MEC, Nomathemba Mokgethi, at the Provincial Legislature in reply to the DA’s Jack Bloom. Bloom said it was of great concern that key posts have had acting personnel for so long, as competent leadership was desperately needed to fix the department plagued by scandal and inefficiency. “According to Mokgethi, the post of senior human resource manager in the directorate of health information management and technology has not been filled for 11 years and nine months,” said Bloom. “Mokgethi claims most of these posts will be filled by April or May, but false promises have been made before about filling posts. “I suspect many posts have acting personnel to allow opportunities for corruption. It’s high time that all senior posts were filled in with ethical and competent people who will ensure a decent health service for sick people in our province,” he said. Other posts that have not been filled in include: • Senior administration manager in the directorate for strategic support and performance management, vacant for over 10 years. • Senior administration manager in the integrated employee wellness programme, unfilled for over nine years. • Senior human resources manager at the directorate management, leadership and skills development for over three years. • Senior nursing manager for over two years. • Senior manager in health and occupational risk management for two years and four months. • Senior finance manager for two years.
