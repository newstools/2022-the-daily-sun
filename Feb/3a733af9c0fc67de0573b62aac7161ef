“DRUGS are a menace that is destroying our kasis every day and everyone needs to play a role in the fight against them.” This is the passionate plea by popular Eastern Cape chef Phumla Gobela. She may be riding the crest of a wave in the hospitality industry with her scrumptious meals that are a hit with her clients in Butterworth in the Eastern Cape, but she has been hiding a dark secret. Chef Mbuks, as she is affectionately known, has opened up about her drug addiction. But unlike many addicts who end up with bleak futures or dead, she considers herself lucky to have won the battle before it was too late. In a heartfelt Facebook post on Sunday, 30 January, Chef Mbuks spoke openly about her addiction to crystal meth, also known as tik. She wrote: “One thing I can tell you about tik is that it damages your brain, loss of memory and you don’t sleep. People who abuse this drug have anger issues and they don’t want to be told of its dangers. I experienced it when I was still an addict. It used to make me so paranoid.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Chef Mbuks said she was glad she eventually managed to quit tik, adding that it was hard for addicts to free themselves from the demon. ‘’When you are hooked, you see things differently than those who keep telling you about its disadvantages,” she said.

Soon after getting clean in 2011 she said she started her Mbuks Catering Service with her child support grant money, which was R350 back then. Chef Mbuks said her dream now is to own a restaurant and have five mobile kitchens around Eastern Cape where she’ll create job opportunities for the youth.
