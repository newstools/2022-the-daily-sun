AN ESKOM worker was bust on Thursday, 10 February for allegedly stealing transformer oil and power safety solvent gel. On Tuesday, 15 February, the power utility said the worker was caught by security personnel while trying to exit Eskom’s premises in Rosherville, Joburg. It said the worker was found with three full drums of transformer oil, an empty one, as well as six containers of five-litre power safety solvent gel, for which he had no full removal permit. “The police were called and the suspect was taken into custody. The suspect appeared in court on Monday, 14 February on a charge of theft,” the utility said in a statement. It said it will also subject the worker to internal disciplinary processes. Reacting to the arrest, Eskom Gauteng manager Kith Maitisa said they were disappointed one of their own was implicated in alleged theft. “Eskom remains committed to resource optimisation where we ensure all material is channelled to its intended use. We will continue to heighten efforts to curb material loss and any criminal acts by anyone, including our employees,” Maitisa said. “We continue to urge all those who may be aware of any form of criminal acts by Eskom employees or anyone else to anonymously alert us by calling the Eskom Crime Line on 0800 112 722,” he said.
