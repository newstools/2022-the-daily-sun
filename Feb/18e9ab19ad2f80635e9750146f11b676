NINE provincial women’s Sasol League winners are set to battle it out for promotion to the 2022 Hollywoodbets Super League. The 2021 Sasol League National Championships play-offs kick-off this weekend in Durban. The Championships were postponed in December last year due to the Covid-19 Omicron variant which stopped a number of sporting events from taking place across the country. On Tuesday the SA Football Association announced on their website that the highly anticipated play-offs will now be played at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban from 7-13 February. The tournament will see the top two teams getting promoted into the 2022 Super League. Safa’s chief medical officer, Dr Thulani Ngwenya said no spectators will be permitted to attend the tournament to avoid the spread of Covid-19. “As a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, the Sasol National Championships will be hosted behind closed doors. As per our laid down regulations, no spectators will be allowed to attend the Sasol League playoffs tournament,” he was quoted by the website. Although there won’t be fans at the Championships football fans will be able to watch the semifinals and final on SABC Sport on 11 and 13 February.
