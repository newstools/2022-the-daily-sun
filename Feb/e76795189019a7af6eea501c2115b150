AMAZULU are starting to show signs of maturity in the Caf Champions League group stages, having beaten ES Setif 1-0 in their Group B match at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday, but coach Benni McCarthy is still not satisfied with their finishing. McCarthy was unhappy that Augustine Mulenga seems to have left his scoring boots at home – having missed a clear goal scoring chance in the opening minute. But Luvuyo Memela scored his second group stage goal three minutes before half-time to earn Usuthu their win. The win saw Usuthu stay second in the group with six points, three behind Raja Casablanca who beat Horoya AC by the same score also on Friday. While McCarthy wasn’t happy with the missed chances, he said no one in Mzansi would have given them a chance to have six points from three matches in the group stages. “Yes, everyone might be celebrating and people are saying you must be happy when you can get a victory, but in the fashion that we did it we put ourselves on the back foot toward the end,” said McCarthy. “But having said all that, I have six points in three matches in the group. Would any of you have thought AmaZulu would have six points? But we do, so I’m proud of the boys.” McCarthy also said that seeing Sundowns competing well in the competition motivates his boys. Sundowns defeated Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly 1-0 in a Group A match at Cairo International Stadium on Saturday night, to record their first ever win and goal in Egypt against the 10 times champions. The Tshwane giants have previously lost five visits to Al Ahly without scoring a goal. “We want to empower our league, we want our league to grow,” said McCarthy. “We want our teams to see that if Sundowns can do it on a regular basis, why can’t we? Kaizer Chiefs did it last season (losing to Ahly in the final), that’s what is motivating and inspires me to do well. If Chiefs can do it, why can’t we? That must be motivation enough to push you.”
