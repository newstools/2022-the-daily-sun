MARGARET Letsoalo said burying her brother in 2019 left her poor. The 60-year-old from Mamelodi East, Tshwane, said Matthews Matsho (38) was killed at Heatherly dumpsite but she couldn’t claim from the Road Accident Fund (RAF) until she got a copy of an inquest docket from the cops. Matthews died after falling off a truck dumping rubbish. “It took almost a month for me to hear about my brother’s death. We eventually heard from friends collecting recycling material with him,” she said. Margaret said her brother had been a drug addict since 2014. He started collecting waste to fund his habit. She said the family spent R17 990 to bury him in Mokopane, Limpopo. “I had no choice but to stop renovations on my house to bury him. I need compensation so I can continue. “I have gone through all the required processes, but the police are failing to help me. They have been sending me from pillar to post. Without a copy of the docket, I can’t claim from RAF.” Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said Margaret should speak to the station commander at the cop shop.
