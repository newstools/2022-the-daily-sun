VASCO da Gama and City Lads Ladies have been promoted to the  Hollywoodbets Super League. This comes after the two teams reached the Sasol League National Champs final in the games that are currently underway in Durban. City Lads Ladies from the Eastern Cape booked their spot in the final after beating the hosts Lindelani Ladies 3-2 in the first semi-final. In the second semi-final clash, Vasco da Gama (Western Cape) defeated Croesus Ladies (Gauteng) 4-3 on penalties after playing to a 1-1 draw in regular time. The two sides will now face each other in the 2021 Sasol League National Championship final at King Zwelithini Stadium on Sunday (3pm). The winner will claim R200 000 while the runners'-up will get a consolation price of R100 000. City Lads Ladies becomes the second team from the Eastern Cape to play in the Hollywoodbets Super League. The Hollywoodbets Super League will now have 16 teams, and for the first time since it was established two seasons ago, Hollywoodbets will now have promotion and relegation at the end of the season. Two teams that finish at the bottom of the log will be relegated to Sasol League, while two that reach the national championship finals will gain automatic promotion.
