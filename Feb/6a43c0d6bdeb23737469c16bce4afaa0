HE always shows up to the family’s house between 3am and 4am. But the man doesn’t want to rob the family. All he wants is to poke – and he doesn’t even mind getting it through the window. The family from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, is now tired of being tormented by the man, who has been asking for a poke from them since August. A family member (54) told Daily Sun when the problem started, they heard the man scream saying he’s thirsty for a window poke and anyone in the family can give it to him. She said at first, they thought it was a mad man until he screamed: “Vulani ndibatyiwe” (open, I want sex). The woman lives with her two daughters aged 18 and 24 and two grandchildren aged five and eight. “We’re confused about why he chose our house and why he is asking for sex from us as if we owe it to him. Some people think he maybe raped the wrong person who cursed him,” she said. The woman’s 24-year-old daughter said the man is not a ghost. “The person is normal. That guy makes sure we hear him when he says he wants sex.” She said on one of the days he asked for a poke through the window, they told him to come to the door, but he ran away. She said they hadn’t reported the matter to cops yet. A resident said: “I hope they come up with a plan to catch him and he explains why he chose to ask for sex from them.” Harare police’s Captain Siyabulela Vukubi said the family should contact 082 522 3239 when the man comes back.
