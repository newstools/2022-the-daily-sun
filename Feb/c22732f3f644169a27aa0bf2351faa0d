MOONCHILD Sanelly is preparing to set up an OnlyFans account – but she is not a porn star! Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “What inspired me to start an OnlyFans is the content I share. My team is constantly getting warnings because I’m very risque and that’s my personality.” OnlyFans is an Internet content subscription service based in London, UK, where creators earn money from users who subscribe to their content – the “fans”. It allows content creators to receive funding directly from fans on a monthly basis as well as one-time tips and pay-per-view feature. The Thunda Thighs singer and reality TV personality said she would be sharing content on the adult subscription platform. “There are videos I don’t post on social media so my label and I decided to start this. My fans have also been asking for it, so we have finally done it.” She said she would upload her first post next week. “I will not say what kind of content I’ll be posting because then people will know what to expect.” Moonchild said she was not afraid of being judged. “I’m loved by Beyonce, Gorillaz and Diplo as I am, and judgment is something that happens in SA with regards to me anyway. “Why would I care now? Judgment comes from a lack of understanding. The platform is not necessarily about being nude.” She emphasised that she would not be posting naked photos. “I am not a porn star and won’t be naked. You will never find content of me naked on the streets. I don’t even sell nudes, so people should not expect any of that.”
