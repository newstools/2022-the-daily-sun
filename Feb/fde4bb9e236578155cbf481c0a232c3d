THIS week has not been a good one for cash-in-transit robbers in South Africa and Botswana. This follows another deadly shoot-out which claimed the lives of nine men at phase two location in Gaborone, Botswana on Wednesday, 23 February after an exchange of fire with police. The men, aged between 20 and 35, are from Botswana and South African, according to the statement released by Botswana Police Service. This deadly shooting happened just two days after the South African National CIT Task Team shot and killed eight suspects who were planning a cash-in-transit heist. One of the arrested men who appeared at the Joburg Magistrates Court on Wednesday is believed to be Botswana. However, it is not clear whether the robberies in the two neighbouring countries are linked. According to the Botswana Police Service, 11 armed men attacked and robbed Security Systems cash-in-transit van of over P986 000 (just over R1.29 million) at the Main Mall on Wednesday morning. In a statement, Botswana Police said: “The robbers fled the scene and were later on followed and confronted by the police and an exchange of fire ensued resulting in fatal injuries to some of the robbers. The police have in the process arrested a 30-year-old Motswana woman who was in the company of the robbers.” Botswana Police said they have recovered several guns, four pistols and an AK47 assault rifle, which features prominently in such robberies. They have also recovered an undisclosed amount of cash from the suspects.
