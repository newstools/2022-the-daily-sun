THE National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has come out to support Mineral Resources and Energy minister Gwede Mantashe that Mzansi cannot afford to abandon coal mining. The union said the country had an abundance of coal reserves, and it would be irresponsible and reckless to stop the use of coal. NUM president Joseph Montisetse said Mzansi had developed and underdeveloped cities or villages. “The coal industry has played a vital role in developing most Western countries. With this in mind, South Africa cannot afford to close those coal mines. One cannot just wake up and conclude that you are doing away with the mines. That cannot be correct and God was never stupid in giving us such precious resources.” He slammed those who criticised Mantashe for defending and saving the future of coal mines from extinction. “The minister is now being called names such as a ‘coal fundamentalist’ by imperialists. Mantashe was a mineworker and he understands the industry well,” said Montisetse. Delivering the opening remarks ahead of discussions with South African coal producers at the Council for Geoscience in Tshwane on Tuesday, 1 February, Mantashe said coal miners must “take the bull by the horns” and take part in determining the industry’s role in the energy transition away from fossil fuels. The union said it was not opposed to renewable energy. “We are not going to allow a situation where several communities are left in poverty. We have started a process of mobilising communities to resist and oppose the move of getting rid of coal mines. Why do you have to appease capitalists?” asked Montisetse.
