FUMING Ekurhuleni residents want to know what the municipality is doing about long grass in the area that hasn’t been cut in a while. The grass, they said, is growing wild after heavy rainfall and was in parks, cemeteries, and open spaces bordering residential areas. Phindile Nkambule said she visited her beloved relatives in Rondebult Cemetery but she had to go home as she felt unsafe. In Springs, shoppers walking to Bakerton Square said it’s dangerous to walk next to the road because it’s easy for thugs to hide in the grass. Residents from nearby houses in Bakerton are also complaining about their safety. “We aren’t feeling safe,” said resident Sorisa Khan.  Zweli Dlamini, spokesman for the Ekurhuleni city manager, apologised for the backlog. “It’s the rainy season and the grass grows faster. We’ve appointed a service provider to start soon.” Dlamini said procurement processes also delayed and the matters take a long time. “We’re aware of the grass in the Rondebult Cemetery and other cemeteries in Ekurhuleni.”
