FORMER Comrades Marathon winners - Gift Kelehe and Ann Ashworth - blasted the Ultimate Human Race organisers for decreasing the winners' prize monies. This year's 90km down-run from Pietermaritzburg to Durban, set for 28 August, was launched in Joburg on Thursday. However, the decision to decrease the prize money from R525 000 to R260 000 upset many and was described as "rip-off" by elite runners. To make matters worse, they (organisers) have apparently increased entry fees to R1 200 for local runners, R2 000 for Africans, and R4 500 for international runners, according what SunSport gathered.In 2019, entries were R600, but seem to have doubled in two years. Entries open on 23 March, and the race will cater for 15 000 runners this year. Comrades Marathon Race Director @JamesRowyn announced that entries will open at 10am on Wednesday 23 March 2022 and will close on Thursday 31 March 2022.Get more details on our Facebook page. #Comrades2022 #TheReturn #Sishay'ibuya pic.twitter.com/YRJaogOnxB Kelehe, who won the race in 2015, did not hold back in his criticism of the organisers, calling them a "disgrace". He said the prize money should be a million rands and "not peanuts". If Kelehe wins the race, he will be taxed 25% and pay his coach 10% of his winning out of the R260 000, according to him. Comrades Marathon Association chairman Mqondisi Ngcobo told SunSport they set aside R38 million to stage the marathon. Ngcobo said the board decided to decrease the prize money and increase entries to balance the books. They lost several sponsors and did not make income in the past two years due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. They retrenched their staff members to ease their financial burden. “We are balancing the books, and we had to revise the prize money because we have not collected entries in two years," said Ngcobo. "We are under huge financial pressure. It’s either we give do a race with decreased prize money or abandon it." Kelehe said they should not have bothered to launch the race, knowing they did not have money. “It’s a shame," said Kelehe. "They came here confidently to launch the race, but reduced the prize money, and they had two years to look for sponsors but failed. What they did is unacceptable, and entries go up, but the prize money decreases,” added a furious Kelehe. Ashworth, who won the race in 2018, will run in the colours of Hollywoodbets, but doubts if it would attract international runners. “My biggest concern is that the prize money is not enough to attract good international runners, and there is no appearance fee. I assisted disadvantaged runners with entries, but R1 200 is too much, and I was taxed 25% and paid my coach a commission of 15% in 2018, and I will be left with little if I win this year,” said Ashworth. #Comrades2022 The Return, Sishay'ibuya. ????‍??#Theultimatehumanrace pic.twitter.com/77sqVyLvfN
