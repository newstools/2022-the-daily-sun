A FARMER from KwaZulu-Natal gets upset whenever he sees black people singing “Dubulibhunu” and toy-toying. John Prinsloo (73) told the Equality Court sitting in the South Gauteng High Court on Monday, 14 February that this reminds him of the attack that happened in his home in November 2008. “What upsets me is that these people eat and live off the food that is produced by the farmers in this country and they can jump and jive from the energy of that food, yet they can jump and shout (Dubulibhunu).” Prinsloo was called by AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets to testify in his complaint against the singing of the song, which translates to “Kill the Boer”. Roets wants the court to declare it hate speech and order EFF and its leader, and parliamentarian Mbuyiseni Ndlozi to apologise and pay damages. ALSO READ: JUJU: CYRIL IS THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER! The EFF claims it has changed the lyrics to “Kiss the Boer”. Prinsloo said three young men broke into his house and shot him and his wife. “My wife just collapsed forward and I thought she had just fainted. Then I felt I could not move,” he said. He said the attackers demanded money. “I was taken to hospital where I was told the bullet injured my spine and I would never be able to walk again. That was when I got the news that my wife was actually dead,” said sobbing Prinsloo. However, under cross-examination, Prinsloo conceded he did not know if his attackers were influenced by the song. He said he couldn’t say the attack was racially motivated either. EFF lawyer Msondezo Ka-Siboto said: “There’s no evidence, given what you have told us today that suggests the assailants were specifically motivated by the singing of the song ‘Kiss the boer’, is there?” “No, my Lord. I supposed there isn’t,” said Prinsloo.
