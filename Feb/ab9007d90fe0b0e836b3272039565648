FORMER president Jacob Zuma has suffered another legal setback. On Wednesday, 16 February, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed his appeal to the ruling that Prosecutor Bully Downer did not have to recuse himself from his arms deal corruption case. Judge Piet Koen said he saw no chance of success if the matter was heard by the Supreme Court of Appeal and the trial should continue in April. Speaking outside court, Advocate Mthunzi Mhaga of the NPA said: “We were expecting the judgment to be in our favour, given the fact that the Supreme Court of Appeal has ventilated these issues. It has pronounced on issues they rehashed while presenting their case.” However, a clearly disappointed Carl Niehaus, one of Zuma’s biggest supporters, said the ruling would disadvantag the former president. “We cannot accept this because the consequences of this are that president Zuma is even more disadvantaged than he has been in the past,” he said. Jacob Zuma Foundation spokesman Mzwanele Manyi said they were used to Zuma losing. “All we are here for is a fair trial and the state is not interested in a fair trial. The court even dismissed further evidence, so that when a decision was made, all the facts were not on the table,” he claimed. Meanwhile, the usual crowd of Zuma supporters was replaced by a very small group that was seen lighting what they called a light of hope.
