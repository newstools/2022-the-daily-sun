THE Mpumalanga Division of the High Court in Mbombela on Wednesday, 2 February, heard how murder-accused Julius Mndawe dug trenches in all his victims’ shallow graves. Mndawe is standing trial for the murders of Tokkie Tlaka (24), Banele Khoza (15), Noxolo Mdluli (17), Nomthandazo Mdluli (19) and Felicia Shabangu (19). The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to the murders as well as for defeating the ends of justice. The investigating officer, Sergeant Joseph Mnisi, took the stand and detailed how the graves were set up. He told the court Tlaka’s remains were found buried inside the yard of the accused, in the garden next to a pit toilet. Banele and Noxolo’s remains were also found buried in the same garden. Nomthandazo and Felicia’s remains were found buried under the floor in an unfinished structure attached to the accused’s house. He said in the shallow grave where Tlaka was found, he noticed a brown burnt blanket and the shallow grave was wet. State prosecutor Zwelethu Mata said this showed the murders of the five women were premeditated. The case was postponed to Friday, 4 February, for judgment.
