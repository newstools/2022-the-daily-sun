KEKULO Dikobo was born in 1972, which means she’s 50, but Home Affairs claims she’s 10 years older! The upset woman from Refilwe, Tshwane, told Daily Sun her ID said she was born in 1962, which was causing her pain. She said she was tired of being made fun of by people her own age and the problem had left her scared to even celebrate her birthday. “I want to tell the world I’m not a gogo but a younger person who still needs to work for her family. I feel Home Affairs has robbed me of my life and career. I am still working but my ID says I’m 60, which means I have to go on retirement while I am still young,” she said. Kekulo said she tried to fix the problem at the Lebowakgomo and Cullinan Home Affairs offices but officials did not help her. Home Affairs spokesman Siya Qoza said: “The department needs to retrieve records linked to her application as part of resolving the matter. “The department will be in touch with her as it finalises the matter.”
