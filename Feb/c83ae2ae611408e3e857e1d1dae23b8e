HER uncle was murdered in December, allegedly over the family house. Two relatives were arrested, while others are on the run. But a knife believed to have been used in the murder was left behind. The remaining family members now live in fear after a sangoma told them the knife would end them all unless something is done about it. Smangele Dladla (30) from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, said the house belonged to her gogo Dinah Mgidi and grandfather Armando Mathonsi. “They lived alone when they were still alive and invited me to live with them. I lived with them until they passed away in 2020,” she said. Smangele said the problem started after her grandparents died. “I moved into the RDP and invited my uncle to live in the backroom shack. Some relatives were not happy. They wanted the house for themselves and I stayed because my grandparents told me to stay,” she said. She said her uncle Lawrence Mathonsi (53) was killed, allegedly by four relatives in December. Smangele said she had to move out of the house as she did not feel safe. “We were warned we would be next if the knife is left behind. “A sangoma said even though they might not use the same knife, we are not safe,” she said. Smangele said those who were arrested are still inside. Sangoma Khethiwe Hlongwane said the knife could cause a problem and their sangoma needs to perform rituals to remove the curse. She said they should hand over the knife to the police afterwards to form part of the investigation. But cops said the family never informed them about the knife. Etwatwa Police Station spokeswoman Sergeant Khensani Mathebula said the police would investigate if the knife was used in the murder.
