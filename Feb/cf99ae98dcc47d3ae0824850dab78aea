KAIZER Chiefs have already started to plan for next season in a bid to end their trophy drought, which stretches to seven years. Director of Sport, Kaizer Motaung junior, said he inherited seven years of strategies that are not working. The Soweto giants bowed out of the Nedbank Cup in the first round. Motaung described the early elimination in the Ke Yona Cup competition as a disaster. “It has been a terrible sore point that we exited the Nedbank Cup in the first round, and it was a massive blow for us. It is something that we cannot accept and we don’t accept. The plan for next season has long begun, we have a five-year plan,” said Motaung. Motaung is looking at the player movement and focussing on the contract negotiations. He plans to reduce the average age to make room for young players. Motaung wants the club to play more youngsters as part of the turnaround strategy. “It is in our mission and vision, and we cannot deviate from that. We must have the right mix of youth and experience to balance the squad. We will buy quality players and get the right level of experience. I am more focused on reducing the average (age) at the moment. I inherited a squad with contracts that are ending and have to map a way forward to get the club where it needs to be,” said Motaung. “It is about being true and honest about the process and introducing the plans that will bring change.  There is a whole new direction that we have to take. We have long and short-term plans that will excite our fans. It required hard work,” said Motaung. Motaung (40) is working closely with the head of development Molefi Ntseki, and head coach, Stuart Baxter, and he meets them daily to discuss the turnaround strategy. “There are massive plans, and we discuss a lot to player philosophy and win in a certain way. We  are at that level where things intensified. We have a pre-training meeting with the coach and the technical staff, post-match and prepare for the game,” added Motaung.
