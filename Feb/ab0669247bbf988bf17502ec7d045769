ORLANDO Pirates Diski Challenge coach Mandla Qhogi has urged his youngsters to remain grounded as they enter the second round of the season, which he believes will be tough. Pirates lead the Diski log with 36 points from the first 15 matches of the campaign. This weekend, the Diski Challenge will start the second round of the season, and Qhogi said they are fully aware that all the teams will be gunning for their heads. “In fact, even before the season started, we knew that all the teams will be gunning for us,” Qhogi said. “But so far I am impressed with how we have done. However, I feel we could have done better in the three matches we lost.” Pirates visit Royal AM on Sunday at Mpumalanga Stadium (10am). Qhogi admitted it would be a tricky clash for them, but they will fight tooth and nail to emerge victorious. He said: “Royal AM are a free-scoring team. We have seen that in most of their games. They will want to disturb us, but the good thing is that they also concede (goals). “Our job will be to tighten our defence and convert each chance we get. “I told my players that we have not won the league or anything. The race is still on and they should not focus on the log standing, because that will mislead them. They need to remain focused, grounded and take each game as it comes.” Pirates have opened six point gap between themselves and second placed Stellenbosch FC. In the first round of 15 matches, Pirates won 13 and lost three. Qhogi said he was impressed with their run in the first round, but looking at improving again. Royal AM have not been consistent. They are 10th with 20 points from the same number of games.
