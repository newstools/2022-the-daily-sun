WITH one year to go before the Netball World Cup, the local organising committee is excited about their preparations. Netball SA president Cecilia Molokwane and the World Cup local organising committee team will make a special announcement in Sandton on Friday. There will be exhibition matches and festivities to celebrate the countdown to the World Championships in Cape Town next year. Molokwane said the Proteas are targeting a top three finish at the Championships, taking place on the African continent for the first time. The Proteas are fifth in the world rankings, and the first lady in SA netball believes that they can secure that top three finish on home soil. She believes in coach Dorette Badenhorst and her assistant coach, Dumisani Chauke, to take the team to a podium finish. “We are where we are supposed to be, and I am happy with the progress that we have made,” said Molokwane. “(On Friday) you will see how we have moved and how ready we are about the World Cup this week.” The Proteas will also compete in the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in England in July, where they will play their first game against the highest-ranked country in the world, Australia, on 27 July. She praised captain fantastic Bongiwe Msomi, who will lead the team in the World Cup, and described her as a role model for the sport. Msomi is the face of the World Cup, and her humbling story motivates everyone to dream big. “We are humbled and blessed with her as a leader, who leads by example and is down to earth. We have an amazing captain in our country. She is a breath of fresh air in our sport. ‘She is a role model and a true leader,” added Molokwane.
