THOUSANDS of people gathered outside Parliament to demand that Minister of Finance Enoch Godongwana stop budget cuts. “Voetsek with budget cuts!” was the most common among the speakers from different organisations that took turns making their demands as the budget speech was presented. EFF members, including spokesman Vuyani Pambo, mama Makoti Khawula and Noluvuyo Tafeni, gathered outside Parliament in the morning. The fighters said they were demonstrating against the loans which the country keeps racking up from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) also took to the streets and gathered outside Parliament. Samwu secretary Bridget Nkomana said: “Our message is clear. The fat cats sitting in this Parliament today are going to make us poorer and poorer. We are here to say voetsek to these budget cuts. “In the health sector there are budget cuts, in education, there are budget cuts. Our children can’t even go to the toilets because it is so dangerous. They will die for going to the toilet,” she said to the cheering crowd. Mooketsi Diba from the Batshabelo Unemployed Movement said cutting the budget means there won’t be an increase in the R350 grant that unemployed people are currently getting. “Voetsek R350! Phambili nge R1 500, phambili. “The R350 we are getting is not enough. We are not lazy but don’t have jobs,” he told the crowd. Treatment Action Campaign’s Makhosazana Mkhatshwa said: “Our message is clear. We need money in the health sector, we need money allocated for the hiring of healthcare workers. “We are going to the clinics at 5am and leave at 4pm because there is a shortage of staff. We have shortages of essential medicines, our health infrastructure is in shambles.”
