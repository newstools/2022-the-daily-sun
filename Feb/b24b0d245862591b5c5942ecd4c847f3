The ANC in the Western Cape has called on the provincial government to fix Khayelitsha District Hospital. The party conducted its oversight visit at the hospital last month when a series of challenges affecting services were identified, including a shortage of beds. ANC health spokeswoman Rachel Windvogel said about R150 million was needed to sort out the problem. “The ANC calls on the premier and provincial government to make available the R150 million needed to improve services at Khayelitsha District Hospital. This amount will, among other things, help to fill the 369 positions needed in the hospital, especially in clinical services, allied health services and support services,” she said. Windvogel said her party was disappointed by the absence of the health MEC and the head of department at a meeting held on Wednesday, 23 February. “This exposes yet again the disregard and nonchalant attitude of the provincial government towards the challenges at the hospital. Today it became clear that this government does not care about the people of Khayelitsha and the persistent challenges at Khayelitsha District Hospital,” she said. Windvogel said there was an urgent need to address staffing and bed shortages. “While the official bed capacity is 340, the hospital often operates at 446 beds, which is 106 beds over its capacity. Rapid population growth in Khayelitsha over the past 10 years means that the hospital is servicing a number that is way more than the number it was originally built for,” said Windvogel.
