BANYANA Banyana have started preparing for what could be a historic year for the women’s national team! Banyana, led by coach Desiree Ellis, could find themselves qualifying for their second Fifa Women’s World Cup. Banyana, who made their World Cup debut in France 2019, are currently in camp preparing for a friendly match against Zambia at the 5 000 seater Nkoloma Stadium in Lusaka on Saturday. The friendly is in preparation for their crucial two-legged Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (Awcon) qualifier against Algeria. The first leg will be played at Orlando Stadium next Friday with Banyana travelling to the North African country for the second leg on 23 February. Banyana’s main goal is to qualify for the 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. But they need to overcome Algeria to reach the Awcon finals in Morocco from 2-23 July. At the Awcon, they must secure a top-four finish as countries that finish in the top four will qualify for the 2023 Women’s World Cup. Midfielder Thalea Smidt is looking to bring the Caf Women’s Champions League experience she gained with her club Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies to Banyana and contribute to achieving their main goal. “It was a great season (referring to club level where they won three trophies including the Champions League) for us as we achieved unprecedented success as a unit,” said Smidt. “I am excited to be part of the national team and I plan to excel in my craft by working very hard in training and delivering when called upon.” Ellis said: “For us it is not just about this game but the qualifier, that is the most important game. But we have got to make sure that we get everything right in this game. “We know when the overseas-based players arrive the level goes up.”
