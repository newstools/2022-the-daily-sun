MARITZBURG United boss, Farook Kadodia, has warned his players not to get carried away to ensure they achieve their target to avoid relegation. Kadodia is not yet relieved, despite his side easing their relegation worries with a 2-1 win over SuperSport United in a DStv Premiership at the Harry Gwala Stadium last week. The win ended The Team of Choice’s 11-match winless run in all competitions. Maritzburg, who face Golden Arrows in a league game at the same venue on Friday, are four points ahead of bottom club Baroka FC on 18 points from 19 matches. So far, they won four, drawn six and lost nine in the league. Said Kadodia: “We still have a long journey ahead. Therefore, we need to stay grounded and work hard to retain our PSL status. We should continue grinding out results. We can’t afford to lose focus at this stage of the season.” Kadodia hailed his new players for adding the much-needed stability to the team. The club signed Tawanda Macheke, Genino Palace, Lucky Baloyi, Steven Pereira and Friday Samu. Zambian-born striker Samu played a crucial role in their win over Matsatsantsa when he scored and also assisted Rowan Human to find the back of net. “We signed five players who can do the job. They’ll add value to the team. I’m happy they managed to adapt to the coach’s system and gelled with the rest of the squad.” Kadodia stressed that he never doubted coach Ernst Middendorp’s philosophy, even when results were not forthcoming. “Our coach has massive experience and it’s important that we give him much-needed support. We know what he can do. “The win will give him and the team relief. We expect more positive results going forward.”
