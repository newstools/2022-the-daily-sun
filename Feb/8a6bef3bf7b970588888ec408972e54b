A GROUP of pupils made the gruesome discovery of a bloodied, lifeless body of a woman near Chayaza High School in Calcutta near Hazyview, Mpumalanga. They were on their way to school when they discovered the body, and alerted the police. “We were rushing to school when we spotted something sinister in the bushes nearby. It was a woman lying in a pool of blood. We notified the police,” said one of the traumatised pupils. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed that a 25-year-old man, believed to have a child with the 20-year-old victim, had since been arrested. “Police were conducting their normal duties when a group of pupils notified them of the discovery. Members went to the scene, where they found the body of a woman. “The clothes the woman was wearing were covered in blood. Medical personnel arrived at the scene, and certified her dead. A murder case was opened as preliminary investigations suggested foul play. A manhunt was launched for the suspect, leading to the father of the two-year-old daughter,” he said. He added that the suspect was arrested, during which police found an item believed to belong to the victim. “Police also found some clothes with blood stains where they arrested the suspect. Investigators also seized an item they are convinced might be the weapon used in the murder,” said Mohlala. Commissioner Lieutenant–General Semakaleng Manamela has condemned the horrific incident. “It is very sad when mothers are brutally murdered, leaving behind their little ones. This is enough and it must come to an end. We hope justice will be served,” she said. The suspect is due to appear in court on Monday, 14 February, in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court facing charges of murder.
