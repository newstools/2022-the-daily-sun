VOLVO Car South Africa has announced the local launch of the much-anticipated XC60 T8 Recharge, as the Swedish luxury automaker continues its shift towards electrification. The all-wheel-drive plug-in hybrid newcomer sits at the top of the recently refreshed XC60 line-up, above the B5 and B6 mild-hybrid variants, and is available in both distinctive R-Design and luxurious Inscription trim levels. The starting price is R1 218 900. The high-performance, low-emissions power-train comprises the company’s 233 kW and 400 Nm turbo and supercharged 2.0-litre petrol engine, a 107 kW and 309 Nm electric motor sited on the rear axle and an 18.8 kWh lithium-ion battery capable of receiving a charge via cable.  The result is the best of both worlds, with the latest version of Volvo’s popular mid-size SUV boasting a pure electric range of up to 81 km, a combined fuel consumption of only 1.6 L/100 km and a 0-100 km/h sprint time of just 4.8 seconds. Volvo’s Geartronic eight-speed automatic transmission is standard. As with other derivatives in the XC60 range, the T8 Recharge features the Volvo’s latest Android-powered infotainment system, complete with built-in Google apps and services. Volvo Car South Africa managing director Greg Maruszewski said the XC60 T8 Recharge arrives at the right time, with local interest in electrified vehicles growing fast.  “Globally, sales of Recharge models increased 11,5% year- on-year in January 2022, accounting for 31,7% of all Volvo vehicles sold around the world during the month,” said Maruszewski. The XC60 has been Volvo’s top-selling SUV globally since 2009, and was awarded the World Car of the Year title in 2018.
