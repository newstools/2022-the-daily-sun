A PREGNANT shop assistant was recently strangled to death by her own hair during a job interview in Borisov, Belarus. Daily Mail reported that the 21-year-old, identified as Umida Nazarova, had applied for a new job at Svarmet factory – that produces welding wire and electrodes – when senior staff members were showing her around. It is reported that during the tour, Umida’s loose hair suddenly got caught in a machine and wrapped around her neck, and she became trapped and was covered in blood. The Belarus investigative committee said an employee who was showing her how the machine operated paused to make a record in a register. “When she turned her head, she saw the woman already lying on the floor, unconscious. Her hair was tangled in the machine,” the committee said. Reacting to the shocking news, Umida’s mum Olga Nazarova said her daughter’s throat was severely injured. “If her scalp had not been torn off, she would have been strangled there and then by her own hair,” she told the publication. It is reported that the plant’s head of production was charged for failure to fulfil her official duties due to a dishonest and negligent attitude.
