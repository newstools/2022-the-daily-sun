ACTOR and music producer Limo Mbhele seeks to help talented, up-and-coming young artists. Limo, who is the younger brother of the comedian and actor Pastor Mjosty, has dedicated his new music recording studio to young, talented artists. His recording studio, called Rockstar Records, is located at Amanzimtoti, south of Durban. Limo, from Amanzimtoti, who appeared in Pastor Mjosty’s Kwaito Church Service comedy movies told SunBuzz he doesn’t want the youth to end up doing drugs because they have nothing to do. “I want to make things easier for the talented youth who want to get into the music industry. “I’m hurt that a lot of the youth with talent don’t get help and then involve themselves in bad things and drug use.
