AN 18-year-old suspect has been arrested for allegedly killing his two family members in Jojweni, Mount Fletcher in the Eastern Cape. Warrant Officer Majola Nkohli said the Mount Fletcher detectives managed to arrest the 18-year-old a few hours after the murder of two family members. The killings happened on 9 February. The victims had stab wounds in their bodies. “It is alleged that just after 2pm on 9 February, cops responded to a complaint of two murders. said Nkohli. The suspect appeared in the Mount Fletcher Magistrates Court on two counts of murder. The National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) Eastern Cape spokesman Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 17 February for the possible bail application. Resident Zuke Mpompo (45) said the killings left everyone in the community shocked. “Our villages are getting popular for the wrong reasons. Our kids are being possessed by an evil spirit and the abuse of alcohol and drugs,” said Zuke. “We are shocked, and we are praying the alleged killer doesn’t get bail. He doesn’t belong in our community, he belongs in jail.” Another resident said drugs were controlling their kids. “The sad truth is that there is nothing we can do about it. Drugs are controlling them, and in return, they control us,” said the resident.
