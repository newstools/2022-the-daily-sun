JEANS are one of the most popular clothing items people love and own. So much so that one fashion blogger has said almost every single person at least owns one pair. According to Thread Curve magazine, there are over 20 different types of jeans that all suit different body shapes and styles. And, recent fashion trends have seen a great change in the conventional designing of jeans. From the inclusion of patches to the popular torn-up style, jeans have become wilder in design. Speaking of wild, some jeans have coloured outside of the lines of normality. According to https://brightside.me, some jeans not only take fashion to the next level, but will also make you take note, including: 1. Jeans with clear knee patches A post shared by Shivani Gupta (@shivani_gupta89)  What if it rains? Now my knees are protected, right? These jeans are also great for those who love kneeling and crawling. 2. Bare-butt jeans A post shared by VETEMENTS (@vetements_official)  Have you gained some weight? No problem. Just unzip your jeans. Warning, these jeans are only for the bold! 3. Clear plastic jeans A post shared by VOGUE HONEYMOON (@voguehoneymoon)  Much like the bare-butt jeans, these are only for the brave. They’re also good for rainy days. 4. Meat knee jeans A post shared by Slightly Smudged (@slightlysmudged)  If you want to raise the steaks or start a fashion beef, then these jeans will cause a stare.
