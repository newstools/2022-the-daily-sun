Sisulu University student Sibongile Mani has been found guilty of theft in
connection with R14 million accidentally credited into her account by the
National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) in 2017. East
London Regional Court Magistrate Twanette Olivier on Monday found Mani guilty
of stealing R818 000 of the funds. Olivier
dismissed her defense that she never had the intention of depriving NSFAS of
the money and that she had no knowledge of committing a crime. Sentencing
is set for 8 March 2022. SOURCE:
