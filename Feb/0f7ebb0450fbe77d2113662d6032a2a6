PROPHET James Hlanze has become the talk of his kasi. Before he prays for a patient, he puts a lit match inside his mouth. Speaking to Daily Sun, the 54-year-old from Mfuleni, Cape Town, said: “When I light a match, it removes darkness from my vision and allows me to have a clear vision of the problems my patient is encountering. “When I tell people about their problems, they actually get shocked because I can tell them what has happened, what is happening and what will happen.” James said when he prayed for someone without a match, everything became like a dark room. Resident Nomzuzu Kasa (35) said she went to the same church as James and he was good at what he did. “I joined the church because of him. I saw him helping lots of people, especially those who were unemployed. “I have been struggling to get a job since I was retrenched. I have attended three interviews in two weeks. This has never happened to me before.” Another resident said a family of a missing girl visited James for help in January. “Two days later, they came and told him the child was back at home,” said the resident. James said he started helping people in 1984 and his powers came from God and his ancestors. He said before he started his journey, he was taken underwater for three days and met his ancestors. They gave him an iron rod and a mirror to help people. James said he only charged a fee to solve problems with muthi in people’s homes. “In some of these homes, you could die trying to fix it,” he said.
