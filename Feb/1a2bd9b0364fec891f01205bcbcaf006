THE Manungas are devastated after their kids died. Thandie (3) and her brother Yamkela (9 months) died in a fire at their home in Gugulethu, Cape Town, in the early hours of Sunday, 6 February. Family member Boniswa Manunga said the kids’ mum ran out of the burning shack, leaving her kids inside. “Their mum woke up and realised her shack was on fire. She ran out to look for help and left the kids. Sadly, she couldn’t get back inside because the flames were too strong,” she said. Boniswa said no one was blaming the mum because people did not think straight when a fire broke out. “We cannot ask why she left them inside because that will not bring her kids back. “She is in pain and we cannot make things worse for her. I’ve never seen such an orange fire in my life. We poured water over it but it didn’t help. It looked like we were pouring paraffin.” Boniswa said when they threw sand on the fire, it got stronger. “It’s clear the fire was sent to kill her along with her kids,” she said. The kids’ mum Unathi (27) said her breasts were painful because she was supposed to be breastfeeding her baby. She said she ran out to look for help. “I am still in pain and I don’t want to talk about this too much. It feels like a bad dream that my kids are gone,” she said. Sergeant Wesley Twigg said Gugulethu cops opened an inquest docket. He said the cause of the fire had not been determined yet. Anyone with information can contact 08600 10111.
