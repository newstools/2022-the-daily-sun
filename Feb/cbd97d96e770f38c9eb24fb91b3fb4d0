CHIEF justice hopeful and current Supreme Court of Appeal president, Justice Mandisa Maya has appealed to be regarded as a good judge and not just a woman candidate vying for the top judiciary job. Maya, who took the hot seat in the second day of interviews for the vacant chief justice position, took issue with a question of whether the country was ready for a female chief justice, saying this question angered many women in the judiciary. Maya said the country has been ready since the new dawn of democracy as it had capable women who could occupy that position then. “I don’t think it’s a proper question to ask because it implies all sorts of negative things,” she said. “But the short answer is that South Africa has always been ready for a woman chief justice. “Why are we asking about black women as if we are this homogenous, special group that needs to be done a favour?” Maya broke down when the issue of gender was brought up again later in the interview and revealed that she shared “utter” disappointment that of the two women justices who were recommended to the Constitutional Court, men were appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa instead. If appointed, Maya will become South Africa’s first woman chief justice. She was nominated by women groups of judges locally and internationally. She boasts a wealth of judicial experience after serving in different capacities until she was appointed as president of the Supreme Court of Appeal in 2015. She quashed suggestions that she was an outsider because she was not serving in the Constitutional Court, saying most of justices in the apex court had worked under her at some stage, and she has their support.
