GENDER selection has received a lot of criticism around the world but there are people who would rather not let genetics pick the sex of their baby. Gender selection is a treatment that allows parents to choose the sex of their unborn kids. It is a screening which allows IVF embryos to be tested for gender-related genetic conditions before being placed in the womb. There is a lot of controversy surrounding the procedure with most people thinking that it is ethically wrong to have to choose the gender of your baby. “Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should,” Dr Robert Gustofson, medical director of the Colorado Centre for Reproductive Medicine, told Parents.com. Gender selection is not allowed in Mzansi and is illegal, according to the National Health Act, unless there’s a medical reason.According to Parent24, one of the most accurate methods of gender selection is pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which works similarly to IVF. It allows couples the chance to screen embryos before they’re implanted. PROCEDURE: Firstly, medication is given to promote multiple eggs to develop. Then a woman’s eggs are retrieved and fertilised in the laboratory with her partner’s sperm. A single cell is removed from each of the fertilised eggs and sent for genetic analysis to determine if the eggs are healthy, and if they’re an X or Y. The egg chosen (boy or girl) can be transferred into the woman’s uterus, guaranteeing the gender of the baby. Gender selection was banned in Mzansi in 2012 following concerns about what happens to the embryos that aren’t selected for transfer. PGD creates viable embryos (fertilised eggs). Couples can choose to freeze good quality embryos for future use, but many opt to destroy them. The main countries with clinics that offer the methods include the US, Thailand, Cyprus, Mexico and Italy.
