SOMEONE allegedly wants gogo’s house so they can extend their tavern. And strange things have since been happening in gogo Selina Malebo’s house. Now gogo Selina lives in fear. The 68-year-old from Duduza in Ekurhuleni, who lives alone, said one morning she found soil behind the door, which looked like it was poured by someone. “I went to a sangoma who told me the soil was apparently taken from a grave. I can’t sleep at night. There are things moving around on the roof. My neighbour sometimes swears at me and says I will leave my house,” she said. Gogo Selina believes someone is taking advantage of her as she’s old and lives alone. “My son disappeared and I don’t know where he is. He was a focused child, but he changed suddenly. I’ve been to sangomas who said someone is trying to destroy my family. But he didn’t say who that person is. “I’ve been quiet for too long and I now want people to know what I’m going through,” said the gogo. Gogo Selina said she has, for now, moved out of her house. “I don’t enjoy living in that house because of this thing. I don’t know what I did to that person because I don’t ask her for anything,” she said. Daily Sun contacted the the person, who denied the allegations. “I’m the one looking after her. How can I do bad things to her? She’s not telling the truth,” said the person. The gogo said the the person was just trying to act clean. “She knows what she’s up to,” said gogo Selina. Sangoma Khethiwe Hlongwane said it was possible for people to mix soil from graves with muthi to achieve their goals.
