TALENTED actress Lerato Mvelase recently took to social media to reminisce about her first days of acting 28 years ago. The former Isibaya actress remembered how excited she was to be paid to do what she loved, and the joys of working with amazing creatives. “In 1995, I set foot in a professional theatre as an actress. The lights, set, actors, script and white people – I had never met them so closely until then, as well as real-life professional directors,” she wrote. “I was galvanised into a space that made me realise that black child it is possible. I got paid with a brown envelope every Friday. I got paid to do what I love. I knew then that God lived in me,” she continued. ALSO READ : LALELA TO REPRESENT SA AT MISS SUPRANATIONAL!
