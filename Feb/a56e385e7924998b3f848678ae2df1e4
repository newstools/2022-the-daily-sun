THE South Gauteng High Court in Joburg sentenced Lucky Mshubi (36) and Thabo Mambila (31) to life in prison for the murder of a 31-year-old woman. On 22 April 2021, the victim’s flat was broken into at Lenasia South by two suspects who kidnapped and took off with her vehicle. Police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said a careful investigation conducted by Sergeant Phillip Mofokeng of the Gauteng Provincial Anti-Gang Unit led to the discovery of the stolen car and the arrest of Mshubi, who was found in possession of the victim’s belongings. “Further investigations led to the arrest of the second suspect, Thabo Mambila, and the discovery of the body of the victim which was buried in a shallow grave in Mshubi’s yard,” Sello said. On Friday, 18 February the court found both Mshubi and Mambila guilty on five charges and sentenced them to life imprisonment for murder. Mshubi and Mambila were also sentenced to 17 years and 15 years’ imprisonment, respectively, for robbery and three years’ imprisonment for kidnapping. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela commended the investigating team that worked with dedication in ensuring the perpetrators were arrested and faced the full might of the law.
