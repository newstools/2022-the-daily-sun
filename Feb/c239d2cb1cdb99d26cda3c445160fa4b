ORLANDO Pirates fans will be looking to their Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs to take maximum points from Stellenbosch when they clash at the FNB Stadium on Saturday  (10am) to keep their Diski Challenge title quest on course. There is always a tremendous rivalry between the Soweto giants, but the reserve Bucs side are hoping their Amakhosi counterparts will do them a favour and ease the pressure at the top of the table after Pirates blew a seven point lead. After 18 matches this season, Pirates are still at the top of the log with 40 points, Stellenbosch are breathing down their neck with 39 points in second spot. But Chiefs coach Vela Khumalo said it is not about favours. Khumalo said: “If we win the game, we will not be doing anyone a favour but ourselves. I am looking forward to an interesting game. “We know Stellenbosch are a scoring team and we can also score.” While Chiefs host Stellies, Pirates will also be home to get the job done against Cape Town City FC at the Rand Stadium at noon tomorrow. Bucs coach Mandla Qhogi remains optimistic things will turn around. “A win for Chiefs would be a lovely result against Stellenbosch,” said Qhogi. “No favours. The games are coming thick and fast. The payers must be strong mentally and have the character in the upcoming games to remain at the top until the end of the season.” Two weeks ago, Pirates and City drew 0-0 at the Bidvest Wits Stadium. Qhogi said they know what needs to be done. Diski Challenge leading goal-scorer, Boitumelo Radiopane, is expected to continue his scoring spree for the young Bucs squad. So far, Radiopane has scored 17 times in 18 outings. DISKI CHALLENGE FIXTURES SATURDAY SUNDAY
