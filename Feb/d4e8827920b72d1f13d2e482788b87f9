IN THIS week’s episode of Digital Bones, sangoma Nzama Maluleke explains why it’s important to strengthen your car. He said when something good happens to you, not everyone will be happy. Nzama said some people might even take steps to harm you because of their jealousy. “They can bewitch you to make sure you don’t have the car for long. They can use muthi to cause car accidents,” he said. Nzama said if the car was strengthened, no evil shall prosper against it. “They will try everything but they won’t succeed,” he said. Nzama said if you didn’t strengthen your car, you might end up regretting it. He said strengthening a car didn’t need an inyanga or a sangoma. “People can strengthen their cars in different ways. Prayer also strengthens it. What is dangerous is to buy a car and drive it as if it’s always been there. You must tell your ancestors that you’ve bought a car and they should protect it.” He said izangoma could install a traditional tracker on their clients vehicles. “When someone steals it, they bring it back kneeling,” said Nzama.
