Thami Mkhize has extended his contract with Cape Town City for another two-years, which is set to lapse at the end of 2023-24 season, according to the club. Mkhize, who is one of the longest-serving players for the Mother City club, opted to stay on with John Comitis' side after featuring in 15 league matches this season. The KwaZulu-Natal defender joined City just after the 2016-17 season had started, after his move with Orlando Pirates hit a snag. Mkhize was said to have signed with Pirates at the beginning of that season after leaving Maritzburg United, but he did not train with the club, revealing then that he was signed without the knowledge of then Bucs coach Muhsin Ertugral. However, Ertugral, as Pirates coach then, deemed Mkhize not fit for his profile. However, Mkhize's move to City was a masterstroke in his career. In a few months he joined the club, Mkhize played a pivotal role as City claimed the Telkom Knockout trophy in 2016 under current coach Eric Tinkler when the club was just 144 days old after Comitis had bought the status of Mpumalanga Black Aces. The 33-year-old then added the MTN8 trophy to the then Benni McCarthy coached side in the 2018-19 season. He came close to adding another Wafa Wafa trophy this season, but missed a vital penalty as City lost to Mamelodi Sundowns in the long drawn shootouts at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban in October last year. Internationally, Mkhize made his Bafana debut under coach Stuart Baxter against Burkina Faso in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in October 2017 at FNB Stadium. As he kept on producing the goods for his club, Mkhize played all five Bafana matches in the Afcon 2019 finals in Egypt when Mzansi lost to Nigeria in the quarter finals. ?? | Cape Town City is delighted to announce the renewal of City captain Thami Mkhize.
