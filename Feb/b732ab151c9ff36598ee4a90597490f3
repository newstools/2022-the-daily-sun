REALITY TV personality Zodwa Wabantu has set tongues wagging once again. The media personality, who recently said that she was undergoing initiation to be a sangoma, shared snippets of her journey. But she received mixed reactions from her fans. It is unclear what the ritual was for, but she was pictured with white paint all over her body, and someone carrying a chicken while another person was stirring something in a bucket. Some milk and biscuits were also in the background. Zodwa captioned the photo: “Camagu”. Shortly after that, her fans expressed confusion over what was going on, with many others questioning if they were allowed to see what she had posted and that nowadays, nothing was sacred anymore.

They make you lose your mind in different ways. So they were taking me out of poverty and gave me this kind of life. They know that’s not the end of me; it’s not my purpose that I have to fulfil,” she said. She also revealed that she had not yet been initiated, and pleaded with her ancestors not to deprive her of sex. “I told them I want a lot of money. I want to be happy. I told them with men, I don’t want to be deprived and be a bitter old woman or sangoma if I’m going to be one. I don’t want to be angry that I can’t have sex. If they don’t like or want him, then they must send another one. They should never refuse for me to be with someone. I love sex,” she said. A post shared by zodwalibram (@zodwalibram)
