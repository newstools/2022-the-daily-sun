TAKING the form of the imaginary men’s conference, The Rakgadi Foundation headed by Semali Moeti, will host The Real Men’s Imbizo. Semali (55) is the sister of the late tombstone guru Lebogang Khitsane. She trended on social media in 2020 after she lashed out at her brother’s widow and accused her of bringing a man into his house. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said many men would benefit from the imbizo. “They’ll unlearn and learn new things as well as have a dialogue around issues that most men shy away from talking about, especially their health,” she said. According to Semali, men usually find themselves misinformed and it is time they start ensuring they are informed as far as their financial, physical and mental state is concerned.

Encouraging self-awareness and facilitating dialogue can create meaningful change among our men and reduce current doctrines and stigmas that limit changed behaviour and societal progress.” Speaking about her foundation, Semali said she started it because she wanted to help change the negative connotation and narrative associated with a rakgadi. “The role of a rakgadi in many families is either eroded or not well understood, thus resulting in the misconstrued understanding and I want to change that misconception,” said Semali from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. She said the aim of the foundation was to help empower youngsters. The imbizo is set to take place on Saturday, 12 February at the Killarney Country Club in Joburg. Tickets are available from Quicket for R350.
