The 41-year-old wife of a murdered Limpopo police officer has been arrested together with a man believed to be her boyfriend. Police have identified the two as prime suspects in the murder of Warrant Officer Mogokolodi Cleopas Digama, who was stationed at the Apel police station. The two were arrested on Friday. According to Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke, the wife was arrested at her home in the Nebo, Sekhukhune. "Her accomplice, who is reported to be her boyfriend, was arrested by the same team at Ga- Mashashane. Preliminary investigations revealed that the deceased’s wife has a child with her accomplice," Maluleke added. Digama was attacked and killed by heavily armed men at a spaza shop in Apel on 27 June last year while he was on his way home. The gunmen drove off in his vehicle which was later found burnt out in Madibong village near Sekhukhune. Maluleke said the matter was immediately referred to the Hawks, and a massive hunt for the killers was launched. The first two suspects, Mpusheng Titos Malata and Nosky Mabitla were arrested in June and July 2021 respectively. "Malata and Mabitla were denied bail by the Sekhukhune Magistrate's court and will appear again on 24 February 2022," Maluleke said. Digama’s wife and her boyfriend are expected to make their first appearance in the Sekhukhune Magistrate's Court on Monday 21 February to face murder charges. Provincial Hawks head Major General Thobeka Jozi, has praised the team on the latest arrests. "An attack on a police official is an attack to the State. We are going to utilise all the available resources to make sure that those who find pleasure in killing the police are brought to book and dealt with accordingly," Jozi said.
