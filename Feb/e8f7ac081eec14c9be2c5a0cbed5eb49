ACTRESS Tebogo Thobejane’s YouTube podcast, City Girls, is flourishing. The first episode took Mzansi by storm back in 2021, and the podcast recently reached 227 000 views. However, it has been no stranger to controversy. An episode in November caused drama between the former Muvhango actress and her influencer friend, Inno Morolong. After it was uploaded, Inno demanded that it be taken down because she felt Tebogo was body-shaming her. The two fought publicly on Instagram. The most recent episode, that premiered on Tuesday, 8 February, featured an interview with Zodwa Mkandla, the ex-wife of controversial socialite Genius “Ginimbi Kadungure.
