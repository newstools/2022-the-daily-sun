SHE was at her boyfriend’s place on Tuesday, 8 February, when another woman arrived to visit him. The side chick then asked her what she was doing at her boyfriend’s place. The woman, who has been with her man for five years, told the side chick the shack belonged to her and her boyfriend and that the clothes in the cupboard were hers. But the side chick attacked the 35-year-old from Khayelitsha in Cape Town and they exchanged blows. The woman fell and the side chick hit her with a bottle on the head. The woman said she was out for a few minutes after she was hit with the bottle.

The woman said when she asked her boyfriend about the side chick, he said she was someone he met at the tavern and flirted with.  She then ended things with him as his explanation didn’t make sense. “I would rather be alone than be a fool. I’m still deciding whether I want to open a case,” she said. The People’s Paper couldn’t get comment from the side chick as the boyfriend didn’t have her contact details and he didn’t know where she lived. A neighbour said: “I feel for the woman because her boyfriend is a player. This is not the first time this has happened in his house and it will continue because he doesn’t respect women.”
