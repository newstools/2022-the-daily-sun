AMAZULU could lose their budding star Siphesihle Maduna to top Egyptian club Pyramids who are monitoring the midfielder’s progress SunSport has learnt that the top Egyptian club are said to be working with Pitso Mosimane’s agent and wife, Moira Tlhagale, to see the deal completed. Maduna is one of the exciting youngsters in the PSL, having made his breakthrough with Usuthu in the 2019-20 season. He was also one of their stars last season helping Usuthu finish as runners up in the DStv Premiership. As an attacking player, he plays a similar style to that of Mamelodi Sundowns young midfielder Siphelele Mkhulise. However, this season he has seen little action due to an injury. He has featured in 12 matches in all competitions, scoring once. His last appearance for Usuthu was a 2-2 draw against Chippa United on 14 December. But that hasn’t stopped Pyramids in expressing an interest in the Durban-born player. Since Mosimane joined Al Ahly as head coach in October 2020 and has brought huge success to the Ahly, Egyptian clubs now have a different perspective about Mzansi players. They are looking to sign SA players as Mosimane continues to defy the odds with his success with Ahly. SunSport has learnt that Mosimane and his wife were engaged when Pyramids showed an interest in Cape Town City attacking midfielder Fagrie Lakay. Mosimane’s wife then played a role to help facilitate the move along with Lakay’s agent Paul Mitchell. City asked for big money for Lakay, thinking Pyramids will be put off but that wasn’t the case as they agreed terms and signed Lakay in the January transfer window. They are looking at doing the same with Maduna, who is out of contract with AmaZulu at the end of 2022-23 season. Pyramids are the club that also signed Gift Links previously before City then coached by McCarthy brought him back to Mzansi from Egypt in July 2018.
