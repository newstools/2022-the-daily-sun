COPS are investigating the murder of two women on the night of Sunday, 13 February. Captain Frederick van Wyk said they were shot at 10.45pm in Bloekombos in Kraaifontein, Cape Town. The victims were Tlalane Ngotshane (45) and sangoma Shingai Mutsamanyi, whose age was not known. Tlalane’s daughter Anelisa (23) said the murder happened after she left home to go buy food. “Just after arriving at the shop, I heard gunshots. Something inside told me they were coming from home,” she said. Anelisa found her mum wounded at the scene. But she died not long after. “She was with the sangoma, who had come to help her with her business,” said Anelisa. She said her mum sold fruit, vegetables, meat and booze.  “We don’t know where the other women came from.” She said the suspects didn’t take anything from her mum. “They were there to kill them. We don’t know if they wanted my mother or the sangoma.” Anelisa said the sangoma was not from Mzansi. She said they found a photo of a man in her bag and were able to locate him. But he said he didn’t know her. “We are confused.” She said her mum was shot in the face, stomach and back, while the sangoma was shot in the neck and back. Van Wyk said anyone with information should call 08600 10111.
