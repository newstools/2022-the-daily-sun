FORMER 3Sum member Amstel Maboa wants the gay community to stop hating on each other. He told Daily Sun he felt it was time to speak up against discrimination within the community. “There is internalised homophobia, transphobia and biphobia. There are fights within the community and these things need to come to a stop,” he said. “There’s a thing called femme bashing. When you’re feminine, they say you’re too much and should change and be masculine. “Even in the trans community, they’re competing on who transitioned better and who looks like a woman. Our community is crumbling and it’s a big issue.” Amstel said these issues were not new but were getting out of hand. “The masculine gays are the ones with the problem. They feel like femme gays are too much and I don’t understand what that means because we’re all gay people and fall under the same umbrella,” he said. ALSO READ : I WAS BORN WITH SONGS TRAPPED IN ME! Transgender model and reality TV star Yaya Mavundla said she’s had a lot of discrimination. “I’ve experienced it within the community and outside. This is a human thing. “I wish parents could teach kids love at a young age. If you love yourself and you’ve been taught to be at peace with what you have and who you are, you will not envy or judge others.” Macmillan Ngobeni of gay rights organisation, Access Chapter 2 said he was aware of the issue. “It’s subtle bullying and most people don’t take it further because they see it as small. Even though it is something big, they fail to report it. They only report physical altercations,” he said.
