RICHARD Mbulu’s late goal helped Baroka FC to hold runaway leaders Mamelodi Sundowns to a 1-1 draw in a thrilling DStv Premiership match at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday night. Mbulu unleashed a volley during the referee's optional time to snatch a vital point for his side. The Sundowns bench were fuming with senior coach Steve Komphela and Wendell Robinson following referee Xola Sitela into the tunnel demanding answers for awarding Baroka a free kick that led to the equaliser. The draw robbed Downs the chance to secure the title in the bag as Mbulu cancelled Lyle Lakay's opener via a great free kick in the 48th minute. Baroka could have won the match as they missed a penalty in the 22nd minute that could have given them a cushion with defender Basel Mphahlele being the main culprit as he ballooned the ball over the bar from the spot. Sundowns are 18 points ahead of second placed Orlando Pirates with 48 points from 21 matches. The Brazilians priority is to put the league title in the bag in order to focus on the Caf Champions League and Nedbank Cup. This was Downs’ fourth match in 11 days having beaten Sudanese side Al Hilal 2-0 in their opening group match of continental competition in Rustenburg over the weekend.  Downs will now travel to Egypt where they will face another Sudan side Al Merreikh in Cairo and they will stay there to prepare for their next group match against Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly next Friday. The Tshwane giants have always enjoyed dominance over Baroka having beaten them seven times in 12 matches dating back to 2016.  Bakgaga came into the match highly motivated having registered a morale boosting 1-0 win over Stellenbosch last Friday to book their place in the Ke Yona Cup. However, Baroka are still not safe from relegation since they are third bottom, tied with Swallows FC on 14 points from 18 matches.
