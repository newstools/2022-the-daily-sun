UKRAINIANS raised national flags and played the country’s anthem on Wednesday, 16 February, to show unity against fears of a Russian invasion that Western powers have claimed could be imminent. Russia has denied it will invade, but has warned it could take unspecified “military-technical” action if its security demands, including restrictions on NATO, are not met. On Kyiv’s main street Khreshchatyk, where flags decorated government offices, it was business as usual for many. “Just a normal day, but these flags are here for a purpose, to show we fear no one. They did not scare us,” said Mykola, who operates a small coffee stand. – REUTERS
