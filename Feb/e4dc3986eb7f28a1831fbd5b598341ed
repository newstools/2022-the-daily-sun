IT’S evident that when you put a lot of hard to win it and persevere, then you’ll get what you want. That is the strategic belief of Senegal coach Aliou Cisse while talking to the BBC Sport after the Lions’ first Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) victory against Egypt in Cameroon on Sunday night. Cisse said perseverance was the key as the Lions of Teranga finally claimed their inaugural African trophy after beating record winners Egypt 4-2 in a dramatic penalty shoot-out in the final played at Olembe Stadium in Cameroon at the weekend. Both teams couldn’t score at regulation 120 minutes time, including a saved fourth minute penalty kick by Liverpool star Sadio Mane. But Mane had the last laugh when his penalty in the shoot-out clinched the title. Mane was seen consoling his Liverpool teammate and captain of Egypt Mohamed Salah after the game. Cisse credited his team for adopting the never say die attitude. “It just shows that if you work hard, if you persevere you will get what you want, “ Cisse told the BBC. “I am very emotional because the people of Senegal have wanted this trophy for 60 years.” Cisse, appointed in March 2015 by the Senegal FA, will be a relieved man now as his job has been under scrutiny with Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane being touted as his successor. But after this triumph, Cisse, who has been in charge of 70 games, will remain in his job whether Senegal qualifies for the Fifa World Cup finals or not. Senegal and Egypt will meet again in the two-legged World Cup play-offs next month, where five countries will qualify for the World Cup finals in Qatar. The first leg will take place on 23 March in Egypt at Cairo International Stadium, the venue where Senegal lost the 2019 Afcon final to Algeria. The second leg will be played at Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in Dakar on 29 March.
