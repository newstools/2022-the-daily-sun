A TAXI driver was stopped by five men and a woman on Friday, 18 February. As usual, he stopped for them but it turned out these were no real passengers. However, he didn’t suspect anything as they paid the fare. Along the way, one passenger told the taxi driver he wanted to get off at the curve. “The driver stopped at the curve side and one male alighted. One male who was seated behind him pointed a firearm at him and ordered him not to move,” said Captain Johannes Ramphora. “The passenger who got out of the vehicle came to the driver’s door and pulled out a firearm. The driver pushed the door against him and he fell down. He managed to get out and run away, leaving the engine still running and he saw the vehicle driving off.” The driver kept running until he came across the police and told them what happened. “The man said he was driving from Devon to Springs in a brand new White Toyota Quantum. Police called the owner of the taxi, who said he was going to call his vehicle tracking company.” They went to Devon Police Station where a case of hijacking was opened for him and the car was circulated. Captain Ramphora said the police are still looking for the Toyota Quantum with registration number HG 87 PC GP.
