AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy was left crushed by the tactics used by Moroccan giants Raja Casablanca following their 1-0 defeat in the Caf Champions League Group B match at Mohamed V Stadium, Casablanca on Saturday. McCarthy blamed Raja players for diving. However, he was also not happy that his players failed to score, saying if they have aspirations of going through to the knockout stages, they have to convert the few chances that come their way against teams from North Africa. Usuthu playing in the group stage of the Champions League for the first time were not overawed by the occasion. With the way AmaZulu went about their business, McCarthy wasn’t too hard on his players but was left severely unhappy about Raja’s tactics of falling down after almost every tackle. “Yes, they kept possession and couldn’t penetrate us in crucial moments,” said McCarthy after the match. “And I think the best chance in the first half fell for us and it was far easier to score than it was to miss. If you get these chances and you don’t take them, you expect (them) to make your life difficult because the opponent is at home, they have everyone behind them, and they eventually got an opportunity to score after we didn’t clear our lines. “Once they got the goal, the antics began. Their players were going down and the referee didn’t take control of the situation,” added McCarthy. “When players are just falling down and screaming and time wasting tactics, of course it disturbs your rhythm.” Usuthu host Horoya of Guinea who lost 1-0 to ES Setif in another match on Saturday, at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday.
