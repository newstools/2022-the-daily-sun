THE SA Football Association (Safa) president, Danny Jordaan, says playing against world champions France in a friendly next month will accelerate the growth of Bafana Bafana’s young squad. Bafana face Les Bleus in a friendly at the Stade Pierre Mauroy in Lille on 29 March. Bafana coach Hugo Broos is rebuilding the squad, having selected younger players since he took over on a five-year deal last May. Broos, who helped Cameroon claim the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) trophy in 2017, is rebuilding the squad to be competitive for the next finals in Ivory Coast in 18 months’ time and also for the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers. The Belgium-born coach omitted many senior players that were used by his predecessor Molefi Ntseki in the failed 2021 Afcon qualifiers, saying it was an ageing squad in desperate need to be refreshed. Jordaan said, for Bafana to grow, Safa must ensure they organise top nations to play against, who will toughen them up to handle tough matches in the future. “These young boys have done well. Remember, they went 11 matches unbeaten and Ghana was a bit of chaos,” said Jordaan, referring to that controversial 1-0 defeat in a vital away World Cup qualifier against the Black Stars. “But it is a young team. Therefore, we must give them the best possible opposition so their maturity and experience can be accelerated and it cannot be a bigger nation than France. So, now we will see how we cope with the world champions in their own backyard.” Broos has been watching domestic matches and will name his squad 14 days before the friendly. Bafana will be meeting France for the fifth time. They lost to France in 1997 (2-1) and in the opening 1998 World Cup match (3-0), before playing to a goalless draw in 2000. Bafana finally got the better of France in the 2010 World Cup winning 2-1 in the last group stage match in Bloemfontein.
