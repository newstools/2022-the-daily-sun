THE thugs had their fake goods confiscated by South African Revenue Services (Sars), so they decided to break into its storage building to claim back what was theirs. Five suspects, wearing Sars uniform, came in driving a car marked with its emblem on Wednesday, 2 February. At the gate, they told the security they had been sent to inspect the building. Once inside, they threatened four guards with guns, disarmed them and took their cellphones before forcing them into a toilet, with one thug watching them. Guards said they heard trucks moving into the yard and goods from the storage building being loaded. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the building is used by Sars to safeguard confiscated goods. “The incident happened during the day, and the five suspects were in a white VW Polo. They were dressed in Sars uniform and their car was also marked,” he said. “The suspects threatened the guards with firearms, took their weapons and took them to an outside toilet. “The others forced open the factory and loaded two big trucks that arrived later. “When they left, it was discovered they had taken liquor and cigarettes.” Ramphora said no one was injured.
