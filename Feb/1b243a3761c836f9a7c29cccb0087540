MADALA Kunene was recognised for his contribution to the arts. The 71-year-old received the African Intellectuals of All Time Lecture Award, R30 000 and a tribute song during an event which was organised by Ukhozi FM current affairs presenter, Bongani Mavuso. The event was hosted by the Bongani Mavuso Foundation at KwaMashu KCap, north of Durban on Saturday, 5 February. Madala, who has been struggling as he has not been able to tour overseas due to Covid-19, said the cash prize would help him a lot. He told the SunTeam he was happy to be recognised in his home town of Durban while he was still alive and could experience it. “I’m happy it was not only an honorary award and it came with money as I’m not travelling overseas to make money,” he said. “As a musician, I’m honoured to have Bongani fight for us and make sure we get the recognition we deserve. I thank him for his good work.” ALSO READ : FIGHT OVER MJOKES’ ASSETS! Bongani told Daily Sun: “We are respecting our arts industry and protecting it.
