KAIZER Chiefs are out of the Nedbank Cup, meaning that the Soweto giants wait for a trophy will continue. With the league title looks like it will elude them again this season, their dry spell will be extended to seven seasons. Amakhosi were beaten 1-0 by TS Galaxy on Saturday night at FNB Stadium. With the league race looking like a one-horse race as Mamelodi Sundowns have opened 17 points between them and the second-placed team, Chiefs will need a miracle to catch up with them and win something for their fans. Chiefs are fourth in the log with 28 points, 19 points behind Sundowns. Chiefs' last won silverware in 2015 when they won the league title. Heading to the Ke Yona last-32 match, they were hoping to go all the way and end the dry spell; however, that was not the case as Galaxy denied them that opportunity. The two teams started the match on a positive note created a couple of chances, but none of them could find the opening goal in the first half. They went to the break tied on 0-0. Amakhosi were punished after nine minutes in the second half when Augustine Kwem broke the deadlock for Sead Ramovic's men with a clinical strike past Peter Petersen after latching onto a costly Phathutshedzo Nange's back pass. Chiefs made substitutes, adding more firepower with strikers Samir NNurkovic and Leonardo Castro making their way, but they could not break Galaxy defence. Castro found the back of the net in the dying minutes with a close-range finish from Lebogang Manyama's knock-down, but the goal was disallowed for offside, as the Rockets held on to secure a spot in the last 16. Galaxy joined Sundowns, Orlando Pirates, SuperSport United, Royal AM, Venda Football Academy, Summerfield Dynamos, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, Sinenkani, Platinum City Rovers, Swallows FC, University of Pretoria, Mathaithai and Baroka FC, who are all through to the last-16 of the tournament. The draw for the last1-6 will be made on Monday evening (6pm).
