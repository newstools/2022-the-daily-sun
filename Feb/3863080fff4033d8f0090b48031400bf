WITH fuel prices expected to reach record highs, public transport commuters will have to dig even deeper into their pockets. Prices have been rocketed due to the war between Ukraine and Russia and making matters worse, Russia is one of the biggest sellers of crude oil to South Africa. National Taxi Alliance spokesman Theo Molele said an increase in the fuel price might force them to consider increasing taxi fares. “The government should speed up subsidising commuters because the taxi industry can no longer afford to charge charity fares with the ever-increasing fuel prices,” he said. He said the industry was asking the government to review fuel levies and to give them an exemption. Samuel Nemusunda, who drivers commuters between Joburg and Meadowlands in Soweto, said: “The petrol price is going to hit us hard.” He said the upcoming petrol hike could even lead to taxis being repossessed. Commuter Buhle Kumalo said: “Should there be a taxi fare increase, this will affect me financially. When you draw up a budget, you set aside a certain portion of money. If there is an increase, you have to take money away from other things to spend on transport.” Sifiso Khumalo, who transports school children, said petrol hikes were giving him chest pains. “I have two taxis I use to transport children. In a week, I spent about R1 400 on one of them,” he said. “With the money parents are paying, I don’t make any profit. It’s a hand to mouth situation because the money just comes and goes. “I have another car for errands, which I also need to fill with petrol.”
