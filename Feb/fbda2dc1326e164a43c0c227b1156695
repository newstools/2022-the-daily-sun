IT’S back to the drawing board for TS Sporting coach Benson Mhlongo after his team’s elimination in the Nedbank Cup first round. The GladAfrica Championship outfit suffered a 2-1 defeat to Swallows at the Dobsonville Stadium at the weekend, but Mhlongo took some positives after a gallant effort from his boys. Sibusiso Fakude scored in the 20th minute to put the visitors in the lead, but Swallows came back in the second half with goals by Yagan Sasman and Ruzaigh Gamildien to grab the victory. Mhlongo will shift his focus to the league and try to help the Mpumalanga-based club survive relegation. He was proud of his players and he believes they gave the DStv Premiership side a run for their money. “I am happy with the boys, and I have no complaints. “We needed strength and speed, and we were indecisive in front of goal. I know what I need to go forward. The pitch was heavy, and we learnt a lot from this game. We learnt a valuable lesson,” said Mhlongo. “I have something to work on and know what to do to fix this. My focus is to help the team score goals, and I need two weeks to get it right. I am encouraged by the performance and have an idea how to stop the rot,” Mhlongo explained. Sporting are 14th in the Championship with 15 points from 17 matches, and need to collect points to avoid relegation. Mhlongo’s charges will host Cape Town Spurs at Kabokweni Stadium in Mpumalanga on 19 February in the league.
