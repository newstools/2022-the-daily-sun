A KZN man is lucky to be alive after spending hours trapped in a car wreckage. It is alleged the man had an accident, which led to his car rolling down an embarkment on Thursday night, 27 January. He was then trapped in the wreckage until Friday morning, 28 January, where he screamed for help hoping that someone would hear him. Luckily enough, a passerby heard him and when he went to investigate, he saw a car and called for help.  According to Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst, they responded to an incident on the M13 in Pinetown, west of Durban, on Friday morning. He said reports indicate the driver of a light motor vehicle lost control sometime during the night, resulting in the vehicle rolling down an embankment.  “A passerby heard calls for help coming from the bush, he then went to investigate and found the patient trapped in the car. When medics arrived on the scene, they found that the patient had sustained moderate injuries,” said Herbst. He said while medics stabilised the patient, a Netcare 911 rescue technician used hydraulic tools to free the man from the wreckage. “Once treated, the patient was transported by ambulance to hospital for further care,” said Herbst.
