A MAN was killed and two other people injured when their vehicle rolled off the R37 in Ga-Maja outside Polokwane, Limpopo, on Thursday, 17 February. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene to find a light motor vehicle at the bottom of a drainage ditch off the side of the road. “A man was found lying trapped in the driver’s seat while a woman and three-year-old boy were lying next to the car. The man had already succumbed to his numerous injuries, and he was declared dead,” Meiring said in a statement. He added that the woman sustained several injuries and was in a critical condition while the boy had moderate injuries. “Medics treated the patients, who were then transported to a nearby hospital,” Meiring said. Circumstances leading to the accident were yet to be established, and local authorities were investigating.
