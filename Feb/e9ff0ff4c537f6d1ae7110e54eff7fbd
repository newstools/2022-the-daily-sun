AN INMATE at the notorious Sun City prison left the nation shocked when he stabbed three prison wardens! Pictures of the wardens went viral on social media with many users suggesting that security must be beefed up. Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said the incident happened on Wednesday, 9 February and all three officials were treated and discharged from hospital on the same day. “Minimum force had to be used in disarming the inmate and stopping him from attacking other officials. “The incident is disturbing and the inmate will be charged criminally for this attack on officials,” he said. Facebook users questioned how inmates were able to sneak deadly weapons into the prison in the first place. Dudu Vuyeka said her cousin, who was a prison warder in Mpumalanga, was also stabbed in 2017. “He was badly injured and my aunt even forced him to leave his job because she feared he was risking his life,” she wrote. Sinokuhle Mantshantsha said there was also an issue with prisoners having phones and going live on social media platforms. “This is the reason inmates are even able to poke prison warders in these facilities. Security is not tight at all and this gives them the chance to do as they please,” he wrote. Lindelani Mhlongo said it was important to remember that prisons had dangerous criminals in them. “Don’t forget that prisons have murderers, so of course security needs to be tight,” he wrote. Lindiwe Masemula said she was tired of reading about wardens being assaulted by inmates. “There should be more ways to prevent this from happening,” she said.
