HOROYA coach Lamine N’Diaye says he has an idea what to expect when they play AmaZulu in their Caf Champions League Group B clash at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday night (9pm). That is because N’Diaye has watched his side play against top Mzansi’s clubs Mamelodi Sundowns, Bidvest Wits, SuperSport United, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs in either the Champions League of Confederation Cup. Both Usuthu and Horoya lost their opening Group B matches. AmaZulu were beaten 1-0 by Raja Casablanca in Morocco while Horoya were beaten by the same margin by Tunisia’s ES Setif. This means neither side cannot afford to lose as that will dent their hopes of reaching the knockout stages. “We know that AmaZulu is not a small team,” said the Senegalese-born coach N’Diaye. “But in football, sometimes you win games and sometimes you lose. So with AmaZulu, we are going to make sure that we are coming here to collect the three points.” N’Diaye won the Champions League with TP Mazembe in 2010. He took the DR Congo side to the Fifa Club World Cup final in 2010, the only African team to reach the final, only to lose to Samuel Eto'o’s Inter Milan.
