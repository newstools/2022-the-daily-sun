THEY had planned another hit on a cash-in-transit van. But little did they know they had been on the cops’s radar for weeks. Instead of raining hell down on the unsuspecting cash-in-transit guards, they were met with a hail of bullets of righteousness! Police kept a close watch on the 25 suspects and just when they were about to bomb a cash van, cops pounced on them. They intercepted the suspects on their way to their safe house in The Hill near Rosettenville, south of Joburg, and chased them until they were cornered. The cops also had a helicopter in the sky as they hunted the thugs. With no place to hide, the suspects opened fire on the helicopter, injuring the pilot and assistant and a shoot-out took place. Eight of the suspects were shot and killed near and in their safe house. Eight others were arrested on the scene, while two others were arrested on Tuesday, 22 February.   Even more shocking was that two of the 25 suspects were cops. However they are still on the run. The cops also seized 10 high-performance vehicles as well as six AK47s, three rifles and explosives. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole commended all involved for a show of force and asserting the authority of the state. “This latest incident ought to send a clear message to all criminals that we are coming for all of them and that there is no longer a space for criminals to operate freely in South Africa. I also take this opportunity to wish all injured a speedy recovery,” he said. During his visit to the scene on Monday, 21 February, Police Minister Bheki Cele said: “We are working with heartless people who are prepared to kill. “I asked one of them, who is from Nquthu in KZN, what is happening and he said, ‘yi ndlala’. I said there is no hunger that will make you carry an AK47 and make you kill people,” said Cele. While a manhunt is still underway to apprehend the remaining suspects, police made a call for the suspects to hand themselves over to their nearest police station.
