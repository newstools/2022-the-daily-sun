ON WEDNESDAY, 23 February, the Gqeberha Regional Court ordered Raydson Lehlogonolo Ntsala to pay back the money he had swindled from a woman. Ntsala (35) was convicted last October for charges of fraud. According to Captain Yolisa Mgolodela, on 7 November 2017 while the victim was in Germany visiting her daughter, Ntsala hacked her computer. He then sent an email to the victim purporting to be their broker, who had previously indicated that he wanted to make an investment of R350 000 on her behalf. “The victim, upon receiving the email requesting the authorisation of the amount previously agreed upon, knowing the deal between herself and broker, authorised the amount of R350 000. “Thereafter, the victim contacted the broker checking if everything was in order but the broker had no knowledge about the investment. It was then established that the email was hacked,” Mgolodela said in a statement. She said the matter was reported to the Hawks for investigation, that resulted in Ntsala’s arrest in Rustenburg on 28 January 2021, and was released on R2 000 bail by the Gqeberha New Law Court. “He was sentenced to three years correctional supervision and instructed to pay back the complainant. He must pay R10 000 immediately, thereafter R3 500 per month to the complainant until the R350 000 is paid in full,” Mgolodela added.
