T he late Eddie Zondi’s daughter, Lula Odiba, is ready to take the entertainment industry by storm. The 24-year-old YFM presenter is following in her dad’s footsteps, making a name for herself on radio and TV. She told SunBuzz: “What I want to do while on YFM is to transition into TV channels such as MTV, Channel O and SABC. A few years from now, I want to be on a national station. There are so many ears I want to reach. I’m doing commercials and voice overs. I am also a DJ and an MC.” Asked if being the great Eddie Zondi’s daughter puts pressure on her, Lula said: “I don’t necessarily feel pressure. “It is a reference I can do it because I’ve seen my dad do it and live it. Instead of pressure, it is like a guide for me.” ALSO READ : AMANDA GETS NEW BOOBS!
