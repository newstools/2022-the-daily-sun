MANY stories have been published about people with powerful cars underestimating their power, misjudging their abilities, and crashing their cars. However, there are times when the owner of a supercar is not at fault, as was the case in this accident. The incident happened at the owner’s Beverly Hills driveway in which an apparently custom Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley were crashed into by a delivery truck. According to Carscoops, Pepe’s Towing Service, the company that posted the footage, says the owner has asked to remain anonymous. In a Facebook post about the crash, the company said that the Aventador was worth a million while the house was worth eight figures. The truck was reportedly fully loaded and lost its brakes, causing it to crash into the house.  Along with the Lamborghini and the Bentley, a Mercedes-Benz Maybach was also damaged in the accident. It was only a glancing blow, though, because it was apparently still intact enough to be driven out of the way.
