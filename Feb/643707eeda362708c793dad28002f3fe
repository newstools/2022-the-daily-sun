Mpumalanga Head of Department of health, Jabulani
Nkosi (58) has been granted R10 000 bail by the Nelspruit Magistrates Court on
Friday, 25 February. Nkosi handed himself over to the police today
afternoon and was charged with contravention of the Public Finance Management
Act of 1999. It is alleged that in May 2020, the accused was
employed as the acting HOD for the Department of Education, where he did not
follow a proper procurement process for the acquisition of protective personal
equipment for Covid-19, resulting in the department suffering a loss of almost
R22 million. Magistrate Suzan Monaledi said Nkosi must not
interfere with the state witnesses and that he reports to the investigating
officer when he is leaving Mpumalanga. The matter has been postponed to 20 April 2022 to
be transferred to the regional court.
