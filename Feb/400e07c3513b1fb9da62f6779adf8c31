THE two cousins and their uncle, who is alleged to have killed them, were buried on Saturday, 26 February at Mothutlung Cemetery in Mothutlung, North West. Daily Sun published the story of their death on 23 February. Their uncle, Simon Nyundo (33), allegedly took the cousins to buy sweets but they were found dead the following day. Simon allegedly told the family where the dead children were hidden and he was burnt to death by angry residents. Nelly Nyundo (26), the mother of Onkarabile Nyundo (4), and Gloria Nyundo (30), the mother of Promise Nyundo (6), cried uncontrollably during the funeral. “We are trying to cope but the healing process takes time,” she said. Nelly appealed to all mums to always know their kids’ whereabouts and who they’re with. She said she didn’t know if her brother, Simon, was alone during the murder or if someone else was involved. Sunday School teacher at Flames Christian Family Church, Kuhlayiseka Tivane, said she spent the day in bed when she heard the kids were dead. “My sister comforted me and said it’s good to mourn and cry as it shows the measure of love that I had for the children,” she said. Bokamoso Creche owner, Ruth Malatsi, where Onkarabile was attending, said it was difficult to know that the little boy is gone. Deputy Principal at Isaac Mokoena Primary School, Albert Motsepe, said Promise was starting his foundation at school as he was doing Grade R. “He would have been a great pupil. May God comfort the family,” he said. ANC Women’s League National Representative, Kebafilwe Mogale, also expressed her shock. The cousins and uncle died on 17 February in Mothutlung. Onkarabile and Promise went missing on 16 February 2022 at Extension 1 in Mothutlung.
