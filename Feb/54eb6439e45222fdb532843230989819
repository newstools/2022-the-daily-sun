AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has admitted his side were interested in Orlando Pirates defender Bongani Sam, but his hopes were rejected by the Soweto giants. McCarthy caused a huge uproar last week when he said on radio that he was interested in Sam and went as far as exchanging messages with the former Bloemfontein Celtic defender, admitting that he wanted to leave Pirates and join AmaZulu. However, Bucs rejected the AmaZulu interest. The Durban-based side were also interested in Nkanyiso Zungu in the January window. And just like Sam, Pirates also rejected AmaZulu interest in Zungu. Sam (24), who joined Pirates from Bloemfontein Celtic in 2019, has featured little this season, with seven appearances in all competitions. Bucs co-coaches Mandla Ncikazi and Fadlu Davids have preferred Paseka Mako at left-back this season. “Yes, I was very interested in the player but Pirates made it clear that he wasn’t going anywhere,” said McCarthy. “So there’s nothing I can do. You have to respect the club he plays for.” However, McCarthy said he was in fact asked about Bongani Zungu in an interview and he got the question wrong. Bongani Zungu will see his contract with French side Amiens expire at the end of June. “I’m a big fan of the young man, but there was a bit of miscommunication because the question was about Bongani Zungu and mistakenly I thought it was Bongani Sam,” said McCarthy. “So I was explaining my feelings.” McCarthy’s interest in Sam doesn’t come as a surprise. The player is represented by McCarthy’s long time agent, Rob Moore, though he lives in London and Moore’s son is the one who is dealing with Mzansi players.
