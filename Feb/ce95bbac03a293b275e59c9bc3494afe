IT took Sekhukhune United five games to end their win-less run in the DStv Premiership.But it was worth the wait as they produced a top-class performance to record an emphatic 4-0 victory over Baroka at the Ellis Park Stadium on Sunday. It was the biggest win this season for the newly promoted Babina Noko. Justin Shonga scored on debut in the third minute with a tap-in, while leading goal scorer with seven goals, Chibuike Ohizu, completed a brace on either side of half-time. Ohizu had not scored since October and scored not one, but two goals in the 24th and 68th minute to get the monkey off his back. Vusimuzi Mncube added the cherry on top with a fourth goal to compound Baroka’s miserable evening. The win moved Babina Noko to sixth place on the log table with 28 points from 19 games, while their provincial rivals remained at the bottom of the table with 14 points from the same games. Had it not been for goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze, the margin could have been higher for the home side. Sekhukhune had beaten Royal AM 1-0 at the same venue to record their last win on 20 November and deservedly ended their winless run emphatically to ease the pressure on coach MacDonald Makhubedu. Goalkeeper Toaster Nsabata equaled Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango with nine clean sheets to celebrate a personal milestone. Baroka had just one short on target in the first half and declined the second half to suffer their biggest defeat since 2017. Coach Kgoloko Thobejane reacted with a double substitution after 30 minutes, bringing in Evidence Makgopa and Train Makhabi for Nhlanhla Mgaga and Ntiyiso Mbombi. Chipezeze and Vusi Sibiya summed up the awful night for Baroka when they combined to make a defensive error to give Ohizu a gift.
