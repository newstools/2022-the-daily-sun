AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has bemoaned the tough Nedbank Cup draw his side face when they play Orlando Pirates in the last-23 at Orlando Stadium on Sunday. However, facing Pirates, the 2014 Ke Yona champions, McCarthy will have a chance to finally beat them as Usuthu coach. “I’m waiting for my Nedbank Cup dream where I can also experience the Ke Yona (winning) feeling because since I became a coach, at Cape Town City and now at AmaZulu, every Nedbank Cup game, I either get Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns or Bidvest Wits,” said McCarthy. “I’ve never been drawn against a GladAfrica Championship or lower division team. I don’t know if it’s written in the sky that I’m meant to play for DStv Premiership teams throughout my career while I coach in the PSL. “However, we will deal with it. But it couldn’t come any tougher than Orlando Pirates,” revealed McCarthy. “We have already played them twice this season. It was a draw (0-0) and loss (2-1) because my players’ mindset was already on holiday and on the (Festive Season) break. AmaZulu have not defeated Pirates in all competitions since August 2013.
