IN their bid to zoom to the top eight bracket, TS Galaxy received a big boost last night snatching a vital away point from AmaZulu in their dull DStv Premiership draw at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Galaxy are slowly climbing up the log table having moved from the bottom to occupy 13th spot – tied with Chippa United on 17 points from 19 matches. AmaZulu missed the chance to close down the gap between themselves and teams that are within the top five, as they are sitting in seventh position on 28 points from 21 matches. The only positive for AmaZulu is that they will host Algerian side ES Setif in their Caf Champions League Group B match at the King Zwelithini Stadium on Friday (6pm) without having lost the Galaxy match. AmaZulu beat Guinea side Horoya AC 1-0 in the Champions League Group B match played at the same venue last Friday, and Galaxy beat fellow relegation candidates Swallows FC by the same margin. The Rockets were aiming to register their third successive win on the road having also beaten another Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs by the same margin in the Nedbank Cup first round. Usuthu coach Benni McCarthy made three changes to his starting line-up that beat Horoya with defenders – Thembela Sikhakhane, Samkelo Mgwazela and Abbubaker Mobara – getting the nod. His counterpart, Sead Ramovic, made just one change to the side that beat Birds, as he gave Macbeth Mahlangu a run to plug the gap in defence. He relied on the partnership of Lindokuhle Mbatha and Augustine Kwem upfront.
