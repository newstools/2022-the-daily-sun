NYIKO Bilankulu has hit back at popular amapiano producer and artist DJ Maphorisa. This comes after Maphorisa accused Nyiko, Lindokuhle “Mlindo the Vocalist” Magedezi’s manager, of back stabbing him and failing to pay him royalties. Maphorisa made the allegations on Facebook and Daily Sun previously reported on it. In an exclusive interview, Nyiko said: “I didn’t want to entertain Maphorisa but I feel obliged to defend myself. Maphorisa neglected Mlindo for two years. He forced Mlindo to do amapiano and when he refused, Maphorisa threatened to dump him. There was a huge fight and as Mlindo’s manager, I needed to step in and save his career.” He accused Maphorisa, who signed Mlindo under his record label Blaqboy, of failing to support Mlindo when he needed him the most. “When Mlindo bought his mother a house, Maphorisa was not there. When Mlindo had two car accidents in 2020, Maphorisa was not there. He was nowhere to be found. He ran away from problems and I had to step up for Mlindo. Today, Mlindo is the number one best selling artist in SA. This was a team effort and Maphorisa was not part of it,” he said.

Mlindo listened to questions before putting the phone down. Several attempts were made to call him back but he didn’t answer.
