TS GALAXY has completed the signing of veteran defender Mzwanele Mahashe. The 33-year-old was among the players that Royal AM released during the January transfer period. He joined Galaxy on a one-year six-month deal. The former Baroka FC man has already started training with The Rockets. On Thursday, he was part of the squad when they were preparing for their Nedbank Cup last-32 match against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. Talking about their new signings, which includes veteran defender Vuyo Mere, Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi said they lacked experience and leadership, "We needed leaders in the club," Sukazi said. "We are a young team with young players. We needed a leader like Vuyo, who is the legend of the game. "Not only him, but there is also another leader, big player Mzwanele Mahashe, a good solid defender, is here. We have signed him. It was a subject of transfers at the time with the three (Mxolisi Macuphu, Marlon Heugh and Shaune Mogaila) that went down to Royal AM. Sukazi added: "He is a player that I have been talking to for some time. He is a leader and we are happy to have him." Mahashe joined Mere, Shane Roberts and Lefa Hlongwane, who joined Galaxy during the January transfer period. Mahashe is expected to play a vital role in helping Galaxy avoid relegation in the remaining DStv Premiership matches as they are not in a safe position. Galaxy are languishing at the bottom of the table with 13 points after 17 league matches.
