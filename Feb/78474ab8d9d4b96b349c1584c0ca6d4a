THEMBI Mahlangu and Maureen Mphela used to do hair in school for pocket money. They went their separate ways after high school, but have since reunited to run a salon together. The 29-year-olds from Vezubuhle near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, opened their salon in 2020. Thembi told Daily Sun she used to plait her friends’ hair in grade 7. “I met Maureen in high school and we did hair for money. We went our separate ways after matric. “However, both our salons failed and we decided to reunite and try again. So we opened the salon together. We bring different skills in hair styling,” she said. She said they also do manicures and pedicures. “My friend taught me and it boosts our business,” she said. Maureen said her mum had an Afro and she used to plait her hair. “I never went to school to be a hairstylist. I taught myself and I sometimes went to salons just to watch. I learnt other skills from the internet. We both come with different skills in this business, which I think will help us,” she said. The business partners said they are open to teaching other young girls their skills. They said they were never meant to separate and are sure they will be successful this time around.
