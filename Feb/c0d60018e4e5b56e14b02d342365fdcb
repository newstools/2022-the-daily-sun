SWALLOWS FC came from behind defeat TS Sporting in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 match at the Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Swallows started the match brightly and created the better chances in the opening exchanges, and they should have at least been 2-0 up in the first 15 minutes of the lively encounter but the were not clinical in front of goal. Sporting broke the deadlock in the 20th minute after goalkeeper Thela Thela denied Ibroihim Youssouf a scoring opportunity sending back the ball to the pitch and Sibusiso Fakude scored from close range to take the lead. Swallows dominated the first half but couldn’t find a way past Sporting's defense. They did everything right except for putting the ball into the back of a net. Monnapule Saleng created chances in front of the goal but none of his teammates managed to find a finishing touch in the opening half. Veteran defender Rooi Mahamutsa was rock solid at the back dealing with all the threats the Dube birds posed at them in the first half. In the second half, Swallows showed strength and character as they managed to come from a goal down to win the match. Yagan Sasman levelled the matters in the 48th minute of the match. It was not long after super-sub Razaigh Gamildien scored the winner to help the birds fly into the round of 16. It was Benson Mhlongo’s first game in charge of his second spell at Sporting and he now has to go back to the drawing box to find solutions before the Championship resumes. Swallows joined Mamelodi Sundowns and University of Pretoria who booked their places in the last-16 on Friday beating Richards Bay FC 4-0 and Chippa United 2-0 respectively
