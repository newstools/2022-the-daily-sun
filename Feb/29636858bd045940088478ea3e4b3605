Actor Fezile Makhanya is making major moves. He’s joined the cast of 1Magic’s popular telenovela The River as Mnqobi Luthuli, a charismatic pastor and politician. Fezile told SunBuzz it was fate that he got the role. “This is because a few days prior to getting it, I was thinking to myself of how wonderful it would be to get a role on the show and as fortune would have it, I got the call and was asked if I’d be interested in playing this particular role,” he said. “I couldn’t decline and I’m very excited to be adding value and telling a different side of the story to the show,” he said. Fezile said he enjoyed stepping into Mnqobi’s shoes, who has a lot of rivals as he’s stepped on many people’s toes. “He’s honestly a nice guy. I don’t want to give away the whole storyline. People need to watch and see how everything unfolds. “But what I can say is I enjoyed myself because he’s very different from the other roles I’ve played in the past,” he shared. “Mnqobi goes out of his way to get what he wants. He’s a lucky guy who is easy to get along with. He’s a well-to-do kind of person with a colourful lifestyle.

Quite a lot of sleepless nights in the beginning, but one gets the hang of it,” he said. Fezile, who has previously been a part of shows such Isono and iNkaba, and has been in the entertainment industry for almost 20 years, said that right now the sky is the limit. “I’m not one to talk too much about what is next, you’ll have to see it yourself. “All I will say is, the time has come to explore my other God-given talents within and outside of the industry,” he said. Fezile will make his first appearance on The River tomorrow, Friday 11 February.
