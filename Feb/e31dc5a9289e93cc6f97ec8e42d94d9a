SuperSport United have FINALLY signed former Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City star Aubrey Ngoma to beef up their midfield. Ngoma, 32, struggled to get game time at the star-studded Brazilians managing three appearances in two years. He received an invitation to train with the three-time league champions by Coach Kaitano Tembo during the break. Ngoma impressed the technical team and earned a one-year deal with an option to renew.An insider confirmed that the former Cape Town City star signed on the dotted line on Wednesday afternoon. “Yes, Ngoma is officially a SuperSport United player. He is not match fit because he did not play for a long time. The club decided to give him a chance and strengthened the midfield,” said the official. Ngoma could make his debut against Royal AM at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville on Sunday at 3.30pm. He will start the game against Royal AM from the bench and get a few minutes to play. “He has been working hard in training and showed that he can add value to the team. He will serve as a motivation to the young players. He will help the club reach its target of finishing in the top six with his experience,” added the source. Ngoma is the third signing from Sundowns, and he joined former teammates Sifiso Ngobeni and Soumahoro Bangarly. Ngoma will be officially unveiled by the club on Thursday, and his teammates are excited to have him at the club.
