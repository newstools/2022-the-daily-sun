ORLANDO Pirates have let slip an opportunity to close the massive gap opened by Mamelodi Sundowns at the top of the DStv Premiership table. This after they were held to a goalless draw by a determined Golden Arrows at the Orlando Stadium yesterday. Pirates had a chance to reduce the huge 17-point-gap to 15 points with the defending champions set to be on a mini-league hiatus due to their Caf Champions League commitments. However, the Soweto giants came unstuck against the KwaZulu Natal outfit who were desperate to change their fortunes. Arrows, yet to register a win in their last four matches in all competitions, were looking to stop the rot against the Buccaneers. Lehlohonolo Seema’s side was also looking to bounce back from an embarrassing defeat to GladAfrica Championship side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the Nedbank Cup. They started strong and were almost rewarded when Nduduzo Sibiya’s well-struck free-kick struck the woodwork. Pirates were rattled and they began creating opportunities of their own, none better than the one squandered by Deon Hotto on his weaker right foot. Bucs upped the ante in the second half as they looked to break the deadlock, but substitute Zakhele Lepasa was thwarted by Nkosingiphile Gumede in the Arrows goal. In the end, a share of the spoils is what both teams were forced to settle for. Pirates will be away on Caf Confederation Cup duty in Libya next where they face A-Ittihad. The match will take place at the Martyrs of February Stadium in Benina on Sunday (6pm). Bucs will be looking to maintain their perfect start to the group stages and strengthen their position at the top of Group B. Abafana Bes'thende, on the other hand, will be in league action against Cape Town City at the Princess Magogo Stadium on the same day (3.30pm).
