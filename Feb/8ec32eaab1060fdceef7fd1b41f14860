Victor Letsoalo’s solitary goal helped Royal AM to overcome fellow PSL rookies Sekhukhune United 1-0 in a DStv Premiership match at Chatsworth Stadiumon Tuesday. Letsoalo took advantage of Nkanyiso Madonsela’s poor clearance to unleash a thunderous low shot giving Sekhukhune keeper Toaster Nsabata no chance in the 48th minute to grab his 10th league goal of the season. Royal AM are a point behind Orlando Pirates and they trail run away leaders Mamelodi Sundowns by 19 points having collected 29 points from 18 matches. Sekhukhune are still in eighth position on 25 points from 18 matches. This was the first time John Maduka’s coached scored against Babina Noko in four matches dating back from their campaign in the GladAfrica Championship last season. The Durban side avenged the 1-0 defeat they suffered to Sekhukhune in the first round match played in November last year. They came into the match with their heads held up high having beaten Cape Town City 2-1 at the same venue last Friday to progress to the Nedbank Cup last 16 round. Maduka included former Sundowns defender Ricardo Nascimento in his starting line-up to make his debut having joined them last week. The Brazilian made an impression as he lasted for 70 minutes on the pitch before he was replaced by Wandile Mabuza. His counterpart, MacDonald Makhubedu made two changes to the side that lost 3-2 on penalties to GladAfrica Champions side Platinum City Rovers in the Ke Yona Cup with veteran midfielder Willard Katsande and striker Katleho Cwinyane regaining their place in the starting line-up. Makhubedu was unable to field his two new recruits Rodriegues Kabwe and Justin Shonga despite travelling to Durban with the club as they were still waiting for their work permit.
