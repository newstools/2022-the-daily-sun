A WOMAN has been living in fear since thugs started terrorising her on 4 February. The 35-year-old from Springs, Ekurhuleni, who didn’t want to be named, said her ordeal started when she had just left her home to go to work and four thugs pounced on her. They forced her back into her house and demanded money. When she told them she didn’t have any, they klapped her and pepper sprayed her. They forced her to open her banking app to send them money but her battery died before she could complete the transaction. They then tied her up and locked her in the bathroom before going to an ATM with her card. However, the card was swallowed and they returned to demand another card, which they used to withdraw R3 000. They came back and forced her to do a cash send transaction for another R5 000. They left with her TV, clothes, shoes and jewellery. The woman went to the police station on Monday, 7 February but while she was there, she received a call telling her not to open a case. When she got home, she found a box at her gate with the gate remote control, a set of keys and a bullet inside. On Thursday 10 February, she received a message reading: “We are giving you one day to respond. We are coming back.” On Friday 18 February, she finally gathered the courage to open a case at the Springs Police Station. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said cops were investigating a case of intimidation and robbery.
