ORLANDO Pirates’ have come unstuck in the Caf Confederation Cup – suffering their first defeat in the group stages of the competition. Bucs lost 3-2 to Libyan outfit Al-Ittihad in a five-goal thriller at the Martyrs of February Stadium in Benina on Sunday. They couldn’t maintain the momentum gained from their comfortable 2-0 win over JS Saoura in their first group match. The result means it’s anybody’s game in Group B with both Pirates and Al-Ittihad having registered respective home victories. Al-Ittihad signaled their intentions early in the match, getting off to a flying start and putting Bucs on the backfoot from the start. They broke the deadlock through Sanad Al Ouarfali as early as the 13th minute but they couldn’t hold on for too long as Bandile Shandu restored parity. The hosts, however, continued to pile the pressure on Downs and they got the second through Muad Eisay in the 28th minute. But Shandu, who was having a sterling first half, was on the scoresheet again as he sealed his brace with the equalizer on the stroke of half time. Bucs’ defensive frailties in the match reared their ugly head again as they went down for the third time in the 53rd minute through Omar Al Khouja. And try as they might, they could not find the equalizer this time around and succumbed to defeat. Bucs will now turn their attention to Royal Leopards in their third group match on Sunday away from home. They will hope wrestle back control in the group and map out their way into the knockout stages – which is their big goal. Bucs will also have one eye on the Soweto derby which takes place on 5 March. As for Al-Ittihad, they next face Saora in their second group match on Sunday.
