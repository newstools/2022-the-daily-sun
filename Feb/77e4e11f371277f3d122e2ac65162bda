STELLENBOSCH reserve team have closed the gap on leaders Orlando Pirates at the top of the DStv Diski Challenge table. Stellies coach Evangelos Vellios said a clinical performance earned them a 3-0 win against Mamelodi Sundowns reserves in the Diski Challenge on Saturday. Stellies’ victory saw them reduce the gap between themselves and league leaders Pirates to one point after 18 games. Said Vellios: “We had a good performance. The players were clinical on the day, and we took our chances early on. “We went to the break with a 2-0 lead which allowed us to control the game.” Stellies have accumulated 39 points while the young Buccaneers remain on 40 points after dropping points in a 3-2 loss to Chippa United. Vellios said he will stick to the club’s objectives and the targets he set for his players to avoid putting them under pressure to win the league, despite being a point behind Pirates. “We’ve set ourselves a target to try to reach 60 or 70 points to win the league. That’s all we can focus on because we can’t control what other teams do. “We just try to run our race,” he said. He promises they are going to run the marathon at a pace that they can handle. “I know it sounds a bit cliche, but I said to the players, let’s just focus on ourselves and our targets and objectives and that’s what matters the most to us,” he said. He told SunSport setting small targets has helped his team this season and they will continue using the same strategy in the last 12 matches. “We want to win at least two of the next three games,” he said. Stellies march to 60 points or better start on Saturday against in-form Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium (10am).
