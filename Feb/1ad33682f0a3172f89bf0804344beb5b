A BLESSER shocked slay queen Lerato Makgatho when he bought her a R2,5 million house for Valentine’s Day! The 28-year-old, popularly known as Habiba, had not been in the public eye for a while and was living in an RDP at Rama City, Tshwane, when the huge surprise came. She said when she got the house at Magaliesberg Country Estate in Amandasig, Tshwane, she felt like she had won the lotto. She said her blesser was the new man in her life. “To be honest, I didn’t expect much. Since Friday, he had been talking about how much he loved me. He promised me something big but I didn’t expect a house,” she said. Habiba said their relationship is three months old. “He is a gentleman and he never rushed me. He is different to other guys with money and power as most of them are cruel and heartless,” she said. Habiba made headlines in 2020 when she told Daily Sun she had affairs with former finance minister Tito Mboweni and Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe, who she called a tiger in bed. Her blesser (41), who’s married with kids, said he gave Habiba the house because he believed in empowering women. “Habiba is special to me. She is beautiful, humble, talented and very focused. When I met her, I was expecting a gold digger, attention-seeker and drama queen but she is actually humble and intelligent,” he said. However, he said his first love would always be his wife as she had been with him through thick and thin.
