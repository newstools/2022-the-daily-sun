THE state is in the process of wrapping up its case against Ntuthuko Shoba, the alleged mastermind behind the murder of eight-months pregnant Tshegofatso Pule. In his testimony today, Thursday 10 February, Colonel Aubrey Maisela from the detectives, cyber crime and deep web investigations unit said he was contacted by investigating officer Captain Bongani Mpete to help verify if WhatsApp was installed on Shoba’s cellphone. He said: “I struggled to open the WhatsApp on the handset because it was blocked and I couldn’t access the messages. Mpete came to me yesterday and gave me a USB that had reports extracted from Shoba’s first phone.” Maisela explained that Tuesday, 8 February was the first time he was asked to analyse Shoba’s second phone. “I looked at the forensic report from the Hawks and concluded there were messages between Shoba and Tshegofatso, some of them threatening in nature,” he said. Maisela could extract messages that weren’t on Shoba’s first phone, meaning they were deleted. Defence Advocate Norman Makhubela said it was amusing that suddenly there were messages between Tshegofatso and Shoba on the first phone. Explaining this, Sergeant Mpe Teme said he didn’t find any messages between the two, assuming Shoba could have saved Tshegofatso’s number under a different name. However, Maisela stressed he had expertise in extracting information that Teme didn’t have. Makhubela has asked to bring in two witnesses, Qondeni Mkhutshulwa, known as Muzikayise Malephane’s girlfriend, as well as Zakhele Sithole, Shoba’s friend who accompanied him to Cashbuild the day after Tshegofatso’s murder. The matter will resume to court on Monday, 14 February.
