AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy is spitting fire again, lamenting the “poor” standard of officiating in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). McCarthy was left bitterly disappointed by some of the decisions in their 1-0 loss to Orlando Pirates in their Nedbank Cup last-32 clash played at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday. Usuthu were dumped out of the Ke Yona Cup and McCarthy reckons this wouldn’t have happened had the referee, Masixole Bambiso, been on top of his game. McCarthy counted as many as three “clear-cut” penalty shouts that were NOT given, resulting in a narrow defeat for Usuthu. “I have always been a person who is true to himself, his team and his players. I have always been an honest footballer, so I expect my team to be as honest as possible and not go down without contact. “We are not sissies or kids. We are playing a man’s game. We know this game is about physicality,” said McCarthy. “I expect the referees to be well trained and professional enough to know when a penalty is a penalty, and when a player is trying to con them. If you see there’s a penalty there, you give the benefit until the ball runs out and then you go back and you give the decision. “Whether the player is honest or not, the man in the middle doesn’t have the confidence nor the knowledge to do the right thing. “Because it’s Orlando Pirates or a bigger team, they (referees) are afraid to make the right decisions and the game suffers. “They are not doing us any favours. It’s their job. “We expect the referees to be quality and have enough knowledge and experience to make the right decisions.” McCarthy’s Usuthu will now turn their focus to the Caf Champions League group stages, where they kick off proceedings with a clash against Moroccan giants Raja Casablanca at the Stade Mohammed V on Saturday (9pm).
