In what should come as a shock to many, Brazilian, Ricardo Nascimento has joined Royal AM on a two seasons contract with an option to renew. Nascimento just parted ways with Mamelodi Sundowns this week and bid his goodbyes on Wednesday, as reported by SunSport. It is understood that Nascimento has been in talks with the club since the announcement of him leaving Sundowns. Royal AM chief executive, Sinky Mnisi, confirmed on Thursday that Nascimento is now their player. "We're very pleased to have secured a talented defender like Nascimento on a 17-months contract, with option," said Mnisi on Thursday."This will stabilise our team. This clearly shows our intensions this season."
