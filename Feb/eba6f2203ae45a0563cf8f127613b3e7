AS far as debuts go in Test cricket, they hardly come tougher than that of Sarel Erwee. The 32-year-old Proteas batsman was given the baptism of fire by a ruthless New Zealand bowling attack in the first of two Test matches last week. He was part of a South African team that suffered their second heaviest defeat in history – an innings and 276 runs thumping. It took the hosts two and half days to wrap up a convincing win over the Proteas in what was a performance to forget for the tourists. Erwee, who finally got to make his long awaited debut thanks to the absence of Keegan Petersen, found the going tough as did the rest of the Proteas batters. The left-handed opener made scores of 0 and 10 in his two innings. “It wasn’t the kind of debut I had in mind,” Erwee admitted. “I don’t think many have had a debut like that, where the result doesn’t go their way. The conditions were probably the most testing I have ever faced but it was an incredible experience, nonetheless. “It was just disappointing that as a team we did not get the result that we wanted. I think we just didn’t adapt well enough to the conditions.” Erwee believes he, along with the entire team, will bounce back from the painful experience. They will need to fix their mistakes ahead of the second Test at Hagley Oval tomorrow. “We’re a strong unit and we are going to back each other and bounce back in the second Test, hopefully,” added Erwee. “We’re in a position where we know our backs are against the wall, and the only way you’re going to get out of it is if you take that first step, fight and throw the first punch. As South Africans, that’s what we thrive on and we’re going to have to do that.”
