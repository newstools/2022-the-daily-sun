AN 18-YEAR-OLD mother from Mthatha, Eastern Cape, has been arrested for allegedly abandoning her baby. A passerby found the five-month-old baby girl at a forest on Saturday, 29 January. Warrant officer Majola Nkohli said police were called to the scene, and the matter was handled as stipulated in the Children’s Act, leading to placement in the place of safety. “Preliminary investigation led to the arrest of a teen suspect on Tuesday,” said Nkohli. Police opened a case of child abandonment. He said the following day, the accused briefly appeared in the Mthatha Magistrates Court on the said charges and was remanded in custody. “The case was postponed to Wednesday, 9 February, for a bail application,” added Nkohli. A resident said there was no reason for the young mum to dump the baby. “I hope she is denied bail because what she did was very cruel. Why did she dump the baby? What if something had happened to her?” asked the resident. Another resident Sibusiso Zaphu (45) said the baby was left with two bottles of formula. “The mum does not deserve to have a baby. If she didn’t want her, she could have given her to someone else instead of dumping her.” Another resident said if women did not want kids, they needed to use a condom or stop having sex. “Use a contraceptive. If one finds this difficult to do, they must stop having sex. We cannot have women who continue dumping kids; it needs to stop.”
