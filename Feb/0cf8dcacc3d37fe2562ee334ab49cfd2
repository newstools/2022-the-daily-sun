AMAZULU are aiming to end Orlando Pirates dominance over them when the teams meet in the Nedbank Cup last 32 round at Orlando Stadium on Sunday (3pm). AmaZulu have won only once compared to seven victories for Bucs in 17 matches with nine draws. Usuthu also failed to overcome the Soweto giants on three occasions last year having lost 1-0 in May, drawn 1-1 on 8 December, and lost 2-1 in their last league meeting on 23 December. However, Usuthu captain Makhehleni Makhaula believes they can overcome Bucs in their own backyard this time if they show the right mentality and score early. Said Makhaula: “We can overcome them this time, but it will depend how desperate we are during the game and applying the right mentality. Our coach (Benni McCarthy) can do anything on the ground, but it will be tough if we don’t communicate well (on the pitch). We have a good chance of progressing further if we take our chances early.” Makhaula admitted that their poor record against Bucs is a worrying factor. “Our record is not well, they either beat us, or we draw the game. But you will never know what will happen this time. The fact that there are no supporters can help us or not, but at the end of day it will depend how much we want to progress. Having everyone available with no injuries gives us confidence.” The Randfontein born player believes victory will boost their morale for their crucial Caf Champions League group stage matches. AmaZulu will host Guinea side Horoya on 18 February, then tackle Algerian outfit ES Setif away before meeting Raja Casablanca. “If we win it will lift our confidence in Caf matches.”
