GOGO Salome Rammetsi hasn’t been able to live peacefully since water started gushing out from the tar road near her house. The 67-year-old from Atteridgeville, Tshwane, told Daily Sun water had been flowing out of the road non-stop since November 2021 and it was damaging her wall. She said as soon as she noticed the problem, she notified the municipality but nothing was done. She said at the beginning, there wasn’t that much water but the problem became worse over time. “My yard is always wet because of the water and my bill has gone up, which I suspect is because of the leak,” she said. Gogo Salome said she had been trying to get help but all she got were reference numbers. The gogo’s neighbour, madala Carlos Shai (79) said his bill also rose after the problem started. He said he believed they were paying for water that was being wasted. City of Tshwane spokesman Sipho Stuurman said he would forward the matter to the relevant department.
