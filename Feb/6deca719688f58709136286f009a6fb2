THREE men were injured on Monday, 28 February when two motor vehicles crashed into each other on Justice Mahomed Street, Pretoria. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said just before 6am, medics found one vehicle on its roof on the pavement, while the other was on the side of the road. “One man was found lying trapped in the overturned vehicle. Rescue services personnel had to use special equipment to free the man from the car, an operation lasting almost two hours,” Meiring said. Once released, medics found one survivor was in a critical condition while the man from the other car was in a serious condition. “Medics treated the patients and provided them with advanced life support before they were transported to nearby hospitals. It is understood another service transported another man in a serious condition before the ER24 arrived.” Meiring added that local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
