ORLANDO Pirates co-coach Mandla Ncikazi said the DStv Premiership trophy is already inside Mamelodi Sundowns' trophy cabinet. Sundowns are currently 17 points clear of Orlando Pirates at the top of the table, having lost one league match in 21 played so far this season. And it pretty much looks like a one-horse race to claim the league title while the rest of the chasing pack are left to fight over who finishes second on the table.In an interview with Soccer Laduma, Ncikazi says that nobody is going to catch Sundowns this season. "We just have to focus on ourselves and try and gather as much points as possible and get Pirates to the right level, try and play the type of football that is related to the club," Ncikazi."I know the gap is too big between us and (Mamelodi) Sundowns, but we just have to focus on ourselves."It is only Sundowns who can take the cup out of their cabinet for competition – but I think the cup is already in their cabinet," Ncikazi added.Pirates claimed a goalless draw on Wednesday against Golden Arrows which saw them missing on opportunity of closing the chasm between them and Sundowns. This weekend Pirates will be playing in Caf Confederations Cup against Al-Ittihad on Sunday at 6pm. -TeamTalk Media
