HE WAS chilling in his house drinking beer when suddenly, three thugs burst in. Give us money, they shouted but he had none, so they shot him twice. Then they said, hang on, we're sorry we shot you! It was Saturday, 29 January when three thugs suddenly forced the locked door open. They assaulted him and shot him once in each thigh. But the thugs then realised they were in the wrong house. They were meant to rob the house next door. So they apologised to the man for shooting him. And one of the thugs felt so guilty he held the 50-year-old man from Duduza, Ekurhuleni by hand and escorted him to a neighbour, where he asked for an ambulance to take him to hospital. The man was taken to hospital for treatment and was discharged on Sunday, 30 January. He is now asking himself which one of his neighbours he took a bullet for. “One of the thugs told my neighbour they shot me by mistake and begged my neighbour to call ambulance to take me to hospital,” he said. The man said despite apologising, the thugs still ransacked his house and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash and new linen. The handyman, who survives on odd jobs, said he won’t be able to work for some time because of the injuries he sustained during the attack. “I’m in pain and can’t walk properly. Doctors told me to keep exercising although it’s painful. “It’s going to be tough on me because I will have stay home until I recover fully,” he said. The man said the thugs told him not to report the matter to the police or they would come back for him. Police spokesman Sergeant Harry Manaka said cops were looking for the suspects. “The suspects also took two cellphones and two beers. But as they left, one of the suspects apologised that they actually went into the wrong house. They wanted to rob his next door neighbour,” said Manaka. He said the suspects fled on foot. “The suspects are unknown. Anyone with information should call Duduza police on 071 675 7027, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
