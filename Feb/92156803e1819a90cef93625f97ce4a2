FOUR suspects aged 30 to 39 were bust just after robbing a shop at Ilanga Mall in Mbombela on Monday, 7 February. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said among them was a former police sergeant who previously worked at the Crime Intelligence office in Mpumalanga. “According to the report, at about 8am today, a group of armed suspects stormed into a shop where they held the employees hostage, tied them with cable ties before robbing them of cellphones and laptops as well as cash and computer boxes. “Meanwhile, one of the workers at the shop was fortunately inside the bathroom during the robbery and managed to call for help.” Mohlala said security officers at the mall responded quickly. They cornered the suspects moments later as they tried to flee from the scene using a white Toyota Corolla Quest without a number plate or a licence disc. “Police were notified and went immediately to the scene.
