TODAY is D-day for Banyana Banyana. By the end of today, Banyana will know if they are going to Morocco to compete in the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations finals or not. Banyana will be up against The Fennecs of Algeria in the second leg of their qualifying round at Omar Hamadi Stadium in Algiers tonight (7pm SA time). Coach Desiree Ellis’s charges are 2-0 up, having won the first leg at Orlando Stadium last Friday. They will be hoping to finish off the job this evening and book their spot in Morocco for the finals, which will be played from 2-23 July. Banyana players are heading to this encounter, knowing what is at stake. Failure will not only mean they are not going to Morocco, but will also end their 2023 Fifa World Cup dream as the tournament also serves as a World Cup qualifier. Banyana need a win or a draw to qualify. A 1-0 defeat would still work in their favour, but the team is not thinking about losing the game. They want a win at all costs. Ellis said they would need an early goal to kill off the match. “The first 20 minutes will be key. We will need to be cautious and try to get a goal to kill off the match,” said Ellis. “With the 2-0 lead, we cannot think or say we are done. This is a dangerous score. We have to make sure we do not concede.”
