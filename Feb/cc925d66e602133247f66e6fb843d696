POPULAR social media user Nompilo Dlamini has gone back home after spending the past few months in India. Nompilo, who is struggling with cystic fibrosis, went to India late last year in the hope of getting a lung transplant, but it didn’t happen. The well-known 26-year-old from Eswatini decided to come back home and said she was tired of being medicated. After landing in her motherland, she posted a photo of herself, saying she is now home. “Praise God for the travelling mercies. I am finally home,” she said. Rapper Cassper Nyovest, who played a huge role in getting her funds to travel to India for the lung transplant, commented on her photo and told her to stay strong. “Stay up, champ,” he said.

I don’t want to keep on fighting. I’ve fought enough. Now it’s just time I ask God to give me rest from this battle. My job is finished. May God do His will,” she captioned a video. “I have inspired people and taught them how to smile even when you are in pain. I am done with medication. I am just going to let God do His will,” she said. Praise God for the travelling mercies, I am finally home ?????? pic.twitter.com/ekaoD9b1Yd
