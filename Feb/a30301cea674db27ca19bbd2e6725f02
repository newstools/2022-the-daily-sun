BAROKA midfielder Bennet Bobete says their performances in their last two matches have been encouraging and he is positive they can win the Limpopo derby again. Since the Absa Premiership resumed two weeks ago, Baroka have managed to beat Stellenbosch FC 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup last-32, and also put a brave fight in their league’s 1-1 draw against high-flying log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Monday. And now the 21-year-old has predicted another victory in the Limpopo Premiership derby against Sekhukhune United at Ellis Park Stadium on Sunday (6pm). The Ga-Mphahlele-based outfit managed to beat Babina Noko 1-0 in their league first round derby clash with Bafana Bafana star Evidence “Tower” Makgopa netting the winning goal. “Our performance in our past two matches have been encouraging for us,” said Bobete, who has been impressive in his debut season in the top flight. “I think if we play like we did against Stellenbosch and Sundowns, I see us beating Sekhukhune again. This clash is not only about three points but also bragging rights. “The feeling was exciting when we beat them in the first round. We are also not safe from the danger zone and nothing but a win will boost our chance to move away (from the relegation zone). “The good thing is that the morale is high and the team is looking good. We can’t wait for Sunday.” Baroka are 15th in the Premiership with 14 points – only a point ahead of bottom club TS Galaxy. United on the other hand are coming to this clash without a win in six consecutive league matches. The last time United won a league match was on the 5 December when they beat SuperSport United 1-0. Last week, United suffered an embarrassment after being knocked out of Ke Yona Cup by GladAfrica Championship side Platinum City Rovers, which left their coach MacDonald Makhubedu angry with his players.
