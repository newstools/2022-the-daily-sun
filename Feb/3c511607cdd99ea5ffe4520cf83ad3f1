NOLUVUYO “Bubbly” Sodela is on a mission to rejuvenate women’s punanis. The 28-year-old former exotic dancer, who used to be on Generations: The Legacy, has taken her massage therapy business to the next level – doing beauty treatments on women’s punanis. Noluvuyo from Gqeberha said she started her business to have fun during the hard lockdown. “This time, I had to strip on digital platforms to put bread on the table for my family. As I always think out of the box, I shocked my fans one day by dying my pubic hair blonde,” Noluvuyo said. “That led to many fans messaging me to ask how to keep their punanis looking healthy like mine. “That’s how I got the idea to become a massage therapist. I got the qualification and never looked back. “I have helped many women soothe their punanis. Some come with shaved punanis that have ingrown hairs. “The treatment I do is known as a vajacial. The demand for it grew as some clients even travelled from as far as Cape Town.” A 32-year-old client from East London, who asked to remain anonymous, said she was happy with the treatment.
