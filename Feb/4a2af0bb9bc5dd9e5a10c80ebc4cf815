THE eighth season of popular telenovela Uzalo is coming back stronger. The telenovela, produced by Stained Glass TV, has recruited some of Mzansi’s top actors to join the show. And, Omuhle Gela is one of them. She will be playing the role of Nomaswazi, starting to appear in May. Insiders said during the cast photoshoot last Friday, Omuhle was at Uzalo studios. Confirming the news on social media, she said she was excited to have joined the show. “The cat is out of the bag, I see. I’m so excited to be joining the cast of South Africa’s number one soapie.” ALSO READ | KENNETH NKOSI TALKS DIVORCE Talented actor Siyabonga Radebe has also reportedly joined the show, making a comeback after disappearing from the screen for quite some time. Uzalo spokeswoman Nomfundo Zondi said Omuhle would be shaking things up. “Season 8 will come with some changes, but not a lot. Viewers will be stunned by the talent and drama,” said Nomfundo. Although Uzalo remains the number one show with biggest viewership in Mzansi, it has lost viewers since 2021. It pulled in record-breaking numbers in 2020, with 11 million viewers. But in December 2021, the numbers decreased to seven million. In an attempt to boost viewership, Uzalo returned old cast members including Khaya Dladla who played GC, Nokuthula Mabika (Thobile) and Ntokozo Dlamini (Mastermind). These actor didn’t stay for long, and they seem to have brought no influence in the ratings.
