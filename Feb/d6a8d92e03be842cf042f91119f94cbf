MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp has described their 2-1 defeat to Golden Arrows in their DStv Premiership Kwa-Zulu Natal derby at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday as “quite heavy to process”. Middendorp called his players “naive”, with the relegation axe hovering above them. The Team of Choice were looking for back-to-back wins for the second time this season after beating SuperSport United in their previous match. But it wasn’t the case as Arrows striker Knox Mutizwa netted a brace home while veteran defender Alfred Ndengane replied for United. The loss sees Maritzburg remain 12th on the Premiership table with 18 points, level with 13th placed Swallows and one ahead of 14th TS Galaxy and 15th Chippa United. “We were not on the field as a unit, in defence and attack,” said Middendorp. “We changed the setup at half-time and immediately we conceded a goal and that was quite naive. But after that we had better spacing and positioning. “We co-operated better, started to play, scored a goal (which was) fully deserved.” Arrows coach Lehlohonolo Seema, who worked with Middendorp at Bloemfontein Celtic, breathed a sigh of relief at his side’s victory. Seema said he was glad when the game finished because the home side were piling forward looking for the equaliser. Abafana Bes’Thende, who has dominated this fixture down the years, ended their struggles winning for the first time in seven outings in all competitions. “The win saw them remain 10th on the table with 25 points after 19 matches. “It was a game that I’m glad got finished,” said Seema, who was under immense pressure to turn things around. “When the game was nearing the end, every player from Maritzburg was on the attack and that gave us a problem. But I’m happy that the guys could resist and we managed to win the match.”
