A MAN who killed his girlfriend for failing to cook supper has been sentenced to 20 years in jail. Laorens Coetzee (41) was handed down the sentence by the Prieska Regional Court in the Northern Cape on Thursday, 27 January. According to Captain Olebogeng Tawana, during proceedings, the court heard that on 3 November 2017, the accused arrived at the residence where he stayed with his girlfriend. “He found that his girlfriend did not cook supper that evening. An argument ensued between the two and the accused severely assaulted his girlfriend. “He then fled the scene, leaving his girlfriend helpless. She later died as a result of the injuries,” Tawana said in a statement. Tawana said that the neighbour found the victim dead when they arrived at the scene. “Evidence presented in court was overwhelming, resulting in the successful prosecution of the accused. Coetzee was found guilty as charged on a count of murder,” Tawana said. District commander Brigadier Nomana Adonis applauded the investigating officer for working closely with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), as well as the justice department.
