WITHOUT any doubt, Mamelodi Sundowns again dominated the January PSL transfer window period. This time around, the Brazilians did not make as many signings as they would normally do, however, the two confirmed entrants during the period gave a clear impression about their intentions to continue their dominance in the DStv Premiership. Downs secured the services of hot property, Bradley “Surprise” Ralani from Cape Town City FC at the beginning of the year. In the last week of the transfer period, they again flexed their financial muscle when they secured the signature of Teboho Mokoena, in what is regarded as the biggest transfer locally, worth an estimated R23 million. The Brazilians beat Belgium giants Anderlecht FC, who were also eager to sign Mokoena. Other big teams locally, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, did not confirm any new signings, which left many fans puzzled. This might indicate that Sundowns will continue with their dominance in the second round of the campaign. Royal AM made an overhaul as they released 15 players.
