SIMPHIWE Shembe is at risk of losing his house. The comedian revealed to Daily Sun that the house, in an exclusive suburb of Durban, would be auctioned on 25 February if he did not pay the money he owed to the bank. In an effort to save his house after failing to pay monthly instalments, he wrote an email to the bank’s legal department pleading for mercy. He said the lockdown had reduced his income. Simphiwe said he had been living in the three-bedroom house since 2017. “My monthly instalment is R7 500 and I currently owe over R100 000. “Things started going downhill during lockdown. I had no income, and used all my savings and investments. “The only money I have is for food and day-to-day basics.” ALSO READ | LERATO MVELASE GOES BACK TO SCHOOL Simphiwe recently posted a video on social media, asking for donations from his fans. “My fans suggested a comedy show so they can buy tickets to save my house.
