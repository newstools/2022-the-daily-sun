A
67-year-old Ballito businessman has been identified as a R167 million Lotto
winner. The man won
in the PowerBall draw last Friday. According
to the man, who is an avid golfer, he plans to settle his debt, make several
investments and donate some of his winnings to charity. Besides
wanting to travel, he has no plans to make any drastic changes to his
lifestyle. He found
out he had won when checking his ticket numbers on the internet. Before
approaching the Ithuba regional office in Durban to claim his winnings on
Tuesday, he had only told his immediate family, and kept his ticket in a safe. "This
is the second-highest PowerBall jackpot win since February 2019 when we had a
R232 million winner. In July 2021, we also had a R158 million jackpot
winner," Ithuba CEO Charmaine Mabuza said. "With
this recent big PowerBall jackpot win, it shows that there are various ways
that tickets can be played through buying them at a retailer or playing through
one of our digital channels; players have the option of selecting numbers
manually or via quick-pick." SOURCE:
