FORMER Gomora actor Israel Matseke-Zulu, who is well known as GP-MaOrange, is in high spirits, despite losing a leg. Israel’s leg was amputated last year due to gangrene. He recently opened up to Daily Sun about his ordeal. He said he was happy he was no longer in pain. “After my operation in December, I was free and I was fine emotionally and mentally. Physically, the pain I felt in my leg was completely gone,” he said. “I sometimes even forget I no longer have two legs, that’s how well I have been. I’ve been attending physiotherapy sessions and I have two more to go. They said I’ve healed quickly.” Israel said the previous seven months were horrible. “I couldn’t sleep because of the pain I would feel in my leg. I consulted different doctors without getting help.

What was crazy and confusing is that gangrene usually affects people with diabetes and I didn’t have that.” Israel said he was in the process of getting a prosthetic leg. He thanked everyone who had given him love and support during a very difficult year. He said he was working on a number of projects, which would be coming soon.
