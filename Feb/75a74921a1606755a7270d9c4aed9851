ABC Motsepe League side Summerfield Dynamos pulled a giant-killing act when they eliminate GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi FC in the last-32 of the Nedbank Cup. Mcedi Vandala scored the only goal in the 23rd minute, in a 1-0 victory, which proved enough to book them a place in the last-16 of the tournament in a match at Princess Magogo Stadium on Friday afternoon. Summerfield, who are making their debut in the Ke Yona Cup, joins Mamelodi Sundowns, Orlando Pirates, University of Pretoria, Venda Football Academy, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandiala and SuperSport United, who have all reached the next round of the competition. Uthongathi coach Papi Zothwane admitted that his side did not bring their a game in the match, which resulted in them being eliminated.“I think it was a game of two halves, Summerfield had a good game in the first half. We did not do well and we conceded a stupid goal to say,” said disappointed Zothwane.“In the second half of the game, I told the players to show the Uthongathi we know and they did fight but it was not meant to be and I think they wanted it more than us.” Summerfield mentor Clinton Larsen said the victory would give them much needed motivation heading to their crucial Motsepe League on Wednesday,, where a win will see them winning their stream. Larsen told SuperSport TV: “We have important game on Wednesday if we win it that will means we have won out stream. This win is for the chairman and the people of Chatsworth.” “Gallant defending for us, we really defended well as a team. Reaching the last-16 is a dream come true for these players now. It is also a huge morale boost heading back to the league.”
