PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa led a delegation of government officials on a walkabout in the Cape Town City Hall to familiarise himself with the venue where he will tonight deliver the State of the Nation Address. The address was moved to the hall after the torching of parliament earlier this year. The alleged arsonist is currently in police custody and is facing a range of charges related to the incident. Ramaphosa was accompanied by National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and National Council of Provinces chair Amos Masondo and other officials during the walkabout in the hall. In a tightened security brief visit to the hall, the president was whisked inside the hall with the media contingent kept at an arm’s length. More dignitaries are expected to visit the hall to familiarise themselves with the set-up ahead of the address, which is scheduled for 7pm. The address will be held at the hall in the precinct where former president Nelson Mandela delivered his first speech upon his release from prison. Ironically, Ramaphosa was present at that occasion and held the mic for Mandela, who addressed the masses from the balcony of the Grand Parade in 1990. Even though the event will be held at the hall, it is expected to have all the glitz and glamour that often characterise the address with the red carpet where ministers and invited guests will showcase their fashion to the military 21 gun salute. Due to the limit of space in the venue, some ministers and guests are expected to take part in the occasion virtually, but the rest of Mzansi will see the president addressing the nation on television and other social media platforms from 7pm.
