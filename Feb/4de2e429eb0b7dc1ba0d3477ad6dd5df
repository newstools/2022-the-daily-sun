YOUNG entrepreneur Amos Baloyi has penned a Tsonga novel titled Bya Jika Vutomi Lebyi. It was published by Chaval Publishers. Amos is the founder and director of Kuhumelela Foundation, a motivational speaker and CEO of Baloyi Print Works. He is also studying towards a Bachelor of Administration in Local Government at the University of Limpopo. The 21-year-old from Jim Nghalalume Village in Giyani, Limpopo, told Daily Sun he had always dreamt of writing a book. “Bya Jika Vutomi Lebyi is not just a book, but a coach to help people deal with life’s ups and downs. It focuses on a young boy named Mikateko Ngomane. “During his upbringing, he came across many challenges and obstacles. However, he managed to conquer all due to his perseverance and determination to reach his dreams and goals,” said Amos. He said he had a message to share with the world. “It is so interesting you won’t put it down until you turn the last page. People will learn how Mikateko managed to overcome the challenges he was facing.” Amos said he was inspired by Isaac Saki Shabangu’s book, Swi Tlula Magandzelo. “I loved reading books by the age of 10. I would not go to bed before turning a few pages on Swi Tlula Magandzelo. It inspired me to start writing,” he said. Amos’ next book, The Key Steps to Achieve Success in Life, will be published later this year.
