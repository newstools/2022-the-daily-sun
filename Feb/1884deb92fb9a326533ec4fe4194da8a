THERE’S been a rise in young women using korobela and izangoma are concerned. Gobela Joseph Dungamanzi from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, said he was concerned because the women later grew tired of their men and wanted to reverse it. Joseph said he strongly discouraged women from using korobela on men as it had bad side affects. “The man gets sick as time goes by. He’ll go to doctors, who will tell him nothing is wrong with him,” he said. Joseph said he had turned away 10 women since the start of February. “I help ladies cleanse themselves so people can love them but I don’t give people korobela. I don’t like that,” he said. Gogo Mahlalentabeni, a sangoma from Joburg, said she had been getting more korobela requests in the past two years.  She said what concerned her was that the women were as young as 19. Sangoma Mkhulu Eric Mahlangu from Delmas in Mpumalanga said: “If it were older women, I would understand. I don’t understand why a 19-year-old would want to give a man korobela,” he said. A 20-year-old woman said she used korobela in January 2021 and in December, things ended badly with her boyfriend. “I think a friend suggested he visit a sangoma and whatever they did worked because he despises me now. “He dumped me and took everything he bought for me,” she said. The woman said she used korobela on her boyfriend because another woman wanted him and he was giving her attention. Simphiwe Mkhwanazi of Izangoma Pride Association also said he was strongly against the use of korobela.
