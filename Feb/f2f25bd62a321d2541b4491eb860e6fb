A SANGOMA was shot and wounded by unknown gunmen and left for dead in a pool of blood. It is alleged the men demanded the 59-year-old sangoma’s gun and started shooting at him inside his home in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Tuesday, 22 February at around 7pm before setting his ndumba on fire. The sangoma was rushed to hospital, but that was not the end of his ordeal. A source told Daily Sun the attackers drove to the hospital looking for the wounded sangoma. When they didn’t find him the fuming gunman and his accomplice were seen tussling with security guards as they pushed the sangoma’s car out of the hospital’s gates. “The gunman and his accomplice came in a white bakkie and entered the hospital,” he said. He said a few minutes later they came out and went straight to the sangoma’s car parked near the hospital building. “They pushed it out of the yard. When the security guards tried to stop them they threatened to kill them.” “The two men jumped into a bakkie parked outside the hospital and drove off,” he said. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule confirmed that a patient was brought to the hospital with gunshot wounds on Tuesday, doctors attended to him and he was transferred the following day. “The security guards saw the car burning outside the hospital and saw two men running from it and got into a white bakkie with no registration numbers. The men never entered the hospital,” said Malamule. Captain Gugu Phiri said a case of attempted murder, malicious damage to property and arson has been opened.
