THE Zion Christian Church (ZCC) has distanced itself from the ritual that led to the deaths of five men at a dam last month. In a statement, the church said it had noted, with concern and horror, the reports about the tragic incident that happened at a dam in Eersterus in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. ZCC said according to reports, it appeared they were members of the church as a photo showed one of them dressed in its clothes. It offered condolences to the bereaved families.

The church warned and reminded members that in response to the declaration of the state of disaster last March, it stopped all activities. “ZCC and the church council confirm that there is no rituals that need to be performed at a dam, river or mountain in the name of the church.” It said ZCC distanced itself from the event, and should not be associated with activities that led to the tragic loss of life. “The church is disappointed that despite its teachings, some members persist in visiting rivers, dams and mountains contrary to its policies and rules. “Members are advised to desist from dangerous conduct that exposes them to risk.” Daily Sun reported on its website on 16 January that the dead went to the dam around midnight to perform rituals when the incident happened. Colonel Dimakatso Sello said cops have opened an inquest docket after Calvin Kagiso Baloyi (31), Karabo Vincent Phahla (30), Peter Thabo Mahlangu (51), Thabo Mogoroe (47) and Pontsho Ernest Khutwane (42) were swept away by water while allegedly performing rituals
