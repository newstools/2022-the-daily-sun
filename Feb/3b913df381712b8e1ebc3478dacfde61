A FATHER has been arrested for allegedly raping his daughter. Eastern Cape police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said cops responded to a complaint of rape in the Ntsimbini area of Port St Johns at about 10am on Thursday, 3 February. He said when police arrived on the scene, residents had made a citizen’s arrest of a 27-year-old man accused of raping his daughter, who is almost two years old. The child was rushed to hospital, but later died. “The suspect was detained on a case of rape and an additional charge of murder,” he said. The suspect was set to appear in the Lusikisiki Magistrates Court on Monday, 7 February. Petros Majola from the Khula Community Development Project said women who arrived on the scene first said the child was severely injured. “He damaged his child very badly and she was rushed to hospital but sadly, the poor child died,” he said. Petros said men needed to stop abusing women and children. “I do not know what needs to be said or done for men to stop killing and raping women and children. This father was supposed to protect his daughter but instead, he did the worst thing to her,” he said. Petros said the suspect deserved to rot in jail. “We are hoping our justice system will do right by this baby. That man doesn’t deserve to live among humans because what he did was evil,” he said. A resident said they wished they could have taken the law into their own hands. “We should have beaten him badly or cut off his private part because he doesn’t know how to use it,” said the resident. “I have never seen anything like that. There was no way that child could have survived because he damaged her so badly. You would have sworn an animal tore her skin off.”
