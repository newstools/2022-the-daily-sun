STELLENBOSCH FC are gradually losing their grip at the top of the DStv Premiership log table. And coach Steve Barker has reason to be aggrieved with his players who committed a hideous flop midweek, dropping two points in a last minute gasp. Actually, he believes they had already roasted Swallows FC whom they led for the better part of the game, only for a repulsive booboo to see them draw 1-1. The Stellies coach believes they could have defended Zitha Kwinika’s 10th minute goal with their lives, which could have been of benefit for them on the log. But Wandisile Letlabika got the better of them, pounced from the nest and hit what ended as an equaliser. “I am obviously disappointed,” declared Barker who thought to concede at the death was their morale destroyer. “The two points slipped across. It is an area that we have to be better.” But, like any good manager, he had to find a way to motivate his players with a positive spin towards his anger by claiming a point gained isn’t as bad as losing them all. The Stellies remains within the top three on the log with 30 points from 19 games. “There has been definite progress in the team, in terms of our performances,” he said, however, “it is just that little bit of a 5-10%” that they have to improve. “Look at the log table, we have now drawn nine matches, if you convert one or two of those into wins, then it becomes just a different ballgame (on the log).”
