A
Vanderbijlpark police officer was arrested for drunk driving after allegedly
driving into a cyclist, killing him, and driving away without stopping, the
Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) said on Sunday. IPID
spokesperson Grace Langa said a motorist on the R59 driving towards
Vanderbijlpark noticed a police van zig-zagging along the road and driving
recklessly. The
officer took an off-ramp, and at the corner of Andries Potgieter and Play
Boulevard streets, the police vehicle drove through a red robot. Langa
added the motorist was worried the police officer might cause an accident and
asked him to stop his vehicle. "He
then got out of his car and asked the police officer to give him his car keys
so he can drive him to the nearest police station. "The
police officer refused to give him the car keys and immediately drove off. As
he was driving, the car hit an unknown male who was riding a bicycle," she
said. The
policeman did not stop, and the other driver followed him and reported the
accident to the police. Officers
from Vanderbijlpark eventually stopped their colleague at the Curie Boulevard
stop street. The
27-year-old police officer was arrested for drunk driving. A case
of culpable homicide will also be investigated. SOURCE:
