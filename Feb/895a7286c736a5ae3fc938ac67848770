THEY say practise makes perfect and repetition also builds perfection. Simply put, doing the same thing over and over again builds consistency and one becomes a master of their respective craft. Take washing your teeth as an example. Many of us do it daily but according to many dentists, many of us are doing this incorrectly. According to Health-line magazine, this is caused by the toothpastes and toothbrushes we use. According to the publication, the act of flossing and the overall dental care is something we are not practising correctly. So how does one brush their teeth properly? Health-line magazine gives us a step-by-step guide: 1. Lubricate your toothbrush with a small amount of water One should put a small amount (pea-size) of toothpaste on the tip of the toothbrush. 2. Insert your toothbrush into your mouth At about 45-degree angle, insert the toothbrush inside your mouth and gums and begin to gently draw circular strokes inside your mouth to brush your teeth. 3. Brush the inside surface of your teeth When doing this, make sure your toothbrush reaches the back molars and upper areas of your chewing surfaces. 4. Flip the toothbrush upside down To get to the inside surface of your top front teeth. Flip it back around to get the inside surface of your bottom front teeth. 5. Brush your tongue A lot of the mouth’s bacteria lives in the human tongue and in order to avoid the building of the bacteria and plaque. Brush your tongue as well to also keep it fresh and clean. 6. Rinse your mouth After doing all this in an estimated time of two minutes, spit out the saliva and rinse your mouth with cold water.
