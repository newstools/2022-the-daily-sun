MORE than 20 families lost everything in a fire on Monday, 31 January. Vuyelwa Sithelo (58) from Langa, Cape Town, told Daily Sun the fire started at the back of her house and her shack was the first to be gutted. She said she woke up coughing and realised she was being choked by smoke. She went to open the back door and grabbed her two grandchildren but she couldn’t save anything else. “I’m glad I’m alive but the fire left me with a heartache as I could not save my sewing machine, which I was using for my small business,” she said. Vuyelwa said she worked as a tailor and was making masks. She said she lost all her equipment and material she recently bought to sew masks.  “I don’t know how to start again because this was my bread and butter. The fire was fierce and the dark smoke stopped me from taking anything from the house,” she said. Her neighbour Mzimasi Booi (46) said most people bought masks from Vuyelwa as she was selling them at a lower price. “When you were in a hurry and cannot find your mask, you just rush to her house and get one for R5. I lost everything in the fire too but I’m so hurt that she lost her business,” he said. Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Jermaine Carelse said crews from Goodwood, Epping, Milnerton, Belhar, Salt River and Gugulethu were on the scene. “A total of eight firefighting appliances and 35 firefighters battled the blaze. The fire was extinguished at 2.33am and no injuries or fatalities were reported,” said Carelse.
