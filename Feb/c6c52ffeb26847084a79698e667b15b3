FINALLY, a frustrating period for Sekhukhune United defender, Sello Motsepe will be put to bed when the team returns to competitive action in the Nedbank Cup Round of 32 against Platinum City Rovers at Olen Park Stadium on Saturday (3:00 pm). Babina Noko has not played a competitive match in almost two months due to the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) which came into conclusion last Sunday in Cameroon. Motsepe said it has been frustrating not to play for that long. He said: “We haven’t been playing for almost five weeks and it is frustrating not playing official games but we have been preparing well for the game against platinum city rovers.” He’s convinced that his team is well prepared for the match on Saturday against GladAfrica Championship team Rovers. “We've been playing friendly matches during this period. So, I think we have been preparing very well, we are very much prepared,” he said. He added they played two friendly matches against Rovers during the break and they have a bit of inside information about their opponents. “Rovers are in the Championship and we played against them twice in the friendly matches so we have a bit of an inside about who they are and I think it’s going to be a good game with two teams familiar with each other,” he said. He promised the fans they going to give their all in the match.
