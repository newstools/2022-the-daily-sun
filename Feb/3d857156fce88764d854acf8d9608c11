POLICE in Samora Machel, Cape Town, are investigating a case of murder after the body of a woman was found with stabbed wounds on Tuesday, 22 February. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said Samora Machel cops responded to a complaint around 8am. “Upon arrival, they found the body of an unknown woman in between the shacks, who had sustained stab wounds to her body,” said Swartbooi. The 32-year-old victim was declared dead on the scene by medical personnel, and the motive for the attack is unknown. “The suspect/s are yet to be arrested,” said Swartbooi. However, a resident said she heard people saying the woman was heard fighting with a man. “I don’t know when the fight stopped, but people found bloodstains in the morning. “They followed the bloodstains until they found the body with stab wounds,” said the resident. Community policing forum member Bongani Maqungwana said the incident left everyone reeling in shock. “We are working hard to curb crime in our community, including the abuse and killing of women and children. We thought we were doing well, but this shows we have a long way to go,” he said. Maqungwana said they had an outreach programme in November and December, where they were speaking about women and children abuse. “There is a lot we still have to do. Enough is enough. We need men to come forward and protect women and children,” said Maqungwana. Anyone with information is urged to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
