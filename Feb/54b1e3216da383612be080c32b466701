POST offices in Mzansi have become easy targets for thugs. This comes after another one in Wesselsbron, Free State, was robbed by three armed suspects wearing masks on Thursday, 3 February. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said a car with a Botswana registration number was seen speeding off from the scene. “At 7.45am, a manager at Wesselsbron Post Office was with two employees and a security officer when they were forced into the back offices of the premises. “They were tied up at gunpoint. The manager was forced to open the safe, where an undisclosed amount of cash was robbed,” Thakeng said. He said the three suspects were seen driving off in a white Toyota Camry, driven by a mlungu. “A case of armed robbery has been registered for further investigation,” he said.
