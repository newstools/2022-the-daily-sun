A HEAVY storm on Thursday, 17 February destroyed shacks in Jeffesville in Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane, leaving many people homeless. According to the affected residents, they don’t have money to rebuild their homes. But some residents used the same damaged material to rebuild their shacks. Eunice Pangula (55) said her shack was swept away by heavy winds which left zinc sheets and her belongings scattered all over the place. She said her furniture was also destroyed by the rain. “I don’t have money to buy new building material. The only way to rebuild my home is to use the broken material and put them together as I don’t have a place to go,” she said. Klaas Magoleng (31) said the storm left him poorer as he didn’t only lose his shack, but all his furniture and other belongings. “Thank God, for protecting me as I am still alive,” he said. Sam Nkosi (35) said his shack, a bed, wardrobe, cupboard and other belongings were destroyed. He said the storm left the community in pain. “We appeal for help as our shacks and belongings were destroyed,” he said. City of Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman Deputy Chief Charles Mabaso said a storm left a number of informal residents in Jeffesville without homes. He said about 15 shacks were destroyed by the storm. “Emergency Services were notified at night about the incident, disaster management was activated and officials issued emergency relief in the form of blankets and mattress to those affected,” he said. Mabaso said social development and disaster management officials were engaged in an assessment conducted in conjunction with community leaders and the local councillor.
