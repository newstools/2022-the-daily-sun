 Russian forces resumed bombing Ukraine in the early hours of Friday morning, with explosions rocking central Kyiv. This happened after President Vladimir Putin ordered an attack aimed at collapsing the government. Ukrainian news service Liga.net reports that Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced that three people were injured, one critically, when a rocket hit a residential building in the city. It's reported that the building is on fire and could collapse. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed to remain in Kyiv as his troops fought Russian invaders advancing toward the capital in the largest attack on a European state since World War II. Reuters reports that following President Vladimir Putin's declaration of war, Russia launched an invasion by land, air, and sea on Thursday. An estimated 100 000 people fled as major cities were rocked by explosions and gunfire. Dozens of people have been killed, according to reports. CNN reports that according to a Ukrainian government adviser, the
Ukrainian capital Kyiv was targeted with missile fire before dawn Friday, as
