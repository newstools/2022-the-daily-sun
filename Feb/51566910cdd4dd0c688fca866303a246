TOYOTA has been a people’s mover for decades, and the taxi industry relies on its Quantum to move the masses. Now if you love the Quantum but are scared of taxi drivers and operators, what do you do? The answer: make it loud and look like a Lamborghini. A Toyota Quantum has been listed on Instagram page CarcandyINC as for sale for a whopping R1 million. According to the post, it is a 2012 Toyota Quantum V12 Twin Turbo, inspired by the Lamborghini Aventador.  The taxi has been modified with an imported kit from Japan, a mid-mounted Toyota V12 5.0 engine (1GZ-FE), and two Billet T3/T4 twin-scroll turbos now call this home. “Fitting the engine mid-mounted was not as easy as it seems, as the body had to be seriously strengthened and strong sub-frames fabricated. A bespoke intake was designed and fabricated, incorporating 12 individual trumpets. Twelve Porsche 997 3.8 Carerra Bosch 350cc injectors are used. A Maxx ECU is installed and to cool the intake air, two large water-to-air charge cooler is used. On the last run using an octane booster, we made 442Kw with 710Nm,” the post read.

It has a modified torque converter that increases the stall rate to 2 800rpm. The post states that this set-up works well because of the high stall speed converter that allows you to rev up the motor before launch. And, this allows the turbos to spool up, giving a strong pull off when needed. If you pull off normally, the turbos hardly spool up, so you use the power as if you are driving a normally aspirated 5.0 V12 – so no drama, just a gentle cruise. The power is transferred to a Ford GT Mustang differential with a limited-slip. Audi R8 wheels that were widened at the back help keep the power to the road.
