THANKS to a heroic Uber driver and residents, a hijacker was caught on Friday, 18 February. The driver had stopped at a traffic light in Motsu Section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, when he saw two thugs pointing a gun at a Nissan NP200 in front of him. The driver then told the victim to get into his car and they chased after the hijackers. When residents heard the driver and the victim shouting “vimba!”, they blocked the road with rocks so the hijackers couldn’t pass. One thug was caught while the other, who had the gun, managed to escape. Residents beat up the thug, who later died. Constable Patricia Mgijima said the hijacked car belonged to the victim’s employer. She said hijackers approached the 43-year-old while he was at a traffic light and ordered him to move to the passenger’s side. But he managed to escape. “The community came in numbers but one suspect got away. The other suspect, aged 43, couldn’t outrun them.” Mgijima said by the time police arrived, the suspect was already dead. A murder case was opened. “Police urge the community not to take the law into their own hands,” she said, urging anyone with information to contact Tembisa police on 011 920 8000.
