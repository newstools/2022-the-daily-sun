THE teenager, Mpho Tjale whose 4-5 was found mutilated at the mortuary, will be laid to rest on Sunday, 27 February. His family told Daily Sun the body that was held at the government mortuary pending investigations, was released to them on Wednesday, 23 February. Mpho (18) was meant to have been buried last Sunday, 20 February but his family refused to take his body after discovering that his penis had been tempered with. His parents, Portia (39) and Billium Tjale (48), said Mpho’s body was collected from their house by the first funeral parlour in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, which took their son’s body to a second funeral parlour also in Daveyton for storage. They discovered at the second parlour that the 4-5 had been tempered with. They called the People’s Paper. When the SunTeam arrived, it found angry community members sitting under a tent saying no funeral would take place until police investigates. “My son deserves to be buried with dignity, not with some of his body parts missing. We thank the community for being with us during this difficult time. All we want is justice for our son,” said Portia.
