GAUTENG Judge President Dunstan Mlambo has denied that he has a soft spot for President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said it was unfortunate that some people saw him as being in favour of the president. Commissioner Advocate Griffiths Madonsela SC said there was an undercurrent that Mlambo ruled favourably on all cases involving Ramaphosa, while those involving former president Jacob Zuma went against him. Mlambo said: “Facts are facts in each case and it has nothing to do with who the parties are. It’s a question of applying the law to facts. I have no soft spot for Ramaphosa. And, I have nothing against Zuma.” He said that the generalisation was unfair. “I deny it. That’s not how I operate,” he said. However, he said people were free to make their own opinions. Mlambo explained why his court set aside Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s remedial action on Ramaphosa’s CR17 presidential campaign, while it upheld Thuli Madonsela’s on the Nkandla report that the chief justice must appoint a judge to chair the State Capture Commission. He said Madonsela was entitled to do so, given that Zuma was so deeply implicated and it called for an extraordinary measure to ensure that remedial action was seen through. In the second case, Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa had benefitted personally from the campaign funding and ordered the speaker to subject him to an ethics investigation. “There was no evidence that justified the remedial action whatsoever,” he said. He dispelled sexual harassment rumours against him, saying they were aimed at denting his candidature. “It’s an insidious poisonous rumour. I know as I sit here, I have never sexually harassed anyone. I feel pained that this rumour has found its way to my interview.”
