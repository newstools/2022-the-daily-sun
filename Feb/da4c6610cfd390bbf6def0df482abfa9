TWO suspects were bust on Wednesday, 23 February, while loading allegedly stolen cooking oil onto a truck. They’re accused of hijacking a truck transporting expensive cooking oil in Bedfordview, Ekurhuleni, earlier. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said cops received a tip-off that two foreign nationals were loading buckets of oil onto a truck in nearby Springs. They were immediately arrested. “We understand this consignment was destined to go to Makro wholesalers when the incident happened,” he said. “At this stage, we don’t know what happened to the hijacked truck and police are investigating.” Police said the Crispa Gold oil was believed to be worth thousands of rands. Cops are looking for a third suspect, also a foreign national, believed to be the boss of the two arrested men. Ramphora said this came not long after stolen goods were found at the same storage facility where the men were bust. Several weeks previously, two brand new grader machines were found and two men were arrested. “Police are going to leave no stone unturned to fight crime in our precinct,” he said. The two suspects were expected to appear in court soon.
