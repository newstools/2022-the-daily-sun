MORE than 200 people from the Walking Bus project around various kasis in Cape Town have clashed with cops outside the barricades at the Grand Parade where the State of the Nation Address (Sona) is expected to be held tonight, 10 February. Walking Bus is an initiative of communities which protects kids when going to school. The group that had gathered close to the road, that dignitaries of the Sona are using to access the venue, where told to move and gather somewhere else, far from the venue. The spokeswoman of the group, Vanessa Adriaanse, said all they wanted was to be addressed by the president or a minister. “We are not here to fight. We are here to have our problems addressed. We are taking care of our children every day and we want to have a stipend for what we do,” said Adriaanse.  The group was later moved by a group of cops who pushed them away towards the direction of the Golden Arrow buses. Zizipho Mtotywa (34) from Mfuleni said the previous mayor of Cape Town, Dan Plato, used to give the parents stipends. The initiative is meant to ensure kids are safe when they go to school. Mpho Buntse (32) from an organisation called Access Chapter 2 said he was at the protest to call on President Cyril Ramaphosa to sign into law the Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill. “It is one of the longest sitting bills in parliament without consideration. Secondly between 2021 and 2022, we have reported 25 brutal murders of members of the LGBTQI community,” he said. He said Mzansi was regarded as a country with the most progressive laws but the LGBTQI+ members were living in fear.
