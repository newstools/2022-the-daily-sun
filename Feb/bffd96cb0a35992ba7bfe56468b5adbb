THE electric cables were hanging in the air and could drop on anyone at any time. But on Tuesday, 22 February, City Power arrived unannounced and disconnected the deadly cables leading from transformers to houses and businesses. During the operation in Kanana squatter camp in Rabie Ridge near Midrand, Joburg, huge bundles of cables were removed. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said not only was the municipality losing millions of rands to illegal connections but people were electrocuted and killed. “We removed about R5 million worth of cables illegally connected in Kanana weighing about 2000kg,” he said.  But residents were not happy and some said they would just reconnect. One resident said: “We don’t do illegal connections because we just choose to. We need electricity to make our lives easier.” Residents were furious and police had to intervene. One resident threatened to bomb the local power station so no one would have electricity. Residents of neighbouring Friendship Town Estate said the illegal connections meant their power went off all the time. They said it was unfair they paid for residents of the squatter camp to get power for free.
