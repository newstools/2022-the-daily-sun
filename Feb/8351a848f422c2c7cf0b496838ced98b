THE City of Cape Town’s Health Department has recorded a significant drop in the use of condoms, with a correlating rise in the number of sexually transmitted infections (STI). February is STI Condom Month and people are encouraged to take charge of their reproductive well-being. MMC for Community Services and Health Patricia van der Ross said the use of male condoms had nearly halved. In contrast, the use of female condoms is just more than a third of the previous year – the second consecutive year to show a decline. “The decline is concerning, especially when coupled with the rise in STIs. “I challenge both men and women to take the necessary precautions regarding their reproductive well-being,” said Van der Ross. The use of condoms dropped from 30,6 million in the 2019/2020 financial year to 16 085 200 during the 2020/2021 financial year. The use of female condoms dropped from 954 599 to 34 203, which could partially be attributed to people staying at home as per health directives and fewer visits to clinics. “Most infections can be cured. Reluctance to seek treatment because of the fear of stigma is one of many reasons many wait until it’s too late, of which can be life-threatening,” said the MMC
