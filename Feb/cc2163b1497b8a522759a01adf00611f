MANDISA Maya will be Mzansi’s first female chief justice if the Justice Service Commission’s wishes are realised. But it’s up to President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint a chief justice after the commission interviewed four candidates. The commission recommended Maya should be handed the job and will in the next few days deliver its report to Ramaphosa. Speaking ton Saturday, 5 February, commission spokesman Advocate Dali Mpofu said the president held the authority to appoint the chief justice. However, Ramaphosa will consult all political parties represented in parliament before making the decision. Mpofu said deliberations on the recommendations took longer than anticipated and this was due to the fact that for first time ever, four candidates were recommended by the president. “But what made our task difficult was that the candidates were all of a high quality. The uniqueness of the process was also unprecedented insofar as the president nominated more than one candidate for the first time ever to be interviewed by the Judicial Service Commission.” Mpofu said the commission would not impose any time-frame on the president regarding making the announcement. The public interviews drew mixed reactions. As the only and first female candidate to be interviewed, Maya called out those who labelled her a woman candidate and said she wanted to be seen as a judge as she wasn’t there on a woman judge ticket. Historically, presidents have gone against the commission’s recommendations and Maya had been in this situation before. In 2012, she was interviewed for a Constitutional Court position together with Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. She was recommended, but Zondo was appointed instead. Maya’s now up against Zondo, Dunstan Mlambo and Mbuyiseli Madlanga.
