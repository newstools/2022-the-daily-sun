SEKHUKHUNE United head coach, MacDonald Makhubedu is convinced that his team did everything except scoring in a 1-0 defeat at home to Moroka Swallows at Ellis Park Stadium on Saturday. Talking after the match Makhubedu said he was happy with the performance of the team and he admitted that they wouldn’t score even if they played that match longer than 90 minutes. “We did everything right but we couldn't score today. We could’ve played for three days, we were not going to score but I'm happy with the performance,” he said. He believed that Swallows head coach, Dylan Kerr analyzed them well. “They sat back with four the whole game and we saw their captain telling the bench to bring the third Centre-back so that they can be six at the back which was good leadership from him,” he said. He said they made life difficult for his team with the experienced players they have. The Dube Birds have gone above Chippa United and TS Galaxy to 13 on the log with 18 points after 21 games. They have played more games than TS Galaxy who have played 19 matches. The victory means that the Dube Birds were able to fly away from their six games winning less run in the DStv Premiership dating back from the first week of December 2021.
