THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) Disciplinary Committee have found Golden Arrows guilty of improper registration of a player. The case relates to midfielder Simo Mbhele, who was not given international clearance by the fourth-tier Portuguese outfit Sociedade Uniao Dezembro before returning to Arrows. Abafana Bes'thende are now likely to be docked nine points, which is the number of points they accumulated in the six matches Mbhele took to the field. That would see Lehlohonolo Seema's fall from tenth into the relegation zone as things stand. Although PSL prosecutor Zola Majavu did confirm that the Lamontville-based side did not knowingly field the ineligible Mbhele, they would still be held culpable for the 23-year-old's improper registration. "With regards to the allegations of dishonesty in pertaining to how Simo Mbhele's registration was procured, the PSL DC has found Golden Arrows and Simo Mbhele not guilty," Majavu said. "However, the DC deemed the actual registration of Mbhele to be improper and therefore both Golden Arrows and Simo Mbhele were found guilty and will be sanctioned appropriately on the 15th of February," explained Majavu. Majavu recently took over from Nande Becker as the new PSL prosecutor. -TeamTalk Media
