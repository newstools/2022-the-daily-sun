THE mother of a boy who was knocked down and killed allegedly by a speeding cop is devastated. Nomakorinte Frans (42) from Zwezwe, Khayelitsha said it was even worse when she went to identify her son’s body at Tygerberg mortuary. She described how her son, Bakwena (16) looked. “He didn’t look like he is dead. There was no blood. I’m devastated,” she said. Three boys were knocked down by a cop vehicle which was allegedly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car on Old Faure Road near Mfuleni on Monday, 25 July. Two of the boys died, while one was admitted to hospital. Bakwena’s aunt, Talitha (32), said: “Our culture requires them to come over to apologise for what they did. “So far, not even a single cop has come to talk to us and apologise.” Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident. He said two teenage boys were killed and one seriously hurt, and investigations were continuing.
