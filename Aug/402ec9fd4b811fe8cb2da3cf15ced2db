ROADBLOCKS are being conducted in different parts of Joburg. Following the death of Metro officer Vongani Hlungwane, who was shot and killed in Joubert Park, Joburg last Friday during a shoot-out with suspects, MMC for safety David Tembe called for roadside checks in the streets of Joburg for illegal firearms on Monday, 1 August. They conducted 66-point roadside check operations in areas such as Soweto, the Joburg CBD and Alexandra. The operation was held simultaneously to stop vehicles and frisk occupants on roads which are interlinked, in an effort to recover illegal firearms, illegal drugs, stolen goods and recovering stolen vehicles as well as to suspects. One suspect was arrested for possession of unlicensed firearm in Roodepoort at about 10pm on Monday. Meanwhile, three men were but for attempted robbery following a complaint at local tavern in Roodepoort. The City of Joburg’s ambassador for public safety, Wayne Minnaar, said the searches have been a success. “The JMPD operations have been a huge success since they started on 28 July for a 22-point deployment plan in Alexandra, where 44 officers were on duty. Now the 22-point plan is covering all regions in Joburg. “The operation will continue, particularly to curb crime, arrest suspects and recover illegal firearms in the wake of mass shootings in Joburg. “We also conducted a search in Orange Farm last Thursday. Four R1 magazines were recovered along with 561 R1 rounds. One suspect was also arrested,” added Minnaar.
