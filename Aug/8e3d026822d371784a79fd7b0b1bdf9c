TOP taxi drivers were awarded on Thursday, 28 July. Western Cape mobility MEC Daylin Mitchell recognised drivers, who are part of the Blue Dot programme, who got the most points from passengers. The programme gives taxi drivers the opportunity to transport workers, who rate their driving and whether they follow the rules of the road. The winning drivers were voted for by passengers over the previous year. “After a concerted effort, we are seeing encouraging evidence of positive behaviour change. The average number of speeding events by participating taxis has declined by 50%,” said Mitchell. Cape Organisation for the Democratic Taxi Association’s spokesman Andile Khanyi said for many years, taxi drivers were seen as bad drivers but the awards showed this was not the case. “As for Codeta, our winner is also a woman, Mama Chulekazi Maweyi, and we’re proud,” Khanyi said. Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association’s spokesman Nkululeko Sityebi said the programme was a positive development.
