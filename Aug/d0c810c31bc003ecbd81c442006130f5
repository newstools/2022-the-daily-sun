RED hot striker Tiklas “Castro” Thutlwa said he’s happy at Black Leopards and there is no rush for him to leave for a DStv Premiership side. Thutlwa told SunSport that he needs to stay with the Motsepe Foundation Championship outfit to gain more experience and improve as a player than making a decision that could destroy his career. The 23-year-old, who ended last season as the Championship’s leading goal scorer with 16 goals in 29 league matches, has been linked with a move to Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United. Thutlwa played a key role in helping Leopards survive relegation last season. But with the transfer window still open, it remains to be seen if Leopards will be tempted to sell their star. Thutlwa was keen to play in the top flight but now he has changed his mind.“I am happy at Leopards and I want to continue to grow with this club,” he said. “I was excited about a move to the Premiership, but sometimes you need to look at what is best for your career. I think all I have to do now is to continue working hard and improve my game. It’s important to grow as a player and not to make rash decisions.” The Lephalale-born star is also optimistic about continuing with his form from the last campaign and helping the Venda-based side return to the top flight. “My goal is to do better than last season when it comes to my form and scoring goals,” he added. “My other goal is to ensure Leopards win promotion to the Premiership. “Last season, I think we got our form at a late stage of the season and it became tough for us as we were playing to help the team move from the danger zone. I am confident of fighting for promotion because we retained most of the key players and the coach we had last season. The aim is to continue working hard and maintain that good form.”
