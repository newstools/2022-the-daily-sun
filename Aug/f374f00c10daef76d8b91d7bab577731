CONGREGANTS were deep into a prayer session at about 2am when heavily armed men attacked them at their church Bekkersdal. According to the church members, one person died after he was shot. Others were left injured following the robbery and hostage situation, which took place on Saturday, 30 July. Speaking to Daily Sun, some of the members said that eight armed men burst into their church and held them hostage for about 15 minutes. “It seemed like a horror movie. They beat us up and took our phones,” said one member. “You could just see that they were enjoying beating us up, kicking us and laughing while at it,” she said. Another member said she thought she’d die because a few days ago she dreamt about a certain church being broken into by a group of men but they didn’t find anyone in that church. “So when this happened right in front of my eyes, I immediately remembered that dream and I thought this is probably how I’ll die,” said the member. Another congregant, Fumani Manyaka (33), told Daily Sun she couldn’t even close her eyes at night because whenever she tried, a picture of those guys kicking them and pointing guns at them comes to mind. “I’m done with church and I don’t want anyone to convince me otherwise,” she said. Xolani Mngadi (26) said he won’t go to church anytime soon because they were attacked at a place where they should be safe or protected. “I don’t know how God allows people to attack us at our place of worship. I don’t think I’ll recover anytime soon,” he said. The pastor was unavailable to talk to the SunTeam. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo said police are searching for the suspects and opened a case of murder and business robbery
