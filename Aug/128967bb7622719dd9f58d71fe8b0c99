PARTS of Tembisa in Ekurhuleni are no-go areas. This comes after angry residents barricaded the ever-busy roads of the township with rocks in the early hours of Monday morning, 1 August. According to Eyewitness News, the residents took to the streets to voice out their grievances over electricity and high rates. There are also reports that Ekurhuleni Mayor Tania Campbell failed to honour her promised visit to the residents on Friday, 29 July.  The angry residents have since vowed to shut down parts of the city until the mayor visits the area. EMPD spokesman Kelebogile Thepa told Newzroom Afrika that they tried to clear some of the roads. “We do confirm that we, as EMPD, are working tirelessly towards opening all major routes so that traffic can resume flowing,” said Thepa. Videos of the protest have since been shared on social media, with some roads closed using mobile toilets and rocks.
