MUNICIPAL officials recently rolled up their sleeves to help fix blocked stormwater drains. The City of Ekurhuleni officials also patched potholes as part of the back to basics service delivery campaign, led by Mayor Tania Campbell in Pomona, near Kempton Park`. Heavy trucks travelling in residential areas and the recent flash floods were identified as the main contributors to the damage to the city’s roads and stormwater system. Campbell said she planned to convene an urgent meeting with industry leaders who operated in the Pomona area close to residential areas to discuss and find lasting solutions. She said they would also look into the idea of using alternative routes to access their properties, as opposed to driving through residential areas, avoiding further damage to streets that were not designed for heavy-duty trucks. “If you’re part of the problem, please work with us to be part of the solution. We need to work together with the community to reach our goal, which is for the area to be safe for everyone,” said Campbell. Campbell also pleaded with residents of Pomona to refrain from illegally dumping of waste as that contributed to the blockage of the stormwater drainage system, resulting in flash floods during heavy rains. “Our officials are out and about rehabilitating the stormwater drainage systems in “We, therefore, request residents not to dump waste or foreign objects in the system to avoid blockages,” she said.
