ONE person has reportedly been shot and killed in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, as residents embarked on a violent protest over high rates and taxes on Monday morning, 1 August. The angry protesters barricaded major roads with stones and burning tyres. A truck was torched on the R21 highway as well as a power substation and a municipal office. Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) spokeswoman Chief Superintendent Kelebogile Thepa said they needed the deployment of the South African Police Service (SAPS) to manage the situation. Rubber bullets were used to disperse the crowd that was throwing stones at the police.  ALSO WATCH: TEMBISA SHUTDOWN: Angry residents take to streets! According to residents, the man was shot allegedly by EMPD officers. Thepa confirmed that a male African was fatally wounded as the result of the protest action.  She said:  "Investigations are currently underway to establish whether the victim was shot by one of our members and we cannot make any speculations.  "Several cars and municipal offices have also been torched. We urge motorists to drive with caution.  "This is a devastating scenario and the situation is extremely volatile. We are engaging with other law enforcements to come and assist us in containing the situation," added Thepa. Angry residents have accused Ekurhuleni Mayor Tania Campbell of undermining them. This comes after Campbell failed to pitch to a community meeting on Friday, 29 July, to give feedback on their memorandum of demands. Motorists are urged to avoid major roads around the kasi and use alternative routes. Resident Dorcas Malatji said: “We are protesting today because the mayor is not taking our demands seriously and failed to meet with us on Friday as she had promised. Tembisa is getting punished for the sins of others. Our electricity rates are overpriced and we are still expected to pay for water as well. We will not stop until we are heard.”
