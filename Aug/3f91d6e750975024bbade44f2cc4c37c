WELL-KNOWN Khayelitsha activist Fikile Mbambi was left homeless after a group of residents demolished his shack and looted his belongings. Fikile, who advocates for community safety, said he heard a group of people singing at night approaching his shack in the newly-formed New Culture squatter camp near False Bay College, Khayelitsha on 17 July. He took cover in the dark as the group destroyed his shack and took his bed, blankets and everything inside. He told Daily Sun he heard that people were spreading rumours that he had a gun and a bomb. He said he had called cops who raided local shebeens and that angered some of the people, who sell booze in the area. Fikile said he went to the cop shop at Lingelethu, but they allegedly refused to help him and he had to go to Cape Town Central for help. His neighbours said they were shocked to see people breaking down his shack. “Bro Fix stood up against shebeens that do not close on time,” said a neighbour. Sanco chairman in the area, Mziwakhe Gqawuza, said they received a petition from the residents accusing Fikile of tormenting them. “Fikile had many people arrested. That’s why people demolished his shack,” said Mziwakhe. He distanced Sanco from the incident, saying they were still trying to find ways to address the matter. Police spokesman Frederick van Wyk said: “To our knowledge, the complainant has never been to Lingelethu-West Police Station. “The complainant is currently a suspect in a defamation of character investigation, and would therefore not visit this station. “Scanned copies of the docket for malicious damage to property was received from Cape Town Central police and will receive the necessary attention.”
