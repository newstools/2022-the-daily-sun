CIVIL society organisation Judges Matter has slammed Advocate Malesela Teffo’s comments and allegations about Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela and want them withdrawn. After his dramatic withdrawal from the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial last month, Teffo made a U-turn last Monday, 25 July. In a letter to the NPA, Teffo made serious and damaging accusations against Maumela, among others. He went as further as accusing him of bewitching him and being biased. Judges Matter said it condemns in the strongest terms the attacks against the judiciary as an institution, and judge Maumela specifically. Co-ordinator of Judges Matter Alison Tilley said Teffo’s letter accuses Judge Maumela of all kinds of impropriety in the manner the judge has been running the trial, including accusations of being biased. She said that the most troubling thing was that Teffo’s allegations were based on speculation and conjecture, and he hasn’t put any evidence to support them. She said it was important to emphasise that as a legal practitioner and officer of the court, Teffo took an oath to uphold the constitution and the law, and promote the proper administration of justice. “The allegations made in his letter bring the administration of justice into disrepute and constitute a serious breach of professional legal ethics. The statements made in Teffo’s letter are a shocking attack on Judge Maumela and should be withdrawn. It is distressing that they come from a legal practitioner,” she said. Responding to the organisation, Teffo said Judges Matter is advised to mind their own relevant business and respect sub judice principles for other legal issues belonging to different parties.
