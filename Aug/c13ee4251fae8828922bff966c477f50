HOME Affairs has been dragging its feet with issuing her ID and now Nomcebo Nyalunga’s life is on hold. The 27-year-old said in 2016, she went to apply for her ID in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Officials told her to bring her mother’s death certificate and letters from her school and the hospital. She said after she submitted the documents, they said they would call her for an interview but this never happened. Nomcebo, from Sabie near Mbombela, told Daily Sun she visited Home Affairs many times but only received the phone call in March, six years after applying. “They told me to come with my aunt. I went there with my aunt and we did everything,” she said. Nomcebo said she was told she would get a call when the ID was ready for collection but she was still waiting. “My child doesn’t have a birth certificate because of the ID situation. My life is stagnating and I can’t look for work or further my studies,” she said. Home Affairs manager in Mpumalanga Ndalisa Jele said the matter was with the immigration department for investigation.
