FOR almost two years, motorists have been ducking a big pothole on the R101 road around Ramotse in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane. So a resident, Dick Mathebula (54), who lives near the pothole, decided to guard it. He told Daily Sun he stayed on the road until 10pm directing motorists not to drive through the pothole. He said he put wood and reflectors before the City of Tshwane put up barriers to prevent accidents. Dick appealed to the authorities to fix the problem before someone died. “I hope the authorities will hear my plea and do something about this because I am struggling to sleep at night,” he said. A motorist said he passed the area almost daily and the pothole was a huge concern. “We don’t understand why it’s not fixed as it is on a busy road,” said the motorist. Gauteng Roads and Transport spokeswoman Melitah Madiba said the damage was caused by a contractor appointed by the City of Tshwane to install a stormwater pipe. “The department will do further assessments to investigate the extent of the damage,” she said.
