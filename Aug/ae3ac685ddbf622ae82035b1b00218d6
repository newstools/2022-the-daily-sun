A 23-YEAR-OLD woman from Koster in North West was stabbed to death, allegedly by a man against whom she had obtained a protection order. Neo Molusi was stalked and brutally killed on Saturday, 30 July, allegedly by her abusive ex-boyfriend and baby daddy. Neo’s mother, Tlaki Molusi, said her daughter had been in the relationship with the man for a long time. “This was not the first time he stabbed her,” alleged the mother. “I begged her to leave him. She kept forgiving him, saying he threatened to kill her when she tried to end the relationship.” She said she asked family members to intervene and she finally broke up with him last year. Neo’s younger sister, Palesa Molusi (18), said she saw her sister take her last breath. Palesa said the accused jumped the fence wall and forced entry into the house. “He stabbed her three times and ran away,” she said. “I can still hear her voice begging him not to kill her.” The accused appeared in Koster Magistrates Court on Monday, 1 August. The case was remanded until 11 August for a formal bail application.
