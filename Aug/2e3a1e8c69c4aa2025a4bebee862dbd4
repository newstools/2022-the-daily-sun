POLICE have launched a manhunt for a police officer who escaped from custody in the Eastern Cape. Constable Mfundo Ntshiba, stationed at the Cala cop shop, escaped on Monday 25 July at about 6pm and hasn’t been seen since. Ntshiba was arrested alongside Xolile Makhosini for house robbery and kidnapping. It’s alleged that Ntshiba and his three alleged accomplices broke into a loan shark’s house and stole an undisclosed amount of cash, including bank cards with pin codes and kidnapped her two brothers. The robbery took place at Ndondo Square in Cala on 5 July. The two other suspects remain at large. Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said: “Eastern Cape detectives are searching for the awaiting trial prisoner who allegedly escaped from police custody on 25 July at about 6pm at Cala Police Station, in the Chris Hani area. “Constable Ntshiba was among the detainees who were transported from Cala Magistrates Court to Sada prison. He appeared in court on 25 July, but later escaped after returning from court when he was about to be dropped from the police vehicle to the holding cells.” The suspect was initially arrested for house robbery and kidnapping. He said a case of escaping from lawful custody has been opened against him for investigation. “The circumstances under which the suspect escaped also form part of the investigation. Police management established a task team to trace, track and find the fugitive constable. “Members of the community are advised not to attempt to arrest the suspect, as he’s believed to be dangerous. Anyone with information that can lead to his immediate arrest is kindly requested to please contact sergeant Unati Kula at 071 771 3316 or any nearest police station,” said Kinana.
