THE family of Someleze “China” Ndleleni was left horrified after he was killed outside his home on Thursday night, 28 July. The 20-year-old from Samora Machel, Cape Town, went outside to meet friends and a few minutes later, his father Zadeki Maqwara (57) heard the sound of gunshots. When Zadeki went outside, he found China and his friends lying in a pool of blood. China and one of his friends died while another one is fighting for his life in hospital. Zadeki told Daily Sun: “I’m terrified. His death came after his uncle was just shot and killed two days ago in the area. “The painful thing was that he was shot in broad daylight. “The sun was still out and people actually saw it happening.” Resident Sibongile Kwangi told the People’s Paper that there had been a number of shootings in the kasi over the past two weeks, and young boys were the victims. “As residents, we are now living in fear of these attacks because you don’t know what’s going to happen next,” he said. The mum of the survivor, who didn’t want to be named, said her son would not return to her house. “They may finish him off if he came back home,” she said. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said a double murder case was being investigated. “The motive for the attack is unknown. The unknown suspects are yet to be arrested,” said Swartbooi.
