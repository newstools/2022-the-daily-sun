STOAN Seate says he used to spend huge amounts of money on useless luxuries and he now knows it was the wrong way to live his life. The member of legendary kwaito group Bongo Maffin said he sometimes spent R3 000 a day on clothing and parties. But he is now advising up-and-coming artists not to follow the path he did. Stoane, who attended Daily Sun’s 20th birthday in Bryanston on Friday, said those mistakes taught him harsh lessons that allowed him to be where he is today. “I encourage them to read a book called The Richest Man in Babylon. “It will teach them how to manage and make money. “Young people must behave like how our grandfathers behaved and tackled life. The old people were very wise in using their wealth.” Stoan said his biggest regret was not studying further when he was young. He advised young artists to back up their music career with education.

He said he was working on combining his poetry with his artistry to create something completely new. “People have always seen me performing with Bongo Maffin, featuring other artists. “They also saw me presenting Afro Cafe but no one has seen me put together all these elements into a story,” he said. Stoan said he always feared being a villain but he made himself a hero by defeating self-doubt. Stoan said he would host a legacy show called Lentswe Tshipi at Sun City in September. He said the show would feature a mixture of traditional and modern poetry. Stoan said he would officially announce what he would be doing with the new show, which would also empower young people, today, 1 August.
