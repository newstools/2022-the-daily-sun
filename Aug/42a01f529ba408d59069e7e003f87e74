TEACHERS and pupils from Botsebotebo Secondary School stormed Eskom regional offices in Sebokeng, Vaal, on Monday morning, 1 August demanding a transformer for their school. They also went to the education department’s offices in the area to hand over their memorandum of grievances about the electricity problem. The transformer that the school shares with a nearby community was damaged in February last year, and they’ve been without electricity since then. SRC member Rethabile Tsotetsi (15) told Daily Sun that the school paid Eskom R1 million to have its own transformer. Rethabile said it was hard for the pupils and teachers to do their work, and that the electricity problem has affected the school’s last year’s matric results. Sebokeng department of education district director, Themba Maseko, promised the pupils that the problem will soon be resolved.
