CUT off rapists’ 4-5s and ban booze! That’s the message from ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) member Violet Siwela. Siwela said this while speaking to hundreds of mourners at the funeral of her cousin, the slain traffic cop Thabo Mashego (35), in Xanthia, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on Sunday 31 July. “The biggest corruption is rape and booze,” she said. She said there should be a decision at the ANC conference in December that those men found guilty of rape should have their 4-5s removed. Just recently, police arrested illegal miners in connection with the rape of eight women in Krugersdorp, Gauteng. The women were part of a crew filming a music video near a mine dump. “Parents must stop negotiating rape matters at home with the perpetrators. They must report them to the police,” she said. “Booze is not a profession. Instead of having more taverns, we must have more churches. Only a sober society will respect God.” She said people should stop blaming the ANC or President Cyril Ramaphosa. Siwela said when she was at the ANC policy conference recently, she emphasised that the challenges the country was facing were everyone’s business. She said that was why the policy discussion document they were preparing ahead of the December conference came from decisions made by 90% of branches. “These days, people in politics are no longer there to serve the poor but to loot and damage society,” she said. “That’s why we need your views as these are not Ramaphosa’s challenges alone. Let’s help this government to govern properly and deal with corruption.” She said people who stole money were now saying the step-aside rule must be scrapped. “Let them bring back the money. Stop blaming him and the ANC,” she said.
