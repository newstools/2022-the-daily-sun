RESIDENTS of Monakato outside Rustenburg, North West, have had enough of crime. They said the high rate of hijacking, house robberies and theft were among some of their concerns According to the residents, police came at about 2am on Thursday, 28 July, to make arrests for a murder that happened last week. This after men, believed to be suspects of theft, were beaten up by the community. Resident Loyde Mokonyana said: “The police station is useless.” Another resident, Mapula Ramela, said the police broke into her home to arrest two of her children. “We’re still traumatised by what happened. I am still confused as to why my children were arrested.” On Thursday, angry community members took to the streets to demand intervention. They blocked the entrance leading to Monakato and the R510 road was affected. Community Police Forum chairman Christopher Rakuba said Phokeng Police Station was of no use to them. “For many years now we have been complaining about poor service. Registered cases are never solved. Police fail to report to crime scenes when called. They only come when community members decide to fight crime on their own.” Police spokeswoman Captain Aafje Botma said that cases of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping were opened following an incident where three men were allegedly assaulted by a group of people. Botma said the group had accused the victims of housebreakings in the area and one of them died in hospital. “Five people were taken in for questioning.”
