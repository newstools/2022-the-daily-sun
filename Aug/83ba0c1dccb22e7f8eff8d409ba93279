THE man accused of murdering his mother and chopping up her body appeared in court on Monday, 1 August. Teboho Mokoena (30) had initially opted to represent himself but he asked the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court in Free State to give him seven more days to consult with his legal team from Scorpion. He also asked for a postponement to consult with his legal team at his last appearance. Mokoena is facing charges of murder and attempted murder. During his bail hearing, the court heard how the victim’s head, legs and hands were cut off and stuffed inside a plastic bag. The body also had a stab wound to the chest. It’s alleged the deceased was raped before being murdered. Family spokesman Mohlomi Khodumo said the accused was playing delaying tactics. “We want the court to finalise this matter. We cannot afford to come here every week. We want to close this chapter. Our hearts are bleeding,” he said. National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Phaladi Shuping said new charges might be added as the investigation continued. Mokoena was arrested on Wednesday 8 June after he allegedly butchered his mother Modiehi (62) and stabbed his father Motsumi (65). The court postponed the case to 30 August.
