HE knew about his spiritual gift when he was only 12 years old. And at the age of 29, Pakisi Machaba finally answered the calling. But now the 33-year-old from Polokwane, Limpopo, has dumped his amadlozi to become a born-again Christian. And he couldn’t be happier. Pakisi told Daily Sun that amadlozi caused him a lot of sadness. “When I went to initiation school, I expected things to get better but nothing did,” he said. He said when he was 17, he was told at church he had a prophetic gift but he tried to suppress it. “I had to deal with the consequences. My wife had numerous miscarriages, I lost my job and my loved ones got sick,” he said. Then his wife left him and he fell sick, leading him to accept his calling. “I went to initiation school for six months and after that, I started initiating others.” However, nothing got better. His finances got worse and his girlfriend lost their baby. Last year, he dreamt of someone telling him to ditch amadlozi and become a Christian. “This confused me and I told my gobela, who advised me to talk to my ancestors about this. I tried but didn’t get answers. I started praying hard about it and this voice appeared in my dream again, telling me to quit being a gobela,” he said, adding that he was no longer training thwasas as the ones he had, had already graduated. Pakisi listened to the voice and his life improved. “My finances started getting better. I now have seven published books and my health has improved.” He said he referred his former clients and others who try to consult to his gobela. One of his thwasas (37) said: “His decision made me question my own ancestors.” She consulted with her ancestors who helped her understand that their presence in her life had nothing to do with Pakisi as he was merely a guide.
