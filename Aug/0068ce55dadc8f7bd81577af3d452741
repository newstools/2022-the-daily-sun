THE corruption case against former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede and 21 others, might only be heard in 2023. This comes after the matter was postponed by the Durban High Court on Monday, 1 August to 11 August for further pre-trial hearings. NPA regional spokeswoman Natasha Kara said the matter was adjourned for the defence to make submissions regarding the financial state of some of the accused. She said during previous appearances, some of the accused’s defence advised there were no funds for them to represent their clients and the trial could not proceed. Kara said two of the accused were not represented and their attorney had to withdraw. She said they would hopefully get more information from Legal Aid regarding representation for the accused. “The state was ready for the trial. So what happened on Monday follows the pre-trial conference held last month in chambers,” she said. “The judge had issued a letter regarding media filming proceedings in court. “Sanef presented themselves in court and advised that they were bringing an application in opposition to that.” The court ruled they would have to apply on 5 August to lodge that application. She said in terms of the date of trial, there was mention of setting it for the second session, which would be in 2023. Gumede spokesman Ntando Khuzwayo said they were sad, but expected more delays. “Mama Gumede is ready. Even today, through her legal team, she asked if her matter can be separated so that she can proceed,” he said. He said because of the ANC step-aside rule, having this cloud hanging over her head was harming her career.
