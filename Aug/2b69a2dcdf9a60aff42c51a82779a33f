A WOMAN said she was gang raped by four men on her way home from groove after she rejected one of them. The 25-year-old from Alexandra, Joburg, told Daily Sun she had never seen the men before but they threatened to kill her if she told anyone what had happened. She said she was alone at a party spot on Friday, 29 July, as her friends had left to go to a second place and she stayed behind to finish her drink. She said one of the four men then approached her. “He told me he liked me and asked for my number. I refused and he didn’t take that well. “He started getting violent and grabbed my arm so we could go talk outside,” she said. She said someone saw what was going on and intervened. “The guy left me alone but I didn’t feel safe anymore. A few minutes later, I decided to leave,” she said. The woman said while she was waiting for a cab outside, the men grabbed her, put her into a taxi and drove off. “I noticed one of the men was the one who asked me out and I knew I was in trouble.” She said the men drove for a few minutes before parking somewhere. They then took turns raping her. “They threatened to kill me if I told anyone about what had happened.” The woman said they dropped her off and she called her mum. “We went to the police station to open a case but you could see the judgement on the faces of the officers. We haven’t even received a case number yet,” she said. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Netshiunda advised the woman to visit the station or phone to inquire about her case. He said there could have been a delay in registering the case. “An inquiry at the station would be of great assistance,” he said.
