WHEN she started to have the same nightmares every night, she became terrified of going to bed. But the nightmares just got worse and her life soon started falling apart. She lost her job and her boyfriend and now she’s starting to lose her eyesight. The 40-year-old woman from Pretoria West, Tshwane, grew up in a Christian household and didn’t know what was wrong until a friend advised her to see a sangoma. The woman said after consulting four izangoma, she finally understood that bad luck would only stop following her once she went to thwasa. However, she was unemployed and couldn’t afford to thwasa. “One sangoma told me I would go blind if I didn’t do what my ancestors wanted from me. I am already partially blind and this scares me a lot.” The woman appealed to SunReaders to help her follow her calling. “I know some SunReaders are traditional healers. I would appreciate it if a Good Samaritan could help me thwasa,” she said. Traditional healer Majoko Hlongwane confirmed the dreams and blindness were a sign that the woman needed to thwasa.
