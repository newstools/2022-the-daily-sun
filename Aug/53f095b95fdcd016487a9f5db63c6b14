BISHOPS and pastors prayed at Lepono Primary School after at least 15 pupils fainted after seeing a rat the size of a cat. The incident at the school in Mathibestad, North West, happened on Friday, 29 July. Teachers organised the day of prayer, which took place on Monday 1 August, to fight the evil spirits that had been bothering pupils. Parents said grade 5 pupils saw the huge rat during lessons and were so traumatised they started scratching their faces, saying they felt itchy. Some of the pupils were taken to Mathibestad Clinic and others were transferred to Jubilee Hospital in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, after the incident. Parent Popi Jokonya (34) said she was still shocked by the incident. She said her 10-year-old child saw the rat. “We don’t know what is happening at this school, but this is not the first time we hear about something like this.” Moretele Christian Moral Regeneration Ministers Fraternal chairman, Archbishop Jacob Mphiwa, said they decided to pray for the children because there was an evil spirit attacking them. Cosas North West, chairman Matlhatsi Manaka, said members attended the prayer session to support the school. Moretele Mayor George Manyike said that the pupils were being provided with support. Education department spokesman Elias Malindi said the faith leaders also provided counselling.
